The Moonglows' first release on the label, a swooning doo-wop ballad called Sincerely, written by Fuqua and co-credited to Freed, and with Lester taking the lead vocal, reached No 1 on the US R&B hit parade in 1954, but the greater success of a cover version by the McGuire Sisters prevented them from rising above No 20 in the pop charts (the original version was later used by Martin Scorsese in his film Goodfellas).", "label": "human"}

One group kept the name Riksmål as their own unofficial form of Norwegian, and ignored the spelling and grammar changes of the Samnorsk movement. Riksmål and conservative forms of Bokmål have been the standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century. Large newspapers, encyclopedias, and a significant proportion of the population of Oslo, along with surrounding urban areas and much of the literary tradition use them. After the reforms of 1981 and 2003, the official Bokmål can be adapted to be almost identical with modern Riksmål. Today, the differences between Riksmål and Bokmål are minimal.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Newfoundlands originated in the fishing villages of Newfoundland, Canada from which they        get their name. For generations, they assisted fishermen by hauling nets and fishing        carts, rescuing shipwrecked sailors and providing companionship during long days at sea.         Eventually making their way to Europe and the U.S., they became popular working dogs,        show dogs and pets. Back in Newfoundland, however, you can still find them working hard        with the fishermen. They are classed as working dogs and because of their        intelligence and desire to please can be easily trained for pulling, packing, retrieving        and water rescue. They provide great pack support for backpacking especially if one has        small children. Bred to work long days in the intense wet and cold, Newfoundlands make        dependable outdoors companions. Whether on long hikes in the woods or long days in the        field, these dogs have the work ethic and durability to handle extreme weather and dirty        jobs. They also love a good swim-no matter what the conditions.", "label": "human"}

A reasonably realistic wax head is on the dressed sekeleton, topped with a broad-brimmed hat. He holds his walking stick in his hand and he is seated. Most people know this. But I recently realized I only had a hazy notion of what he was doing by presenting himself as an Auto-Icon (his term). So I looked at the authorative University College London Bentham Project website to get an answer, and was surprised that there is room for speculation about this. Is this a secular momento mori? Or perhaps a macabre kind of statue created by a slightly vain man who was seeking posthumous immortality? Or is there some other more plausible explanation? Is this really not known?", "label": "human"}

Mascots act as a significant vehicle for communicating the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially children and youth.

{"text": "Dehydrating does not damage enzymes. Moisture evaporation from food acts as a cooling process and keeps the temperature below the actual air temperature in the dehydrator. In his book Enzyme Nutrition, Dr. Edward Howell explains that because of the difference in food temperature and air temperature, it is safe to dehydrate at settings up to 145 degrees because the temperature of the food will not exceed 118 degrees. Enzymes are most susceptible to damage by high heat while they are in a wet state. This is why cooking is so damaging to enzymes. Dehydration uses far less heat than cooking or baking. As the food becomes drier, the enzymes become more stable and can withstand temperatures of 118 degrees or higher.", "label": "human"}

The impression they left was profound: “Rock’s  Second Coming had truly arrived.” The following night he went to see the band  at the El Paradise Strip Club and kicked into motion a devotion to following the  band through their rise and subsequent unravelling. Absorbing the scene and all  it entailed, Don recalls his personal encounters with Glen Matlock, Sid  Vicious, Malcolm McLaren (who he had been unimpressed by a few years before in  Let It Rock), and monumental moments such as McLaren playing a God Save The  Queen A&M acetate before the Screen on the Green April 1977 show: “That song  put the Sex Pistols into a whole different league.” He saw the Pistols for the last time at the Uxbridge  show in December 1977.

One such question that has stood the test of time is “If a tree falls in a lonely forest, but there are no animals around, does it make a sound?” In 1884, the authors of Scientific American answered a different form of this question stating that sound is the perception of vibratory impulses transmitted via air or other media. So although the tree will generate vibration, if there are no ears to perceive it, then there is no sound. However the reader chooses to interpret this question, there is one undeniable fact: the ear is an extremely important component in the perception of sound.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "I am a 51 year old gay man.  As a movie lover, I have sat through literally thousands of cinematic heterosexual love scenes in my life.  I have watched men and women \"suck face\" and caress each other's naked bodies until I was fairly nauseous.  For the record, I do not enjoy watching heterosexuals make love.  While it doesn't exactly revolt me, it certainly isn't something I find appealing, either, but I have had to put up with it as long as I can remember.  After all, one cannot go to a movie or turn on the television without seeing endless examples of graphic heterosexual lovemaking.  And guess what?  For all the sexually explicit straight love scenes I've sat through, I've managed to get through them intact.  My eyeballs haven't fallen out, my penis hasn't shriveled up and blown away, and I have not turned heterosexual from watching all that straight sex.  I would suggest to those who \"support gay rights\" but are \"uncomfortable\" with explicit gay sex scenes that they purchase a DVD of a gay film with about as much sexually graphic content as they think they can stand, and then watch it over and over and over until they are no longer uncomfortable with gay sex scenes.  I think that would be fair; after all, I have been forced to acclimate myself to straight love scenes to the point where they no longer make me uncomfortable.

Corcyra, island (1991 pop. 104,781), 229 sq mi (593 sq km), NW Greece, in the Ionian Sea, the second largest of the Ionian Islands , separated by a narrow channel from the Albanian and Greek coasts. Though rising 2,980 ft (910 m) at Mt. Pantokrator in the northeast, Kérkira is largely a fertile lowland producing olive oil, figs, wine, and citrus fruit. Livestock raising (poultry, hogs, and sheep) and fishing are important sources of livelihood. Tourism, centered in Kérkira city, the capital, has increased dramatically in recent years; the island is known internationally. The island has been identified with Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians in Homer's Odyssey. It was settled c.730 B.C. by Corinthian colonists and shared with Corinth in the founding of Epidamnus on the mainland but became the competitor of Corinth in the Adriatic Sea. The two rivals fought the first recorded (by Thucydides) naval battle in 665 B.C. In 435 B.C., Kérkira (then Corcyra) made war on Corinth over the control of Epidamnus, and in 433 it concluded an alliance (often renewed) with Athens; this alliance helped to precipitate (431) the Peloponnesian War . The island passed under Roman rule in 229 B.C. and in A.D. 336 became part of the Byzantine Empire. It was seized from the Byzantines by the Normans of Sicily in the 1080s and 1150s, by Venice (1206), and later by Epirus (1214–59) and the Angevins of Naples. In 1386 the Venetians obtained a hold that ended only with the fall of the Venetian republic in 1797. Under Venetian rule, the island had successfully resisted two celebrated Turkish sieges (1537, 1716). The island was under the protection of Great Britain from 1815 to 1864, when it was ceded to Greece. It was occupied (1916) by the French in World War I, and in 1917 the union of Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia was concluded there. In 1923, after Italian officers trying to establish the Greek-Albanian border were slain in Greece, Kérkira was bombarded and temporarily occupied in retaliation by Italian forces.

Like Billy, the opportunity to express myself artistically was a passport to a better, more fulfilling life. As a child, I dreamt of a career in music, escaping into my treasured record collection for inspiration and hope. It was the unfailing support of my mother and grandmother that helped me achieve my ambitions. With their encouragement and a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, I started building a foundation that has allowed me to rejoice in a musical career that has exceeded my wildest dreams. To see Billy literally dance his way out of the bleak and cruel environment created by the British mining industry’s demise was inspirational. To see Billy’s family rally behind his artistic gift moved me to tears. By the screening’s end, the audience response was overwhelming. As Jamie Bell took a glorious victory lap around the cinema, I had to be helped up the aisle, sobbing. The film had really got under my skin.”", "label": "human"}

On the other hand, its design,fabrication, assembling, stamping, etc are done in different countries and then marketed world over. Thus production and consumption are globally spread for most products. That is the international aspect of businesswe are concerned with. Available data suggest that Multinational Companies (MNCs) or MultinationalEnterprises (MNEs) are vastly responsible for the growth of cross-border or international production andmarketing.Economics, trade and finance know no national borders. By their nature these are not confinable through man-made fetters for long time. Economics, trade and finance are truly international, multinational, global andtransnational. We see the continents of the world and some nations are divided by waters. But, beneath thedepths of even the deepest Pacific Ocean, land mass unifies continents and nations.

{"text": "There is a theory that a truly great film director has to be obstinate and uncompromising to any opinion or advice anyone else on the film set would have, reasonable or not.Think about a director like Stanley Kubrick who was such a perfectionist that infamously required over 100 takes of the same scene.John Huston was another prime example, a man whom most people cited as being very difficult to work with. Paul Newman once described him as an \"eccentric's eccentric.\"Yet somehow he managed to make great films like \"The Maltese Falcon\" to be admired by many for decades to come.     When he was scouting for locations in Congo and Uganda for the shooting of his famous 1951 classic, \"The African Queen,\" he had brought along Peter Viertel to Congo and Uganda as a script doctor to accompany him.Viertel eventually published a fictionalized novel based on the experience called, \"White Hunter, Black Heart.\"The account was a brutal, unflattering portrait of a director who got distracted from actually making a film in Uganda to indulge in his infatuation with hunting down an elephant.     Bringing this novel to the big screen would seem of no interest to Clint Eastwood, who, before this film, had completed playing Dirty Harry Callahan in \"The Dead Pool\" from 1988.That is perhaps why audiences could not buy him directing himself playing a character based on Huston in \"White Hunter, Black Heart\" from 1990.That is a shame because the movie marked a significant shift in Eastwood's career from playing gruff, no-nonsense antiheroes like Dirty Harry and The Man with No Name to deconstructing that very persona in the movies he has directed himself in.Eastwood has been quoted as saying that he personally hates violence and his directorial efforts since then have attempted to present an anti-violence argument.     For Eastwood to play a larger than life legend like John Huston (the character's name has been changed to John Wilson in the film) must have required some courage.It is a daunting challenge for an icon to play another icon and some may be a little jarred by Eastwood's imitation of Huston's swagger and mannerisms in the opening scenes.But it handsomely pays off in a complex performance that takes his typical gruff, do-as-he-wants persona and deprives it of the masculine heroics.     The beginning scenes of the movie feel a little disjointed and do take a while to take form.We first see Pete Verrill (Jeff Fahey), the Peter Viertel counterpart, meet Wilson in his large mansion in London to discuss the script and write the final draft.The various scenes work well freestanding, including one where Wilson stubbornly insists on his need to shoot in Africa for authenticity in front of the film's producer, Paul Landers (George Dzundza) and the financiers.Yet somehow the expository moments of Wilson taking Verrill under his wing to lavish dinners lack cohesion.     Once they move to Congo and Uganda, the film takes shape into a journey of obsession.Wilson becomes entranced with the thought of killing an elephant, despite repeated warnings that they are already behind schedule on the film's shooting.Verrill serves as the crucial observer and the voice of reason.Not that Wilson really ever cares to listen, until it may be too late.     There is a scene early in the film that immediately lets us know that this is not going to be any kind of exciting action film or safari adventure.Wilson is mad at a British man who is being racist at a Ugandan waiter and picks a fight with him.We first see him winning until the tables quickly get turned and he gets pummeled to a pulp.This sets up the rest of the film, which strips away the heroics and the potential for cathartic release of violence found typically in Eastwood's action pictures.     Why is Wilson so bent on bagging an elephant?When Verrill finally confronts him, he does give an answer, which I won't reveal, except to say that it does not make his obsession any more comprehensible or justifiable to Verrill, Landers or anyone else. The buried implication is that a deep obsession by nature obliterates any sense of motive or purpose, if it ever existed at all.     \"White Hunter, Black Heart\" is not quite up there with Clint Eastwood's great films like \"Unforgiven\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" but it stands as one of his most interesting and ambitious efforts.It also serves as a key to understanding Eastwood himself, who has made a prestigious, highly personalized career from bucking his familiar character trends of yesteryear while working almost completely outside the normal Hollywood studio system.He has indeed continued to build an impressive resume as a filmmaker and he will perhaps also be remembered as a legendary director, just like Huston.", "label": "human"}

Both dingos and Basenjis lack a distinctive odor, and are prone to howls, yodels, and other undulated vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. One theory holds that the latter trait is the result of the selective killing of barkier dogs in the traditional Central African context because barking could lead enemies to humans' forest encampments. While dogs that resemble the basenji in some respects are commonplace over much of Africa, the breed's original foundation stock came from the old growth forest regions of the Congo Basin, where its structure and type were fixed by adaptation to its habitat, as well as use (primarily net hunting in extremely dense old-growth forest vegetation).", "label": "human"}

{"text": "First used in China , cannon were among the earliest forms of gunpowder artillery, and over time replaced siege engines —among other forms of aging weaponry—on the battlefield. The first hand cannon appeared during the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut between the Mamluks and Mongols in the Middle East . The first cannon in Europe were probably used in Iberia , during the Reconquista , in the 13th century, and English cannon were first deployed in the Hundred Years' War , at the Battle of Crécy , in 1346. It was during this period, the Middle Ages , that cannon became standardized, and more effective in both the anti-infantry and siege roles. After the Middle Ages most large cannon were abandoned in favor of greater numbers of lighter, more maneuverable pieces. In addition, new technologies and tactics were developed, making most defenses obsolete; this led to the construction of star forts , specifically designed to withstand artillery bombardment and the associated siege tactics.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Why, one might ask, did Swift have such a consuming contempt for the Whigs? This hatred began when Swift entered politics as the representative of the Irish church. Representing the Irish bishops, Swift tried to get Queen Anne and the Whigs to grant some financial aid to the Irish church. They refused, and Swift turned against them even though he had considered them his friends and had helped them while he worked for Sir William Temple. Swift turned to the Tories for political allegiance and devoted his propaganda talents to their services. Using certain political events of 1714-18, he described in Gulliver's Travels many things that would remind his readers that Lilliputian folly was also English folly — and, particularly, Whig folly. The method, for example, which Gulliver must use to swear his allegiance to the Lilliputian emperor parallels the absurd difficulty that the Whigs created concerning the credentials of the Tory ambassadors who signed the Treaty of Utrecht.", "label": "human"}

By its terms, Italy would receive the fulfillment of its national dream: control over territory on its border with Austria-Hungary stretching from Trentino through the South Tyrol to Trieste.

{"text": "Phonetics is often defined with respect to phonology. Both disciplines are concerned with the sound medium of language, and it is not useful to draw a hard and fast line between them. The centre of gravity of the two fields is, however, different. In general, phonology is concerned with the pattering of sounds in a language (and in language in general), and is thus comparable to areas of linguistics such as syntax and morphology which deal with structural elements of language at other levels. Phonetics is more centred on the way those structural elements are \"realised\" in the world, through movements of the speech organs which create the acoustic signal. Phonetics therefore has important links not only to linguistics but to natural sciences such as physics and anatomy.", "label": "human"}

As the Style Council 's career progressed, Weller's interest in soul developed into an infatuation with jazz-pop and house music, which eventually led to gradual erosion of his audience -- by 1990, he couldn't get a record contract in the U.K., where he had previously been worshiped as a demigod. As a solo artist, Weller returned to soul music as an inspiration, cutting it with the progressive, hippie tendencies of Traffic . Weller's solo records were more organic and rootsier than the Style Council 's, which helped him regain his popularity within Britain. By the mid-'90s, he had released three successful albums that were both critically acclaimed and massively popular in England, where contemporary bands like Ocean Colour Scene were citing him as an influence. Just as importantly, many observers, while occasionally criticizing the trad rock nature of his music, acknowledged that Weller was one of the few rock veterans who had managed to stay vital within the second decade of his career.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Like many other cities of Continental Europe, Vienna originated in ancient Roman times. In the first century AD , the Romans set up a military camp, called Vindobona, which formed part of the large number of similar facilities along the Limes frontier. The camp was situated in what is today the core of the city. The course of the wall is reflected, to this day, in a series of very striking streets in the inner city. From the third century, there is evidence for a civilian settlement in the southeast, a little outside the camp. Much less is known about its layout and buildings, however, than about the camp. Neither of these facilities on the site of the present city had any significance within the ancient \"cityscape\" of Austria.

{"text": "ur old friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote in 1830 that ‘in Cumberland and Westmoreland there is a cabinet of beauties.’ He particularly praised Derwent Water and the Vale of Keswick for the ‘air of life and cheerfulness’ there. Victorian tourists knew Derwent Water as the ‘Queen of the Lakes’ although it has to be admitted that some called it, somewhat less politely, the Devil’s Chamberpot, because of the frequent rain some people believe they get round here. Putting Borrowdale’s reputation for wet weather to one side for the time being, the Day 7 shelf of the ‘cabinet of beauties’ is crammed to bursting with goodies, so much so that today’s walk can be counted as a Lakes classic. Leave Keswick town centre towards the boat landings and the highly regarded Theatre by the Lake. Just before reaching the theatre, make a short diversion to the right onto the grassy slopes of Crow Park. This little hill, with its exciting view up the lake to the shapely and challenging outlines of Catbells and Robinson is a good example of a drumlin. Drumlins are elongated low hills made up of glacial till (boulder clay) deposited by glaciers. The exact processes involved in their formation are still open to debate, but it seems that the till is deposited by a moving glacier which then continues its journey over the material it has deposited to produce a laterally symmetrical mound of debris with a steep slope facing the direction of travel and a more gradual slope along the direction of flow. Or it could be that the shaping action is carried out by a second, later glacier after the first one has done the depositing. Drumlins are classic glacial deposition features and they usually come in large groups which, rather pleasingly, are called ‘swarms’. They are quite common in Cumbria, and there are some in the area around Kendal which we’ll be passing through towards the end of the walk.", "label": "human"}

In the earliest account, the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, the serpent is nameless and female, but later it is male, as in Euripides’ Iphigenia Among the Taurians, and named Python (found first in the account of the 4th-century-bc historian Ephorus; Pytho was the old name for Delphi).

The \"Great Hunger\", known as An Gorta Mor in Gaelic, happened in an era when millions of people knew only famine, oppression, and degradation.  The potato famine itself was a natural disaster such as a flood or an earthquake, and there is no way to predict when such an event will happen.  A fungus known as \"phytophthora infestans\" causes the blight itself.  But to be prepared for such an event and to deal with it in a correct and timely fashion is the important issue.  The English, the ruling body in all of Ireland at the time, did not remedy the situation, nor did they care to.  In fact, they seemed to do the opposite.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "There are actually two classifications of the stuff; low-level and high-level radioactive wastes. Low-level nuclear waste is the trash produced from cleaning materials and plant maintenance, similar to most industrial garbage with one difference; it's detectably radioactive. Low-level waste from nuclear plants is about equal in volume and radioactivity to the combined radioactive trash from hospitals, colleges, and research laboratories. And, it's usually less radioactive than the huge, un-monitored volumes of fly ash dumped daily from coal-burning power plants. (see reference 2, below) Regardless, low-level nuclear waste really isn't the issue here.

{"text": "Wonderful picture featuring a brilliant and surprising performance by Jim Carrey Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliant affair that boasts a very well crafted story and performances. Mixing elements of drama and fantasy, the film is a refreshing take on your traditional romantic film, and it delivers something totally different. I really enjoyed the film's path on how they handled the material, and Carrey delivers the performance of his career with this one. Since Jim Carrey is known for comedic work, this is a film that proves he is able to act in other genres of film. With this film, he breaks new ground in his career, and definitely makes the film that much better. The story itself is well thought out, and the direction is great as well. This is a terrific, entertaining picture that delivers an engaging two hours of solid entertainment. If you're looking for a well constructed drama that is original and not just another rehash, then this is the film watch. I honestly didn't expect much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The film might surprise skeptics, and it most certainly impressed me. I thought that this ranked as one of Jim Carrey's best, and it was nice to see him take on a more dramatic role as well. To me, it's always interesting to see comedy actors take on serious roles as we don't know what to expect, and in the case of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, we get a   surprising, well delivered performance from Jim Carrey that compliments a wonderful story.", "label": "human"}

Sir Alec, who played for Surrey and England, is bowling to brother Eric, who only played for Surrey, at the other end of the bridge.  Eric appears to have smashed Sir Alec for six – and to that end, a bronze ball has been lodged in the wall of Woking borough council’s civic offices on the other side of the road. The bronze statues, by sculptor Allan Sly, were unveiled by former prime minister and Surrey cricket fan Sir John Major, who famously said upon his election defeat in 1997 that he was leaving Downing Street and off to the Oval to watch some cricket that same afternoon – a refreshing sense of  priorities and of life after politics, some might say. There are two questions to raise about these statues, however. One question is: will/should they encourage impromptu games of cricket upon the Bedser bridge, to the inconvenience of passersby? The answer: probably not. Another question: why are the Bedser twins represented in their full, lifesize glory, while Woking’s other famous sons, The Jam, appear as three abstract blocks of wood on the other side of town? The answer: the Bedser twins grew up and lived in Woking throughout their lives. The Jam recorded a song about Woking titled Town Called Malice. The Bedsers never did that.", "label": "human"}

One scene in particular contains a truly amazing matching of sound to visuals that is the equal of any routine put on by an Olympic gymnast, especially given that it was shot in a single take. Perhaps, given that this was 1940, coincidentally the year that Walt Disney released Fantasia, I should compare this talent to that of a world class animator, but Chaplin was constrained by the laws of physics. He takes a venerable piece of classical music, one of the Hungarian Dances by Brahms, and turns it into an impeccably choreographed soundtrack for a shave in a barbershop.

The decoration of buildings was once the noblest function of fine arts, and fine arts were indispensable to great architecture. Today they exist in complacent isolation, and can only be rescued by the conscious co-operation and collaboration of all craftsmen. Architects, painters, and sculptors must once again come to know and comprehend the composite character of a building, both as an entity and in terms of its various parts. Then their work will be filled with that true architectonic spirit which, as “salon art”, it has lost.” … “Architects, painters, sculptors, we must all return to crafts! For there is no such thing as “professional art”. There is no essential difference between the artist and the craftsman. The artist is an exalted craftsman.” … “Let us therefore create a new guild of craftsmen without the class-distinctions that raise an arrogant barrier between craftsmen and artists! Let us desire, conceive, and create the new building of the future together. It will combine architecture, sculpture, and painting in a single form.”", "label": "human"}

Some former Systematic Ornithologists (Peters, Moore) put as \"lumbers\" a lot of different species like Goldfinch, Greenfinches, Linnet and Redpoll into the same genus. Looking at that big genus we see that there is less homology, only the yellow wing marking. The differences are much more: shape of the Greenfinch as one of the biggest and Redpoll as one of the tallest. The form of the beak also varies from cone to sharply pointed. But the main differences are found in song patterns and courtship behaviour. That brought the leading Phylogenists to a \"modern\" group of different genera: Chloris, Linaria, Acanthis, Carduelis and Spinus. My presentation will deal with the genus Spinus sensu stricto like shown above. The genus Spinus belongs to the family of Carduelidae which is the closest family to Fringillidae. Both were put together (see Peters Checklist) but again - there are some phenomena which can distinguish the two families: Species of the family Carduelidae have \"pouches\" where they store food for the nestlings during breeding season.

Therefore if it cost $10,000 to save a child’s life in Australia, and that $10,000 could save 100 lives elsewhere, no matter where, Australians should spend the $10,000 on saving the lives elsewhere. The great philosopher admitted that we might sometimes be allowed a slight partiality for our own children, but he did not say how slight; however, we should be grateful that he did allow at least a faint glimmer of sense to enter his worldview, it presumably having occurred to him that a world in which parents did not have a slight preference for their own children would be about as warm as the surface of Pluto.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "The following is a list of breeds of cattle. Over 800 breeds of cattle are recognized worldwide, some which adapted to the local climate, others which were bred by humans for specialized uses. Breeds fall into two main types, regarded as either two closely related species, or two subspecies of one species. Bos indicus (or Bos taurus indicus) cattle, also called zebu, are adapted to hot climates. Bos taurus (or Bos taurus taurus) are the typical cattle of Europe, north-eastern Asia, and parts of Africa – they are referred to in this list as \"taurine\" cattle, and many are adapted to cooler climates. Taurus/indicus hybrids are widely bred in many warmer regions, combining characteristics of both the ancestral types (such as the Sanga cattle of Africa). In some parts of the world further species of cattle are found (both as wild and domesticated animals), and some of these are related so closely to taurine and indicus cattle that interspecies hybrids have been bred. Examples include the Dwarf Lulu cattle of the mountains of Nepal with yak blood, the Beefalo of North America with bison genetics, the Selembu breed of India and Bhutan with gayal genetics. The Madura breed of Indonesia may have banteng in its parentage. The Dzo of Nepal is an infertile cattle-yak crossing which is bred for agricultural work.

{"text": "For a fixed earthquake size, the region of strong shaking can be an indication of the regional geologic structure. A particularly illuminating illustration of the effects of regional geology on earthquake shaking is presented in Figure 0-2. The region of damaging shaking is shown for two earthquakes with roughly the same size - the 1811 New Madrid earthquake and the 1906 California earthquake. The precise magnitude of the 1811 earthquake is uncertain since we had no seismometers available to provide instrumental measures of the shaking but indirect estimates suggest that it was a great earthquake. The great 1906 San Francisco earthquake had a surface-wave magnitude of approximately 8.3. The late Dr. Otto Nuttli of Saint Louis University estimated the intensities for the New Madrid quake by studying the newspapers and personal journals which contained reports of the effects of the quake. Since the land west of the Mississippi was sparsely settled at the time, the region of shaking west of the earthquakes is inferred using the shape of the region in the east. The old, eastern section of the US transmits seismic vibrations very efficiently relative to the relatively young, warm California coastal region. These observations suggest that for an equal-size earthquake, the east is likely to experience a wider extent of damage than coastal California. We are fortunate that earthquakes are less frequent in the eastern half of the continent, but the eastern half of the country has grown dramatically in a time of no large earthquakes. The next large earthquake to occur in the east has potential to produce substantial loss of life and property.", "label": "human"}

Like Thatcher, he embraced the fiscal policies of neoliberalism without the more \" libertarian \" perspectives of the Chicago school on social issues . He favoured cuts to personal income tax and business tax, lower government spending , the dismantling of the centralised wage-fixing system, the abolition of compulsory trade unionism and the privatization of government-owned enterprises , views that have dominated his subsequent career. He became frustrated with the more moderate and pragmatic Fraser, who would not embark on these steps. In 1982 Howard nearly resigned in protest at Fraser's big-spending pre-election budget. As Federal Treasurer, John Howard presided over a period of very high interest rates, peaking at 22% on 8 April 1982 [6] (see: RBA: Bulletin Statistical Tables ).

{"text": "Stirling has had a truly remarkable career, he raced from 1948 to 1962 and won 212 of the 529 races he entered, including 16 Formula One Grands Prix. He would compete in as many as 62 races in a single year and drove 84 different makes of car over the course of his racing career, including Lotus, Vanwall, Maserati, Jaguar, Ferrari and Porsche. Like many drivers of the era, he competed in several formulae—very often on the same day.  Moss was a pioneer in the British Formula One racing scene and placed second in the Drivers' Championship four times in a row from 1955 to 1958.  Sir Stirling Moss was also a competent rally driver and is one of only three people to have won a Coupe d'Or (Gold Cup) for three consecutive penalty-free runs on the Alpine Rally (Coupe des Alpes). In addition, he finished second in the 1952 Monte Carlo Rally driving a Sunbeam-Talbot 90 with co-driver John Cooper.  In 1954, he became the first foreign driver to win the 12 Hours of Sebring in a Cunningham, co-driving with American Bill Lloyd.  Moss's first Formula One win was in 1955 at his home race, the British Grand Prix at Aintree. His Mercedes-Benz W196 led home a 1–2–3–4 win for the German marque. This victory made Moss the first British driver to win the British Grand Prix.  One of his best remembered drives was in the 1955 Mille Miglia, which he won in the record time of 10 hours 7 minutes 48 seconds, finishing almost half an hour ahead of teammate Fangio in second place.  In 1957 Moss won on the longest circuit to ever hold a Grand Prix, the daunting 25 km (16 mi) Pescara Circuit, again demonstrating his skills at high speed, long distance driving. He beat Fangio, who started on pole, by a little over 3 minutes over the course of a gruelling 3 hour event.  In 1963, noted motorsports author and commentator Ken Purdy published a biographical book entitled All But My Life about Stirling Moss, based on material gathered through interviews with Moss.  Moss is the narrator in the popular children's series Roary the Racing Car which stars Peter Kay.  He is one of the few drivers of his era to create a brand from his name for licensing purposes, which was launched when his website was revamped in 2009 with improved content.  In 1990, Moss was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.  In the New Year Honours 2000 List, Moss was made a Knight Bachelor for services to Motor Racing. On 21 March 2000, he was knighted by Prince Charles, standing in for the Queen who was on an official visit to Australia.  In 2006, Moss was awarded the FIA gold medal in recognition of his outstanding contribution to motorsport.  Sir Stirling Moss OBE is a truly memorable choice for a personal appearance.

Studies have shown that <a href=\"//www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/cancer/\" data-mce-href=\"//www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/cancer/\">4% to 10%</a> of all cancers in the United States are caused by work exposures. And, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/skin/\">thirteen million</a> Americans are exposed to chemicals at work which can be absorbed through the skin.</p> <p>Knowing the kinds of jobs that pose an increased risk of occupational disease can help you take preventative steps to protect your health. You’ll be able to recognize the early symptoms of occupational disease and get potentially life-saving medical attention before it’s too late. You’ll also likely be able to file a workers’ compensation claim and receive payments for your medical bills and income loss. For more information on occupational diseases, see Nolo’s article, <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/an-overview-occupational-diseases-caused-work-exposures.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/an-overview-occupational-diseases-caused-work-exposures.html\">An Overview of Occupational Diseases Caused by Work Exposures</a>.</p> <h2>Where Do Dangerous Exposures Occur?</h2> <p>Thousands of potentially dangerous workplace substances can cause disease or illness. Although hazardous exposures often happen to workers performing manual labor, such as coal miners or farm workers, they can also happen in a more innocuous setting, such as in an office building where toxic mold is a problem. (For more information, see our article on <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/toxic-mold-health-risks-of-30056.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/toxic-mold-health-risks-of-30056.html\">toxic mold health risks</a>.) Some common jobs with known risks of occupational diseases are listed below. However, even if your occupation is not listed, you can get an idea of what exposures you should be concerned about and what symptoms to watch out for.</p> <h3>Miners</h3> <p>Any job that involves mining, drilling or blasting through the earth can expose you to harmful dusts that can cause disease, including silica (the most common mineral found in the earth). Inhaling silica dust can cause <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/silica-silicosis-health-risks-litigation-32206.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/silica-silicosis-health-risks-litigation-32206.html\">silicosis</a>, a serious, incurable, and sometimes deadly form of lung disease. Silica exposure can also lead to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Shortness of breath and coughing can be signs of silicosis or COPD. Other signs of silicosis can include fatigue, weight loss, fever, and chest pain.</p> <p>Coal miners are also at risk of developing black lung disease, which can cause permanent scarring of the lungs, difficulty breathing, and even death. For more information, see Nolo’s article, <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/black-lung-cases-workers-compensation.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/black-lung-cases-workers-compensation.html\">Black Lung Cases in Workers’ Compensation</a>.</p> <h3>Construction Workers</h3> <p>Like miners, construction workers who work with concrete, cement, insulation, drywall products, sanding, or drilling tools are also at risk of disease due to silica exposure. Construction workers also at risk due to exposure to wood dust. Wood dust can cause a variety of breathing problems, including nasal and sinus cavity cancer. Wood dust may also cause allergic reactions, asthma, and contact dermatitis (a red, itchy skin rash).</p> <p>Chemical fumes are also hazardous substances that put construction workers at risk. Products like insulation, paint, polyurethane, blown foam, carpeting, solvents, and glues can all release chemical fumes into the air, causing asthma or chronic bronchitis. Skin contact with these products can also cause contact dermatitis. Watery eyes, nasal irritation, or a sore throat are signs that these exposures are affecting you. If you have these symptoms or chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath, or coughing, see your doctor right away.</p> <p>Another serious exposure is asbestos. Construction workers who work on older buildings may come into contact with asbestos, which can cause <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/asbestosis-other-asbestos-related-diseases-33595.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/asbestosis-other-asbestos-related-diseases-33595.html\">asbestosis</a>, a serious form of lung disease, and <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/mesothelioma-symptoms-causes-asbestos-lung-disease-33071.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/mesothelioma-symptoms-causes-asbestos-lung-disease-33071.html\">mesothelioma</a>, a deadly cancer.

Many metals themselves are toxic when heated, but metal coatings can also be dangerous. Manganese (used in welding rods) is particularly harmful and is present in all welding fumes according to the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/welding/\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/welding/\">CDC</a>. Manganese can cause a Parkinson’s-like disease, which produces tremors, fatigue, headaches, problems with swallowing, and body stiffness. Welding fumes may also cause COPD and cancers of the lung, larynx, and urinary tract. Symptoms that should concern welders include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and dizziness.</p> <h3>Farm or Grain Workers</h3> <p>If you work with harvested grains and crops, you could be at risk of developing farmer’s lung. Farmer’s lung is an allergic disease caused by mold spores or bacteria found in crops, especially hay. The exposures can cause sudden asthma-like attacks hours after inhalation, or they can cause a slow onset of symptoms. Prolonged exposure can cause permanent lung damage and even death. If you experience a persistent cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, or if you feel like you have a lingering cold or generally feel worn out, you should see your doctor.</p> <p>Farm workers are also at risk of developing silo filler’s disease, which is caused by inhaling toxic gas from freshly harvested crops fermenting in a silo (a large structure used to store grain). Silo filler’s disease can cause serious lung disease or death. Symptoms can be immediate and life threatening within minutes of exposure, but usually occur within 30 hours. Coughing, breathlessness, dizziness, or a burning sensation in the chest should prompt immediate medical attention.</p> <h3>Cotton, Flax, or Hemp Workers</h3> <p>Exposure to dust from unprocessed cotton, flax, or hemp can cause a lung disease called byssinosis, or brown lung. Byssinosis symptoms can be similar to asthma symptoms and include chest tightness, wheezing, or coughing. Permanent lung damage is possible in workers with long-term exposure.</p> <h3>Workers Exposed to Diesel fumes</h3> <p>Diesel fumes can cause lung cancer and increase the risk of heart and respiratory disease. Diesel exhaust can irritate your eyes, nose, throat, and lungs, or make you nauseous or dizzy. Occupations involving diesel exposure include those where diesel equipment is run in an enclosed areas such as a mine, tunnel, or garage. Those who work on loading docks, bridges, railroads, and farms also can have diesel exposure. Proper ventilation and equipment maintenance can reduce the dangers of diesel-related health problems.</p> <h3>Workers Exposed to Noise</h3> <p>Working around noisy machinery and tools puts you at risk for one of the most common job-related health problems, hearing loss. The Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA) reports that about <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/\" data-mce-href=\"https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/\">30 million</a> workers in the United States are exposed to harmful noise levels each year. Long-term exposure to high noise levels can cause permanent hearing loss and ringing in the ears (called tinnitus).</p> <h3>Workers Exposed to Nylon Fibers</h3> <p>Those who work in areas where nylon is cut into small strands, called “flock,” can contract a disease called flock worker’s lung. Flock is used to make a variety of household items, including carpets, upholstery, and blankets. Workers who inhale the small airborne fibers can develop inflammation and scarring in their lungs. Symptoms of flock worker’s lung include chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath.</p> <h3>Aerospace Industry Workers</h3> <p>Beryllium is a light metal used in missiles, spacecraft, airplanes, and satellites. Beryllium can be absorbed through the skin and be an irritant. Inhaled beryllium can cause lung cancer or berylliosis, a serious and sometimes fatal lung disease. Symptoms of berylliosis are shortness of breath with activity, a dry cough, fatigue, and weight loss. For more information about occupations where chronic beryllium disease can occur see Nolo’s article on <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/beryllium-exposure-and-health-effects-32207.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/beryllium-exposure-and-health-effects-32207.html\">beryllium exposure and liability.</a></p> <h3>Flavorings &amp; Popcorn Workers</h3> <p>Workers in microwave popcorn plants and others who work with flavorings may develop a serious lung disease called bronchiolitis obliterans, or popcorn lung. Popcorn lung often causes a dry cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath that increases in severity. Frequent eye, nose, and throat irritation can also signal the presence of popcorn lung. According to the CDC, the flavorings industry has estimated that <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flavorings/exposure.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flavorings/exposure.html\">over a thousand</a> ingredients have the potential to be hazardous to workers’ health. If you work around products using a butter flavoring such as frostings, syrups, potato chips, cake mixes, and margarines, you could be at risk for popcorn lung.</p> <h2>What Should You Do If You Have Been Exposed to Harmful Substances?</h2> <p>If you are worried that you’ve been exposed to dangerous substances at work, you should see your doctor right away. If possible, bring labels from products that you suspect to be harmful. If your disease was in fact caused by work exposures, you will be able to file a workers’ comp claim against your employer. You may also be able to sue a third party that was responsible for the manufacture or distribution of the harmful substance or whose product failed to protect you from the harmful exposure (such as the manufacturer of failed safety gear).</p> <p>To learn more about workers’ compensation claims or possible lawsuits based on occupational lung diseases, see Nolo’s articles on <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/are-you-eligible-workers-compensation-32963.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/are-you-eligible-workers-compensation-32963.html\">eligibility for workers’ compensation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/workplace-injury-lawsuit-sue-30334.html\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/workplace-injury-lawsuit-sue-30334.html\">when you can sue outside the workers' compensation system</a>.</p>", "label": "human"}

They were written in tablets of stone by the finger of God. The story is recorded in Exodus 24:12-13: “And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.

{"text": "Alfred, Lord Tennyson was born in 1809 at Somersby, Lincolnshire. Schooled at Louth and by his father, a rector, he began to write early, and at the age of twelve he composed an epic of 6,000 lines. In 1828 he matriculated at Cambridge but only after the elder Tennyson had approved his recitation by heart of the odes of Horace. Poems, Chiefly Lyrical, published in 1830, revealed Tennyson s swiftly maturing talent, a talent which was augmented by his friendship with Edward FitzGerald and A.H. Hallam. In 1830, the poet and Hallam volunteered in the army of a Spanish insurgent; and Poems (1833) derived largely from experience gained on the Continent. Hallam s death in the same year gave rise to The Two Voices (1834) a black period in Tennyson s life. After a lengthy silence he published Poems (1842), earning the admiration of Carlyle and Dickens. The year 1850 witnessed his marriage to Emily Sarah Sellwood and his appointment as poet laureate, succeeding Wordsworth. The gravity with which he took his office was reflected in many poems on state occasions. His later years produced his acknowledged masterpieces: In Memoriam (1850), Maud (1855), Ballads and Other Poems (1880), Locksley Hall Sixty Years After (1886), and scattered sections of what would eventually become his epic, Idylls of the King (1859-1885). In 1892, reading his favorite Shakespeare, Tennyson died at Aldworth and received a public funeral in Westminster Abbey.\"", "label": "human"}

It measures approximately 16 km (10 miles) long and 11 km (7 miles) wide, giving 40 kilometres (25 miles) of coastline. Montserrat is often referred to as the Emerald Isle of the Caribbean, due both to its resemblance to coastal Ireland and to the Irish descent of most of its early European settlers. Its Georgian era capital city of Plymouth was destroyed and two-thirds of the island's population forced to flee abroad by an eruption of the previously dormant Soufriere Hills volcano that began on July 18, 1995.[3] The eruption continues today on a much reduced scale, the damage being confined to the areas around Plymouth including its docking facilities and the former W.H. Bramble Airport. An exclusion zone extending from the south coast of the island north to parts of the Belham Valley has been closed because of an increase in the size of the existing volcanic dome.

{"text": "There are various factors that affect the Earth's albedo. Snow and ice are highly reflective so when they melt, albedo drops. Forests have a lower albedo than open land so deforestation increases albedo (but for the record, no, chopping down all our forests is not the solution to global warming). Aerosols have a direct and indirect effect on albedo. The direct effect is by reflecting sunlight back into space, cooling the Earth. The indirect effect is when aerosol particles act as a cloud condensation nucleus, affecting the formation and lifetime of clouds. Clouds in turn influence global temperatures in various ways. They cool the climate by reflecting incoming sunlight but can also warm the climate by trapping outgoing infrared radiation from the surface.", "label": "human"}

A poster at the Southampton Oceanography Centre (authors are at SOC). Abstract: Bathymetric, hydrodynamic and side scan sonar are being used to investigate the sediment processes associated with a headland - Isle of Portland (Pingree, 1978). However, first results show a fairly symmetrical distribution of bedforms, being apparently associated with net bedload transport patterns. Instead of residual circulation the transient nature of the flow during the tidal cycle (transient edies) should be controlling the bedload transport patterns and, as a consequence, the formation of the sedimentary deposits is related to the gradient in bottom stress.  Some of the asymmetry of  the morphology of the deposits is due to the greater influence of waves on the west side of the headland. This will lead to hypotheses that will have general application to coastal zone sediment transport.  (data also provided to Dorset County Council)", "label": "human"}

{"text": "In early colonial times, correspondents depended on friends, merchants, and Native Americans to carry messages between the colonies. However, most correspondence ran between the colonists and England, their mother country. It was largely to handle this mail that, in 1633, the first official notice of a postal service in the colonies appeared. The General Court of Massachusetts designated Richard Fairbanks' tavern in Boston as the official repository of mail brought from or sent overseas, in line with the practice in England and other nations to use coffee houses and taverns as mail drops. Local authorities operated post routes within the colonies. Then, in 1673, Governor Francis Lovelace of New York set up a monthly post between New York and Boston. The service was of short duration, but the post rider's trail became known as the Old Boston Post Road, part of today's U.S. Route 1.  William Penn established Pennsylvania's first post office in 1683. In the South, private messengers, usually slaves, connected the huge plantations; a hogshead of tobacco was the penalty for failing to relay mail to the next plantation. Central postal organization came to the colonies only after 1691 when Thomas Neale received a 21-year grant from the British Crown for a North American postal service. Neale never visited America. Instead, he appointed Governor Andrew Hamilton of New Jersey as his Deputy Postmaster General. Neale's franchise cost him only 80 cents a year but was no bargain; he died heavily in debt, in 1633, after assigning his interests in America to Andrew Hamilton and another Englishman, R. West. In 1707, the British Government bought the rights to the North American postal service from West and the widow of Andrew Hamilton. It then appointed John Hamilton, Andrew's son, as Deputy Postmaster General of America. He served until 1721 when he was succeeded by John Lloyd of Charleston, South Carolina.  In 1730, Alexander Spotswood, a former lieutenant governor of Virginia, became Deputy Postmaster General for America. His most notable achievement probably was the appointment of Benjamin Franklin as postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737. Franklin was only 31 years old at the time, the struggling printer and publisher of The Pennsylvania Gazette. Later he would become one of the most popular men of his age.  Two other Virginians succeeded Spotswood: Head Lynch in 1733 and Elliot Benger in 1743. When Benger died in 1753, Franklin and William Hunter, postmaster of Williamsburg, Virginia, were appointed by the Crown as Joint Postmaster- General for the colonies. Hunter died in 1761, and John Foxcroft of New York succeeded him, serving until the outbreak of the Revolution.  During his time as a Joint Postmaster General for the Crown, Franklin effected many important and lasting improvements in the colonial posts. He immediately began to reorganize the service, setting out on a long tour to inspect post offices in the North and others as far south as Virginia. New surveys were made, milestones were placed on principal roads, and new and shorter routes laid out. For the first time, post riders carried mail at night between Philadelphia and New York, with the travel time shortened by at least half.  In 1760, Franklin reported a surplus to the British Postmaster General -- a first for the postal service in North America. When Franklin left office, post roads operated from Maine to Florida and from New York to Canada, and mail between the colonies and the mother country operated on a regular schedule, with posted times. In addition, to regulate post offices and audit accounts, the position of surveyor was created in 1772; this is considered the precursor of today's Postal Inspection Service.  By 1774, however, the colonists viewed the royal post office with suspicion. Franklin was dismissed by the Crown for actions sympathetic to the cause of the colonies. Shortly after, William Goddard, a printer and newspaper publisher (whose father had been postmaster of New London, Connecticut, under Franklin) set up a Constitutional Post for inter-colonial mail service. Colonies funded it by subscription, and net revenues were to be used to improve the postal service rather than to be paid back to the subscribers. By 1775, when the Continental Congress met at Philadelphia, Goddard's colonial post was flourishing, and 30 post offices operated between Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Williamsburg.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "\"Never Have I Ever\"...seen something so innovative in a long time. Unfriended, a new found footage horror film, is about a group of older teenagers whose normal social life on Skype turns in a nightmare when a supposedly possessed Skype account begins making threats. Exactly one year earlier, a girl named Laura Barns committed suicide after an embarrassing video of her was anonymously posted on YouTube. These friends discover that the account belongs to the late Laura herself. After making some threats, \"Laura\" warns that she'll begin killing people if secrets aren't revealed and justice isn't served. Unfriended takes a whole new approach to horror storytelling with the entire film being \"set\" on Blaire Lily's (Hennig) computer screen, and it works incredibly well. It's a very gripping concept, and while we're all expecting jump scares, which do happen about once or twice, the scares build up like all good horror films should...slowly and naturally. The tension is truly built off of the genuine feeling of a supernatural presence as well as some well-constructed creepiness, including Laura possibly being in one of the friends' rooms. Laura's threats progress into a game that brings up and reveals all kinds of rumors and secrets that this close group of friends have kept from one another, which include cheating and ripping off money.

The fear is further heightened with some terrific acting by a wide range of unknowns, with the best performance being from Hennig, of course.

{"text": "One of Lloyd George’s first moves was to summon Maurice Hankey to the War Office to ‘have a long talk about the personnel of the new Govt., the procedure of the select War Ctee., and the future of the war.’ [2] He asked Hankey to write a memo giving his view on the state of the war and as early as 9 December, Hankey spent the whole day with the new War Cabinet. [3] How more central could he have been to all of the discussions which finally approved Lloyd George’s decisions? [4] Unlike many of his contemporaries, Maurice Hankey was not surprised to find that Milner had been appointed directly to the inner-sanctum of Britain’s war planning. Unelected, unknown to many ordinary men and women, Lord Milner appeared as if out of the ether to take his place among the political elite charged with managing the war to ultimate victory. [5] Lloyd George claimed, laughably, that ‘I neither sought nor desired the Premiership’ and explained Milner’s inclusion as representing the ‘Tory intelligentsia and Die-Hards.’ [6] What lies. Lloyd George had always exuded unbridled ambition and had been plotting the coup against Asquith with Milner’s cabal for months. [7] His premiership was conditional on their support.

At the same time, Melville reviewed Mosses from an Old Manse, a book of stories and sketches by Hawthorne, in a prominent journal, declaring: “There is no man, in whom humour and love, like mountain peaks, soar to such a rapt height, as to receive the irradiations of the upper skies; there is no man in whom humour and love are developed in that high form called genius.” The review was a big wet kiss for Hawthorne.", "label": "human"}

Of course we had to do it, and the result is truly wonderful: an intensely tart, lightly sweet, slightly earthy liqueur with huge fruit flavor. Our blackcurrants come from a farm less than half an hour from the distillery. They arrive at the distillery still warm from the sun, with their woody little tops still attached, and are immediately dumped into our clear, un-aged brandy. After months of maceration, the solids are pressed off, and some sugar is added. Put a splash of Cassis Liqueur in your bubbly and you’re immediately transported to the Parisian cafes that made classic Kir and Kir Royale (cassis in white wine or champagne, respectively) so popular.", "label": "human"}

Overlords at Ford felt that they could not develop a similar small car as the production cost would be too high, so instead they set about creating a larger family car which would sell in huge volumes. The result was the Cortina, a distinctively-styled car aimed at buyers of the Morris Oxford and Vauxhall Victor, that was launched in September 1962. Until a modest facelift in 1964 it was branded as the Consul Cortina before simply being sold as the Cortina.

{"text": "Juliette Binoche was born in Paris, France, to Monique Yvette Stalens, a director, teacher, and actress, and Jean-Marie Binoche, a sculptor, director, and actor. Her mother was born in Czestochowa, Poland, of French, Walloon Belgian, and Polish descent, while her father is French. Juliette was only 23 when she first attracted the attention of international film critics with The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988). Roger Ebert , Chicago Sun-Times film critic with an international following of his books on film and TV reviews, wrote that she was \"almost ethereal in her beauty and innocence\". That innocence was gone by the time Binoche completed Louis Malle 's Damage (1992) (aka \"Fatale\"). In an interview after the film was released, Binoche said: \"Malle was trying direct and wanted something more sophisticated\". A year later, Krzysztof Kieslowski 's Three Colors: Blue (1993) was added to her film credits. After a sabbatical from film-making to become a mother in 1994, Binoche was selected as the heroine of France's most expensive ($35 million) movie ever: The Horseman on the Roof (1995). More recently, she has made The English Patient (1996), for which she won an Oscar for 'Best supporting actress' and Chocolat (2000).", "label": "human"}
{"text": "It’s long known that wooden barrels will ultimately change the characteristics of any liquid within, with the climate surrounding varying the degrees of flavours produced. This process was stumbled upon when wine use to be transported by sea, being exposed to the elements whilst being stored on deck. The long journeys meant that the wine carried a deeper flavour profile and colour compared to its original state, something that Joseph Noilly, a herbalist, wanted to take full advantage of. In 1813, Joesph worked on the process and recipe for what we would now know as Noilly Prat, ageing the wines outdoors and over four seasons. In 1850 Louis Noilly, son of Joseph, began ageing wines in the fishing village of Marseillan in the south of France, eventually forming a partnership with his son-in-law, Claudius Prat in 1855 from which Noilly Prat & Cie was founded and registered. Unfortunately, Louis Noilly died in 1865 and his daughter Anne-Rosine, widow of Claudius Prat, took over the running of the company for nearly 40 years.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "THE design of coins is determined by a tradition going back at least to the time of Charles II that the direction in which the head faces should alternate between the coinage of successive monarchs. The only exception to this has been the coinage of Edward VIII, who insisted on his likeness facing left. It is not clear whether this was an expression of rebellion against convention, or vanity, to show what he regarded as his better profile, containing his hair parting. Edward VIII abdicated before being crowned, and no new coinage was released into general circulation during his reign, although a few experimental pieces were produced. Some coins were issued in British colonies, but none with a likeness of the King, though an appropriate design (facing left) had been chosen. It was nevertheless determined that designs for the coinage of George VI, his successor, should be prepared as if that of Edward VIII had been produced and as if it had depicted him facing right, thus reinstating the original tradition. The coinage of Elizabeth II has been in accordance with tradition. Postage stamps are quite different. Ever since the first prepaid adhesive stamps were issued in 1840, all standard issues have shown the head of the reigning monarch in profile (except between 1953 and 1967, with a three-quarters view of Elizabeth II) and facing left. The direction appears to have been determined solely by the fact that the earliest were based upon a medal showing Victoria facing left: it is possible that the direction was selected to conform with the coinage then in circulation. The rule does not apply to commemorative issues: three such stamps were produced showing George VI and Queen Elizabeth; the couple are shown in full-face or in profile facing right. An early commemorative stamp of Elizabeth II also shows her full-face: commemorative issues since 1966 have usually shown a profile view based on the bust designed by Mary Gillick for the pre-decimal coinage. Regular issues have shown a crowned bust based upon a plaster cast by Arnold Machin, who also designed the decimal coinage. Since 1973, many have shown a profile silhouette of the Queen facing right. Certain postage stamps issued to commemorate royal weddings have not contained the Queen's head at all.", "label": "human"}

Diurnal birds of prey—hawks, eagles, vultures, and falcons (Falconiformes)—are also called raptors , derived from the Latin raptare, “to seize and carry off.” (In a broader sense, the name raptor is sometimes synonymous with the designation “bird of prey.”) The nocturnal birds of prey are the owls (Strigiformes). The condors (species of vultures) and the eagles are among the largest and strongest of birds. All birds of prey have hook-tipped beaks and sharp curved claws called talons (in nonpredatory vultures the talons are present but atrophied).
