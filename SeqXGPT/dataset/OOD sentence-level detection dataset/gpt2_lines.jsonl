{"text": "A move to Chicago brought them several releases on the Chance label, including a version of Doris Day's Secret Love, before they signed for the Chess label, run by the Polish immigrants Leonard and Phil Chess (originally Lejzor and Fiszel Czyz), who were becoming famous for their patronage of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and many other key figures in 1950s rhythm and blues.\n\nThe Chess brothers became hugely successful but were more interested in the music than in business. By 1953, though, it was clear that they'd have to move on and the Chess Brothers were soon joined by the bass player and leader of their earliest incarnation, Bob Welch, followed by other Chess brothers, including the saxophonist Pete Weber and keyboarder Bill Kaysen.\n\nThey recorded a new version of The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll's \"Just Like A Woman\" in 1954 when Frank Sinatra was around, although it wasn't a hit, before moving on to new projects. Bob Welch moved on to the Blues Brothers, a band of blues-soul musicians headed by the great Al Hirt, who helped make the Black Bottom Blues label from 1957, but it was the 1960s that gave the Chess brothers their biggest hits, including \"St. Louis Blues,\" \"Hallelujah Now I'm Here,\" \"The Weight\" and \"I Got The Blues My Momma Told Me To Keep Away.\"\n\nThe Chess Brothers' popularity was due, in significant part, to their self-titled 1964 album which featured \"The Weight\" and \"I Got The Blues\" as the lead single and had a similar formula as the old Chess Brothers' records, except they went much harder on the blues, especially on \"The Weight.\"\n\nIn 1973 the Chess Brothers put out an album in the Chess Brothers style called \"The Music of The Chess Brothers,\" which contained the title track, \"The Weight,\" \"St. Louis Blues,\" and the four songs on the 1974 album and a re-recording of \"Hallelujah Now.\" Frank Sinatra also recorded five of \"The Music of the Chess Brothers\" in 1973, and four of the other songs appeared on his 1974 album of the same name.\n\nAs with the Chess Brothers, however, the Chess Brothers weren't quite the success many had hoped for and their label was closed in 1975. The Chess Brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame that same year (in the 1990s they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame).\n\nIn addition to playing with blues and rhythm and blues artists, the Chess Brothers also performed with blues singers and other performers around the world, including The Rolling Stones, The Mamas & The Papas, Billy Ray Cyrus, James Brown, Janis Joplin, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, George Benson, Bob Seger, Paul McCartney, Chuck Berry, The Mamas & The Papas, Rufus Wainwright, Jerry Lee Lewis, Dolly Parton and Jimi Hendrix; they were also instrumental in creating a revival of The Five Stars.

{"text": "During the reforms to bring Nynorsk and Bokmål closer, others opposed the changes and decided to maintain the originals. A group of former pupils of the late Professor Bjarni Lagerström founded the Nynorsk-Bokmål Centre for Writing and Expression in 1965. They were joined by a handful of other members of the original centre. In 1970, the members of the original centre, now including Bjarni Lagerström and an outstanding number of others, united in forming the Centre for Nynorsk and Bokmål (SANS, 1969). Lagerström had continued work on a translation of \"T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land\". It took him four years to complete it and, at the time, Nynorsk-Bokmål's reputation stood as a direct result of the translation. Since then, the two dialects have been close enough to remain the major dialects of Nynorsk-Bokmål and the centre's work became primarily focused on preserving the original Nynorsk and Bokmål. In 1986, the Center for Nynorsk and Bokmål published an edition of the \"T. S. Eliot's\" translation, which was followed by another in 1993.\n\nWhile the revival of Nynorsk-Bokmål started from an interest in preserving the original Nynorsk and a desire to preserve the original language, it has been supported most strongly in an ideological support, rather than from any desire to preserve a local language or culture. As a result, it has attracted a lot of academic support as a means of gaining critical distance. The Centre for Nynorsk and Bokmål has always tried to be independent and has not been taken in by the political motivations of the Nynorsk region.[2] The Nynorsk Centre often does publish articles about Nynorsk dialects in their own journals and in Swedish historical periodicals, but it is an independent and autonomous political body and the publications are only used as a result of an agreement with the centre that the editors have signed and that does not take anything away from the Nynorsk dialect itself.[3]\n\nThe Nynorsk dialect and cultural traditions have had a long standing presence in Swedish literature and they can be found in poetry and song of Nynorsk origin. From the seventeenth century, people of some degree of proficiency in both Bokmål and Nynorsk had been in Sweden. They had travelled from one to other in ships from time immemorial.[4]\n\nThe traditional music of Nynorsk, the Swedish tradition of opera, the modern Swedish genre of concert theatre, and a great amount of filmic works were also influenced by Nynorsk and Bokmål. The Nynorsk dialect influences the traditional music of Nynorsk as well as in the music of modern concerts and in contemporary concert theatre. In Nynorsk and Bokmål dialect, the word for \"play\" is the word for \"cinema\". While the Nynorsk and Bokmål dialects have had a significant impact on Swedish literature, there has also been a significant influence on the musical tradition and culture of Nynorsk by the influence of the literary tradition and musical heritage, mainly from the older and more classical period and from the modern Swedish period. Due to both influences, Nynorsk has been more influenced by music, and traditional culture, than Swedish poetry or music, with a few exceptions.[5]\n\nThe influence of music, music traditions and folklore has been particularly strong in Nynorsk, where in the early part of the twentieth century, folk music (jarnsjö) played an important part in the lives of ordinary people.[6] The Nynorsk songwriters have been among the greatest in Sweden, as well as in Scandinavia.[7] The musical influence of song writers, especially in the earlier Nynorsk dialects, was most profound, especially in the years from the 16th to the 20th centuries, when in Nynorsk, the traditional music of folk songs was developed. The influence of music spread throughout Swedish culture and influenced the creation of most of the works from the earlier period in Norwegian and Swedish literature.\n\nThe literary influence of poetry and song in Nynorsk was strongest when modern poetry was written.

{"text": "Intertwined with the story of Oakroyd's travels are those of Elizabeth Trant and Inigo Jollifant, two similarly malcontented individuals. Trant is a former high-class prostitute in London, hired out as a dominatrix by wealthy clients; she is one of many prostitutes to feature, alongside Holly, Mrs Chatterley, and other fictional prostitutes who are simply employed to facilitate an episode of a different drama; she is also part of a group of women who were once prostitutes for John Dee, the master of the Round Table of the Round Chamber, and who are forced to work as servants for the British king as a result of a scheme that they themselves never wanted.\n\nJollifant's story of prostitution begins quite similar to the Trant story's of the rich's lust for wealthy women's bodies, as she has been hired out by \"the King's\" mistresses into working a variety of different parts of London, which has given her the opportunity to be a pimp, and a mother to the \"son\" of one of these mistresses. She also joins in the plot to kill John Dee's mistress, Elizabeth Arden and her sons. There is much tension between the women of Trant and Jollifant's journeys, though it is the most interesting element of the two in comparison to the Trant story's focus on their desire for revenge and their efforts to get more of the women whom they despise to pay for their suffering.\n\nThe women of both stories, however, have not been entirely unproductive to society; indeed, Trant appears to have achieved success in her profession and to have reared some children with the help of her clients, while Jollifant has been involved in her own personal story, helping the poor to build roads, establish schools, and establish hospitals. It was because of their efforts to better the life of the poor that they were driven to join forces with John Dee's circle and in 1828, they met under the influence of a hypnotized David Starkey.\n\nStarkey was a magician who had been hired by one of John Dee's apprentices; having been a member of the Society of Hermes, an ancient esoteric organisation with a long history, he was highly proficient in the occult arts, and a practitioner in Theosophy, the esoteric religion that the British were adopting at the time. As with all of the major groups and individuals who were associated with these events, particularly the Brotherhood of the Golden Dawn, his influence is significant to the events surrounding the Trant/Jollifant story.\n\nThe other major player in The Black Chamber is Peterloo (the name is also used to refer to a variety of other events over the last few centuries and also to a group of men who were convicted of witchcraft in England). Peterloo was a student of the occult and of the Order of the Garter, and he was one of the most influential (and perhaps most dangerous) occultists of the time to have travelled to London. Peterloo was a man who not only believed in the occult; although, as is often the case in esoteric circles, he seemed to believe only in certain aspects of it, he was also one of the first occultists to openly advocate the use of violence and even torture in an attempt to gain occult knowledge; he is remembered for being involved in the burning of a man at the stake after he was accused of witchcraft in 1755, which is arguably the most notable chapter in the persecution of witches before the nineteenth century. Peterloo's philosophy seems to have been that if one were to be willing and able to act on such beliefs, the world would become a better, more beautiful, and more interesting place; his ideals are very similar to that of Aleister Crowley, another prominent figure in the British occult movement of the time. When Peterloo visited London on his journey through Britain he, like many of the other participants in the British occult societies, began writing notes that would be later compiled into a series of books, all of which together form what is known as Lucifer's Hammer, which were to be sold throughout Britain – which Peterloo was also working for.\n\nPeterloo's association with the two stories that are described will be covered in more detail in separate articles, but a general summary can be offered right now by saying that there seem to be two key lines of connection between the two stories, one historical and one psychological.\n\nTrant and Jollifant's journeys begin with the story of one of their mistresses, Rose, who became so ill, she died, while Mary Gordon, Trant's lover and an agent in the conspiracy, was also killed.

{"text": "Since the first mascot in Olympic history made its appearance at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, Olympic Mascots have become a main element of the Olympic image. The most significant of these are the rooster, which is the symbol of the Games, and the scepter, representing peace and progress. Both have been given distinctive characteristics by their manufacturers which have helped them to become popular with their audiences.\n\nThe original rooster, called the Olympic Champion, was used in 1968 as a mascot of the Winter Games and then again at the Summer Games in Barcelona in 1984. Since the original mascot was a male, in the late 1980s a female Olympic mascot was created. The scepter became the symbol of Olympic peace at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. Each of these mascots has become the iconic symbol of a specific generation of athletes.\n\nSince the early 1990s, a new generation of mascots have become popular due to their individual attributes. Since the 1994 Barcelona Olympic Games, the famous Olympic rooster has been replaced by the Olympic Champion who has carried the spirit of a single athlete on the Olympic stage. These current mascots have also grown in individuality and appeal.\n\nThe Olympic Mascot\n\nAt the Olympics there are several mascot characters, chosen as well as produced specifically for the Games.\n\nArgentina – Rosita\n\nThe Olympic Champion, Rosita, represents the spirit of Olympic sportsmanship and the best traditions of international athletics. The rooster has also been associated with women's athletics. Rosita is often a black rooster with a red feather on his head and red hair.\n\nArgentina – Toto\n\nThe Toto is a yellow pig who always greets the athletes, even in the stadium. Toto is the official mascot of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. He is an ancestor of the iconic and popular T-Rex, and was the first animal to be used for a mascot by a sports club on the field. It is difficult to say which of the Toto's attributes would be the most appropriate for the Olympics, because each year two different roosters are used.\n\nEngland – Jack\n\nJack is an enormous bulldog who accompanies England hockey players during the home and away games and is frequently carried in the team bus. An English version of a rooster, Jack was brought to the United Kingdom by British Airways at the turn of the century prior to travelling to London to represent the country in the London Olympic Games.\n\nEngland – Poppy\n\nPoppy, the national symbol of the United Kingdom, has become the official mascot for the London 2012 Olympic Games. She has been around since 1896, and her characteristics of being a white and red-headed dog are both British.\n\nGermany – Kerberia\n\nThe Kerberia is also known as Schutzhund or Rottweiler. In the games, a Kerberia is carried by each squad of the German team. At the same time, the Keburia is carried by each member of the winning German squad, the winning Belgian Squad, and of the winning Portuguese Squad.\n\nHungary – Fuchsia\n\nThe Fuchsia is also known as a \"Gorilla Girl,\" and has helped keep in contact with the members of the German nation with her bright red hair and large orange eyes. The gorilla was first seen in Budapest in the 1980s dressed in a gorilla suit. In 2004, the Fuchsia became a symbol of the Games and is used on T-shirts, handbills, and souvenir magnets, where she is often accompanied by the phrase \"Welcome to the best Olympics in world.\"\n\nItaly – Chucky\n\nChucky is also referred as \"La Vittoria\" or the \"Voodoo Child,\" and has played a key role in making the games memorable. The doll, named after the famous children's author and illustrator Agatha Christie, was made available for sale in 2005 and first appeared at the London 2004 Olympic Games in Aquatics. Many have tried to imitate the popularity of Chucky in both Europe and the USA, but none have succeeded on a truly global scale.\n\nNew Zealand – Winston\n\nThe Winston is a large pikefish, with the body and tail of a great white and the head and fins of a salmon. Winston is the mascot for the 2014 Olympic Games in Athens.\n\nRussia – Masha\n\nThe Masha has become synonymous with Russia.

{"text": "Dehydrating does not damage enzymes.\n\n\nThe key to the effects of sodium lactate is the acidity or alkalinity of the urine and the pH of the fluid. High pH, like that found in the more acidic urine of people with diabetes, prevents the sodium lactate from breaking down. The kidneys need to be flushed with pure water and then rewarmed with pure, undiluted water in order to reabsorb the alkalized sodium lactate and prevent its production. This means that the urine is acidified and it can become more concentrated when the body is deprived of sodium lactate. Diabetic kidneys are less able to convert the sodium lactate and their concentration increases.\n\n\nDiabetic kidneys are more prone to the formation of toxic substances from the salt or sugar crystals. This can be caused by a lack of sodium in the diet or due to sodium intake that is too high, which is often the case with diabetics.\n\n\nEven severe dehydration in the form of starvation cannot cause permanent damage to the kidneys. Even if it leads to malnutrition, the body is able to replace sodium which helps to relieve the high calcium levels.\n\n\nWhen sodium intake is normal, high sodium concentrations may be normal for many years on a long term basis. However, if fluid intake is limited, sodium concentrations can develop too high (as water-retaining foods become scarce) and can cause excessive water retention and dehydration.\n\n\nDiabetes, hypertension, hypertension are all signs of the kidneys responding to a reduced sodium intake and the body's response to this is to increase the concentration of water (hydration) in the urinary tract. This is what happens to the kidneys when people are diabetic and in some circumstances sodium concentration in the urine increases rapidly. This is a very complex issue which will be discussed further in a separate section.\n\n\nWhat are the common causes of high water retention\n\nWater-retention foods: As we discussed, because of their very high levels of salt, many processed foods and snacks, especially those containing sugar, lead to sodium leaching from the cells and into the urine which is the main cause of water retention and to cause it to be more obvious during meals when the sodium levels of foods are higher. This can also be due to the high consumption of soda, coffee and other soft drinks with high levels of sugar which do not allow the kidneys to completely absorb the sodium, which is then deposited into the urine and the body is forced to retain the stored water.\n\n\nHigh salt intakes: Foods high in salt, such as salted meats, fish and chicken and eggs, which are commonly eaten in Westernized countries, lead to high calcium levels and the concentration of salt in the blood and urine. As a result of these nutrients' high concentrations in the body, the kidneys can't hold them as well and the sodium excretion system keeps on pumping more of these nutrients into the urine.\n\n\nHigh salt concentrations in the diet: In addition to foods, people often have to take sodium to compensate for sodium inadequacies in their diet. High sodium intakes in combination with high calcium intakes in an animal may lead to the kidneys excreting too much salt, which results in high sodium levels in the urine and water-retention and water-storage disorders.\n\nHigh salt intakes leading to increased water retention and water-retention are also sometimes seen in people who are elderly or people who are taking medications that have high levels of sodium in them.\n\n\nHypokalemia: Too much salt also leads to low potassium, which is an important mineral in maintaining balance in the body. This is because potassium is critical for the functioning of the heart and blood vessels, the nervous system, the immune system, bones, teeth and muscles. Diabetics who are deficient in potassium may experience a drop in blood pressure, muscle cramps and muscle weakness, in addition to lower levels of potassium in the urine and muscle potassium levels.\n\n\nSodium-lactate link: When the lactic acid (and energy) within the body is released in the form of hydrogen chloride (a very weak acid) from the stomach, it is what causes high levels of water loss in addition to sodium in the urine. When this happens, if too much of this hydrogen chloride is in the body, it may cause damage to the kidneys and lead to water retention, which can lead to dehydration and high blood pressure.\n\n\nThe key in dealing with this problem is to take care of acid-base balance in your body by maintaining a diet rich in fresh vegetables and fruits, which are loaded with potassium to keep the potassium", "prompt_len": 36, "label": "gpt2"}

The crowd went wild as Led Zeppelin performed \"Whole Lotta Love.\" This wasn't Led Zeppelin's first time playing here. The previous April, they had closed out the Nashville Days Festival at the Centennial Arena with another of their huge hits, \"Rock and Roll\" (a song they'd debuted earlier that evening, with a cover of it on the sound system).\n\nBut that night, Led Zeppelin was even bigger, bigger than they were that night at Nashville Days. It felt big like a spaceship on a voyage to another galaxy, and no one could have been prouder.\n\nFor five hours, the music pulsed and thrashed through the empty room, the crowd dancing and singing and leaping and sweating in front of a wall of amps, all while the lights of the audience streamed in through a giant screen above them.\n\nWhen all was said and done, Led Zeppelin had come out in front of 5,800 people.\n\nThe night had been something that had never happened before, and its magnitude seemed to rival that time Led Zeppelin played the Centennial Arena. But the rest of the world wasn't ready for it, and neither was Led Zeppelin.\n\nNow when there's a concert crowd of 100,000 people at a major concert, like the one in Nashville over Labor Day weekend, the band is used to people in the building, walking onto stage or standing behind the boards as they listen to one song or another. But this evening's event was something entirely different.\n\n\"I saw some of the musicians on the wings, and it was amazing,\" says Dave Brock, who was in line waiting to get tickets to the show when a crush of people spilled into the front row. \"That was the first time I saw a show like that. When I think back to it, I don't know if I was ready.\"\n\nIndeed, the night seemed surreal, surreal. There had been hundreds of media representatives and hundreds of people inside and outside the venue at the moment Led Zeppelin hit the stage. And the audience was getting bigger with each passing song and each band member's introduction (\"I'm the kind of guy who likes to listen,\" says Bonham of his ability to \"dissect the music into a million sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sects\").\n\nLed Zeppelin never tried to act as though they were some mass-publicity-saturation band. By the end of their performance, they were completely oblivious to their audience's excitement, though they certainly knew it was happening. Bonham, whose eyes were fixed firmly on the stage, said that while he didn't know where the excitement came from, he appreciated it.\n\n\"I don't think it's a good idea ever to take your enjoyment for granted,\" he told the crowd.\n\nBackstage, John Paul Jones was in shock. The excitement was palpable. He had just returned from a solo concert in San Diego and, in his 20's, was still completely consumed by the idea of the 100,000 people in the crowd. \"It wasn't until later than the next morning,\" he tells Rolling Stone, \"and the people started coming around me, and they started saying to me, 'You shouldn't tell me this, but you thought that was huge!' I said, 'That's not true, but that's great, I guess and what a surprise!'\"\n\nAs part of the night's celebration, Led Zeppelin invited their Nashville friends to come up onstage with them for some songs, and they surprised the crowds by introducing several of the guys in the band who weren't on the national tours that were their normal focus. The result of the surprise was one of the biggest crowds of the entire tour: 1,700 people. The next night, at the Troubadour in New Orleans, the whole show felt bigger than the Centennial Arena show, thanks to a crowd of more than 590,000.\n\nBut just three days later, at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, the entire band was equally mystified.

{"text": "Philosophers are known to coin thought provoking sayings that leave individuals in awe. Take \"There is no difference between a fool, and a wise man.\" Or how about \"There is no honour in being right.\" Philosophers are quite honest. They do care, at least a little bit, about what you think of them—but they're not quite above being just plain proud of themselves.\n\nBut as you might imagine, some philosophers might go so far as to claim they're merely being polite and they don't believe the way others do. Some of the most renowned philosophers of all time, though, have gone out of their way to prove that there is in fact no such thing as being right. In fact, some of their arguments are so eloquent and persuasive, that they have the potential to inspire you to join their side.\n\n1. \"Socrates never lied, even in telling himself a lie.\"\n\nHannah Arendt\n\nOne of the most celebrated philosophers in history, Hannah Arendt once wrote that Socrates never lied. In real life she couldn't be more wrong. After all, it seems that in our day and age people are constantly trying to convince each other of everything—sometimes by lying, sometimes by actually lying, but not always.\n\nIn his famous \"Five Points\" of political philosophy, Plato, while not specifically referring to the notion of lying, suggests that people should be honest and truthful with each other. His reasoning is that the only truly truthful thing is self-knowledge, and if we are not able to discern the truth ourselves, we can always find it.\n\n2. Plato writes, \"Forgiveness is a necessary component in friendship.\"\n\nAristotle\n\nThe words \"necessary\" and \"component\" are especially fitting for a philosopher. After all, it's impossible to be a good friend and to be in some sort of dispute. That's what friends are for, after all. But when Aristotle wrote these words, he'd already put his finger on the problem. In order to maintain the truthfulness of friendship, we have to believe that people who disagree with us—we can't argue with them, right?—must change. Not in their own opinions. Instead, they must be willing to give up their beliefs in order to be able to understand other people. This belief in \"forgiveness\" is an interesting idea, especially because this philosophy is rooted in the Buddhist teachings. Why is this important? Because we're usually taught to forgive and forgive, no matter what we've done wrong. Why not make amends?\n\n3. \"Aristotle teaches that in our dealings with other people, we should learn to see the wisdom in everything, even the foolishest things.\"\n\nWilliam James\n\nHave you ever wondered what would be the point of being an expert in something if no one would ever learn anything from you? That's why you need to keep on writing and teaching. Otherwise, we really end up not learning anything.\n\nAristotle is known to have said, \"Aristotle taught that everything we do should be done with a view to the good of everyone who is affected by it.\" It could be the case that Aristotle also wasn't just kidding when he said that we should always try to educate ourselves—what else would it be? If Aristotle were writing today, he probably would have added one other little tip.\n\n4. \"We cannot think with someone other than ourselves because others cannot think with itself.\"\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nIf Einstein were still alive, we'd assume he'd have some sort of idea about this. There are some pretty profound philosophical principles at work in the theories that Einstein developed. He may not have developed these at the time when he was developing them, but it seems only natural that he would have a lot to say about this, because he is known by the likes of Barack Obama as being the \"Princeton of our age.\"\n\nSo I had a thought. If we could somehow somehow be able to meet and understand someone like Einstein—someone who had so many ideas behind so many incredible discoveries—what would we learn in the process?

{"text": "I first began to read about the Beagle in the course of my work as an evolutionary biologist, and as I learned more and more, I was struck by the fact that so many statements about her, in works on Darwin and others connected with the second voyage, contradict each other. The following questions came up repeatedly in this regard, which were discussed in the first of many posts at Beagle in the News.\n\nAre the statements about her factual or metaphorical?\n\nDoes she exist, in a literal sense, or is she merely the idea of an organism, a myth, or some kind of mythological creature? Is she some sort of being or spirit?\n\nDid she really exist on that voyage, or is she some sort of fable and a kind of fantasy? In other words, is there any substantial historical record of the Beagle in the form of records other than myth, including her voyage notes? If this fact is not known, does this mean that she is simply a fictional character, like Shakespeare's characters? Or was she a real person like Darwin, and was he ever on a voyage like the Beagle? Was there a real Beagle sailing around the world at some point?\n\nWhy are her adventures just a story and not a real expedition, such as that of Ferdinand Magellan in the early 1600s, or that of Captain Cook in 1820-1821? What is the difference? It's a matter of semantics, after all. Are we talking about a literal factual account of an expedition, a voyage on an actual ship, or something of a different nature, such as a novel and an account of a fictional character?\n\nThe Beagle in the News\n\nWhy do we need to know that the Beagle did exist? Well, if she had, we wouldn't have to ask, and we wouldn't have to ask those questions; otherwise, we would lose out on a chance to learn some fascinating facts about a real person. We have had such a chance. One can now get information about the Beagle using a variety of sources, and those sources are usually cited together in a single search.\n\nOf course, the Beagle is not the only example of an account of a fictional character. We have our Sherlock Holmes, and the Sherlock Holmes stories are famous, but they are literary works, not historical ones. I think that, in some cases, we may want to know the historical record as to a fictional character that is part of a historical record. For example, we had that possibility with the Beagle and we did learn many things about her, but it is easy to lose sight of the fact that there is also an account by a real scientist named John Charles Darwin.\n\nJohn Charles Darwin and his voyage\n\nAt first sight, John Charles Darwin's account seems to be a fictional account of his voyage. He tells tales of people like Hilda, Captain Bligh, and a beagle named Spottswoode. His book My Voyages, Travels and Researches in the Northern Parts of the World is full of these tall tales, and many of them bear almost no resemblance to the actual events. Why did Darwin do this? Are they really just tall tales, or is there a kernel of truth in this work and in others like it?\n\nWe have a rich record of his personal experiences and reflections. For example, Darwin wrote the following in 1848:\n\nNow I am, without any exaggeration, a more melancholy man than I was a while ago, the same melancholy that the melancholy of the Beagle made me feel at first and, in a few years afterward, the melancholy of my own age and those whose affections are almost entirely turned to my own. The whole tendency of my mind has gone toward melancholy. It is the most disagreeable state of mind a man can be in, and the effect of it upon me is felt by that same melancholy that the Beagle must have produced upon that poor creature. As the years go on, the effects of this melancholy become more and more marked, and after many disappointments the melancholy in my heart has almost left me forever; so it was almost an impossibility with me at the time of the Beagle, to bear the full force of the full responsibility that the Beagle had carried away into her heart. If I could have done anything else for her – had any kind of influence upon one of those poor, dear creatures – it were an infinitive miracle", "prompt_len": 272, "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "Many castle s were built during this period, but they are greatly outnumbered by churches.\n\nChurch ruins are still visible all over the place, though they are not as common as in the first centuries AD.\n\nWhen I visited an ancient village near Drogheda, it struck me at first glance that one of the things that stands out is the huge cemetery for a town well-known in medieval times. The cemetery dates back to the 4th-5th centuries AD, during what is called the Diocese of Laodicea, the largest and most celebrated diocese from the latter decades of the Roman Empire.\n\nI was able to visit the cemetery during a brief stop during a tour of the village. The church of St. George is one of two or if you are interested, the entire Diocese of Laodicea, and the old church is now a museum of the Church of the Holy Martyr St. Agnes, which dates back to the 8th century AD.\n\nWhat should come to mind immediately when you see the pictures of the graveyard are the tall tall oak trees, standing close together. The trees of the cemetery are well over a thousand years old, with an estimated length of over 1,200 feet. These trees still bear fruit year round.\n\nWhen you are looking at the pictures, do you think of the idea of a man? You may find these trees resemble Christ, or the Virgin Mary, or God. While these trees were planted by the Roman church, the story goes that the first church built and inhabited around here, the Old church, was built by one of these trees. The stories I had heard about this place made it sound great – people who would come here every morning would go with their daily prayers, while sitting on the old pine tree of their daily daily prayers on the first morning they would pray.\n\nOne of things that seems to be unusual among these ancient people are the large number of small mounds built deep in the ground of the village, on the southern portion of their own property. I found one of them myself, about 100 yards north-northwest side of the old church in the village, and I will have to look a little deeper into it soon, but it seemed to me the building of these mounds was important.\n\nMany people believe there was some kind of underground city that used to be here before they were driven from the area, and they believe that this large mound that could have been built in a matter of months is connected to the underground city – something that could have helped fend off raiding enemy tribes many years before. One explanation that has been offered is that these mounds were probably created to serve a purpose related to agriculture – some sort of large mound was likely dug out to keep the fields from being overrun by wild animals – I still want to look into that one.\n\n\nThe other theories I've seen have connected the mounds with ancient water channels, as if the water came from a spring somewhere. The possibility that the mounds can also be linked to a secret underground structure still seems to be very plausible to me, and there did seem to be a well at the site.\n\nThe fact that the mounds had a well in them seemed to be confirmed to me when I drove past the site on the way out of the village. This village has a lot of ancient houses and some really impressive churches.\n\nIf you visit the area, I would recommend the Old church as well as other churches that are still standing in that area along with many other churches, such as St. Stephen's, St. Mary's, St. Ambrose, St. Ambrose's and even St. Thomas at the very site it was torn down in the 1800s for a large car park.\n\nA good photo for this post\n\nThe village also boasts a very well-preserved Roman church. In the medieval times when the village was founded (around 600 AD), there was not much, if any, construction in the area. However, as the castle of Drogheda is more or less still standing today, the church is the main building, and the fact that it was still used as a church at the time when it became a castle, tells us that it was a popular place to", "prompt_len": 90, "label": "gpt2"}

As far as I'm aware, people with other sexual orientations don't discriminate against their homosexual relatives, or the parents of their homosexual children.\n\nYou may think that people that fall into that category are weird or a little weird, but we are not any less of people than you are. We just happen to fall on the same side of the spectrum that you do.\n\nMy entire family consists of 5 females and 17 males.

I've been married for 23 years, and I have never had any kind of controversy with my wife.\n\nMy wife isn't a lesbian. I have no problem telling your son that she's not. My wife is not gay. (What the hell do you think she is, an actress??) Not even close. My wife is a woman in her 60's. Yes, I'm a man in my 50's, but it doesn't give him the right to bully anyone.\n\nYou may think that we don't care about our religion, but it is not the truth at all. When my wife and I go out to dinner, the first meal out is always my wife's birthday; she is the only one who does that. My wife is a born-again Christian. Many people, including my wife, look up to me as a role model because of my strong faith. When my wife takes my children to go camping with her family, she takes them to a Christian campground. My grandchildren were baptized by the church and my grandson was baptized as an infant. My wife does not have any gay friends. I'm not a gay man. I haven't had sex with another man in over 40 years, but I am a homosexual. My wife and I aren't in a relationship because we love each other enough to make that happen. I am the most loving and devoted husband, father, and grandfather I could ever imagine. My family and I couldn't be more pleased with how our lives have turned out.\n\nSo please don't accuse us of being evil Christians. We are not.

It was popular for almost every one of his films, as well, including the 1958 comedy A Few Good Men (1957) and the 1963 comedy Song of the South (also titled \"Hands in the Sky\").\n\nOther films that also include \"Hands in the Sky\" include the 1940 film The Red Badge of Courage (1940), in which Fred plays a black man trying to defend a white woman who appears to be cheating on her husband.

Nancy, meanwhile, was \"curious, observant, worldly. She was curious, imaginative, passionate about music.\"\n\nShe even attended an opera rehearsal one day, \"thinking maybe there would be some dancing – there wasn't.

It's not worth the risk to him whether he wins the bet.... That's not who he is, that's not who he will be,\" says Jankauskas.\n\n\"He's not about winning by making a bet.

She gives me a piercing look and says, \"I would like to be, but we won't have time to think about that now.\"\n\nAnd then she smiles, giving me a knowing gaze that suggests there's at the very least no doubt about our relationship.\n\nSo, how did I get here? If you have ever wondered where the idea for this column started, you're in good company.\n\nI was sitting in my living room while my daughter and I discussed something, and we noticed that most of our friends are getting divorced at an even higher rate than us. And when you go online and look at what most people consider the biggest problems in our society, divorce seems like a relatively low-cost solution to them.\n\nAnd yet, that's exactly what we're finding in real life: Almost everyone's got something else to worry about, and when those friends ask about what they're doing about getting divorced, they're given a few sound bites that usually end with, \"You know, I'm not totally sure, but I feel like it's something to talk it out with my partner — and maybe go to counseling.\"\n\nAnd then everyone goes home and does it, without really having even thought about what their partner needs. I guess we all think divorce is easy. We know it must be. My daughter tells me that we've become so accustomed to divorce as a solution to the ills of our generation that we forget we could be doing a lot better.\n\nI remember when I was in fourth grade, I met a friend of ours from Catholic school. We spent a lot of time together before the end of the school year, and now we sort of see each other all the time.\n\nAbout a year after we started going out as friends, we started to see each other more often — and it didn't seem all that different from the way we met my wife — though she'd never really said a word to me about our relationship. It was like we'd known each other forever, but we weren't really in touch.\n\nThat's when we started to think about going to church, one Sunday when I asked her, \"How do you feel about me becoming your boyfriend?\" Now even though I was still in the fifth grade, and we were both just starting to have sex with each other, it felt like it was a big step for me. It made me feel like I wasn't so alone anymore — like she was there with me. That's how we started talking more with each other, and soon we were dating — and not at all in a typical Catholic sense. We weren't dating the \"right\" way. We were dating the \"wrong\" way.\n\nWe weren't dating the right way. We were dating the \"wrong\" way.\n\nWe dated for a couple months (with Abby being mostly the catalyst), and then had the idea for the column. Abby and I had always talked about being together — we were pretty close and we'd been friends for years. Then we started doing things like watching movies with one another and going out to dinner with each other. So, I mean, that's exactly how this column was born: we began talking about all this stuff and decided to be together.\n\nWhat started as a little experiment from Abby and me would soon evolve into something much larger.

One seller, with almost a dozen different ones, has had the original designs going back over half a century. And yet, all were \"no-show\" for a reason.\n\nWe went to auction to find out.\n\nIt was a cool fall day in New York City, so I went to the United Nations Plaza to watch a basketball game. I got lucky and saw a bunch of vintage cars going by, including some vintage Corvettes and some rare Italian sports cars. One was a beautiful Pinto.\n\nMy good buddy Sam was driving a 1980 Plymouth Cuda and he said to me, \"How about a bunch of your old Wade Whimsies go on auction in a few years?\"\n\nSo I began checking the listings, but there was no sign of Wade Whimsies anywhere. There was a lot of speculation, but also very little knowledge.\n\nEventually I found an interesting link to an ad listing, then a search of auction.com and I stumbled upon the listing of a single Wade Whimsie.\n\nHe was asking $7,900.00 and all of the lots over 9,000.00 were filled. He even had photos with some of his 'em in the process of being \"purchased\" by the seller.\n\nI called the seller and discovered that he is a gentleman by the name of George Miller. He is based in California — and I have to say this guy is a complete badass.\n\nHe told me that he knew exactly how to handle things, even when it comes to collecting Wade Whimsies. He told me that he worked at a department store in Los Angeles, so he was familiar with the \"rules and regulations of collecting.\"\n\nAfter a bit of negotiation, I was able to secure the car for over $7,000.00.\n\nThen the fun parts started.\n\nI decided that it would be a good time to make a couple of comments.\n\nSome of the collectors out there — I can hear you thinking –have no idea what they're getting into and think that no one buys them. Well, I would have to disagree. Everyone on the Internet is pretty much crazy about stuff that they're passionate about. But as a fellow collector myself, it is my job to try to keep things in perspective and know what you are really looking for.\n\nThe more I looked, the more I really love this car. Here are some of my quotes, which are from emails I received from other collectors for their insights.\n\nI will let these comments speak for themselves:\n\nI love this vehicle. I do have to say though, the car could use some serious TLC from some very capable garage to bring it back out of retirement. It is absolutely gorgeous! Also, as someone in the automotive industry, I am so pleased and excited to see a classic car be restored and brought back to life. Finally, the vehicle looks fantastic with all the work that has gone into it. You could see this car sitting, almost untouched, in the center of a modern car show. It is truly one of a kind.\n\nOne more thing, this is a beautiful car and I have owned other vehicles. However, nothing compares. I love the vehicle I have now and I am absolutely delighted with the results of the restoration of the car by Mr. George Miller. I would love to see it be restored further to its former glory and that is why the sale price is a bit high. I hope the auction proceeds will be sufficient for that to occur.\n\nThis Wade Whimsie was my first ever car. I was so excited. It now has an incredible new owner just trying to realize it's full potential!\n\nThe car is gorgeous. No wonder it sold. It's an astounding work of art. Great restoration by a true master.\n\nAbsolutely amazing car. It has a new owner now who is just starting out with vintage cars. To get a car like this to come back to life is fantastic.\n\nReally well done. This is a masterpiece. It is a car that should look and act like it has never been driven. But, it does. The car looks absolutely great. Great job at restoring the car. I hope you will keep this car as an absolute work of art.\n\nA true gem of a car. What George did to this car is a masterpiece. A truly one-of-a-kind classic that I hope I can get a look at someday.\n\nAfter I bought this Wade Whimsie, I read all sorts of opinions about how a Wade Whimsie should not be restored.

{"text": "Unfortunately, as Bennett Greenspan pointed out, Y-DNA doesn't usually  last more than 100 years in the remains of a dead person whose body isn't  well-preserved (such as frozen or mummified), so direct testing of Khazar  bones may be impossible, but on the other hand some advances have  recently made possible the testing of ancient DNA from bones, teeth, hair,  etc. which may show an early genetic history.\n\nEven if Y-DNA may not have entered the DNA of modern Jews through conversion, most Jewish scholars will argue for Jewish-Khazarian continuity; Y-DNA shows continuity among all Jews and is found in all the ancient Jewish communities. This makes sense because the genetic lineage of the Jews goes back millions of years and is almost the entire same branch as every other branch of humanity.\n\nThe DNA is derived from Neanderthal and Denisovan (a common human ancestor) DNA in these people who lived around the same period as our ancestors (including the ancestors of today's Jews).\n\nNow the DNA is not enough alone to prove Jewish continuity; a historical account will have to be provided to support it. In particular, we need to find out who the first Jewish ancestors were.\n\nThe Khazars lived from what is known today as the 7th century BCE to the 5th century CE, and were the ruling Jewish kingdom from the 11th century CE until their defeat by King Gnut's Genghis Khan in 1240 CE. Gnut's reign was the last period of continuous Khazar rule.\n\nThe Khazars ruled over all of what we today call southeastern Europe and Russia, stretching from Germany to the Caspian Sea.\n\nToday, about 30 million Jews live in the USSR and many more outside Russia. There are estimates of 4.3–4.9 million Khazarians still living in the past.\n\nThe Khazar people have the following characteristics:\n\nThey have long hair and eyes.\n\nTheir skin color ranges from blond and red to dark red and yellow.\n\nThey have dark eyebrows and white skin.\n\nThey have large, broad noses and small, pointed ears.\n\nThey have straight eyelashes as well as strong straight eyebrows.\n\nThey have wide, thick eyebrows and small eyes.\n\nThey have high nasal creases.\n\nThey have big nostrils located on front of the face.\n\nThey lack the long, pendulous noses typical of Jews today.\n\nThe most distinctive features of the Khazars, though, are their heavy-handed and oppressive rule; their distinctive hair color, especially blond;, and their narrow, elongated, and slightly protruding jaws.\n\nThe Khazarians, the most hated group in history, did not assimilate and did not mix with other people. Instead, they maintained their separate identity and culture throughout all of their existence, even after they were conquered and forced to assimilate by the Mongols.\n\nSome geneticists have theorized that a portion of this Khazar heritage came from a few isolated individuals who converted to Judaism before or after the Mongol conquest of Khazaria [1]. Many anthropologists and historian think that there is no proof of a Jewish Khazar tribe.\n\nBut one thing is certain—the large amount of people that could have converted to Judaism at Khazaria's time is so astounding that it makes a strong case for a Jewish Khazar identity.\n\nOther Evidence for a Jewish Khazar-Khazarian Connection:\n\nSome other evidence that a Khazar connection was established is evidence of numerous historical documents showing a number of Khazars staying in the same towns and cities as people who stayed in Eastern Europe and Russia.\n\nEtnograd (Szkodór), where the Khazars had their own \"state\" (Municipal Council), is located in the south-east of the Carpathian Mountains, just west of the town of Tarnopol in the Black Sea province of Moldavia.\n\nEtnograd is the only site in modern-day Poland and Western Europe where so many documents show that these Khazars were living and working at the time.\n\nIn the historical archives of the Imperial and Royal Court in Kiev, the documents are littered with references to these settlements such as, \"The townspeople of Etnograd reside in towns and villages as well as the city of Kiev, the provincial capital… The Khazars of Etnograd live and work in towns in the region of Etnograd, in which there are also townspeople of other nationalities living….

{"text": "“My response to the film was profound. A documentary cannot answer all of its own questions, but it can address the questions that its maker, and the people who make the film, want to answer. If it is made by a filmmaker, it is the filmmaker who makes the film's questions relevant and useful. I believe this to be true of our art as well.\n\nAt the heart of what filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer wants to make is the question of who, other than the Jews, are responsible for what he calls \"The Holocaust\" (his title of the film). Oppenheimer asks: Who killed the Jews — and others, including \"Christian victims\"? Why are the Germans at fault and who is at fault? Who is responsible for the loss of Jewish life and how many Jews perished? How long before the Nazi era was it Jews who were the primary victims of the Holocaust — at the end of World War II? Where and when did \"the Holocaust\" begin? Who was Hitler? What did the Germans do to deserve their actions in the first place? Why did they get away with their crimes for so long? How were the Jews treated in Nazi Germany and do we know why? What did Jews have to endure? How did they survive? When does the Holocaust end and what's the point of living? Do the Jews have a \"right\" to speak out — did the Nazis have a right to silence them? Does the Holocaust really exist? How would we know? Who controls reality and in whose hands are those who do, in the end, control the stories we tell each other in our stories — are they our parents, our children, our teachers, our children's teachers, the people around us or are they only the artists or writers who tell the stories we tell ourselves?\n\nOpinion\n\nHiroshima Was Necessary for the Enlightenment in a Way That Was Unlikely\n\nJoshua Oppenheimer's powerful documentary The Act of Killing has not received quite the same attention it deserves. On the contrary. Most have been critical in various ways but very few have taken the time to discuss its more substantial contributions to our understanding of the Shoah. In this respect the film had an unusual impact. It did not just make many Jewish people think about the Shoah from the perspective of a particular time period — it made many Jewish people think about the Shoah from the perspective of all time periods. It made the Jewish story of the Shoah relevant to every age and in every culture.\n\nThe Act of Killing has a certain quality that I believe is unique to cinema. It does not merely tell what its makers believe, or who, but it presents its message as if it were a documentary — an aesthetic choice that is both intentional and difficult. In cinema the audience is often supposed to trust the filmmaker because they have taken some degree of responsibility along with the filmmaker. But this makes a lot of sense from a certain perspective. For the viewer it's a question of trust if they are to accept the story told. So a filmmaker with the intent to convince can choose to do this, albeit with a degree of risk. Yet this kind of trust is essential for creating an audience for a documentary.\n\nIn documentaries, both the filmmaker and the audience are forced to make difficult choices — to make choices about who or what to believe. Oppenheimer's film takes risks by its very nature. It's an act of \"making an open act.\" Even that, in and of itself, is a risky choice.\n\nConsider what filmmaker Roman Polanski was convicted of doing in 1977 by an American court. Polanski's decision to make a film about a 12-year-old girl in which he had acted in ways that were thought to be illegal but did not result in any charges; his decision to conceal the existence of the film until after it was completed; his decision regarding what is seen and what is not seen on the film's cover; his decision that he was free to make films; and his decision to film a cameo in the film — all decisions the police considered \"sickening\" and \"indecent\" by many. But in order to get these decisions in the film, and to take the risks Polanski did — risks that were part of the purpose for the film's existence — he needed to convince the audience that he was, in fact, making a film to protect a child.\n\nIn Oppenheimer's documentary The Act of Killing the filmmaker asks what is meant by \"victim.\" When I watched the movie recently I wondered about the definition of victim in a film like this.

It's us.\" There was panic, and so much emotion in the woman's face. Jimmy saw her reaction a hundred times, even in prison. She saw herself looking in horror, and then saw the man she loved, Jimmy, and knew that this can't be real. It is a dream, a nightmare, a nightmare.\n\nIt wasn't real for almost a year. Jimmy's and her brother's parents came out to check, and when they came in they saw that it wasn't their son. There were two sets of footprints in his cage that night, so they knew that it couldn't have been him. The nightmare ended.\n\nJimmy and his brother have been told their whole lives that they were wronged, that they should be grateful for what happened. That they weren't even born with their own mother and father. Her, because they were black in a racist country. The man, because they brought home something that no white person should ever be able to come home with. Jimmy's father was one of the few white men that Jimmy could see for more than two seconds without getting scared, before turning his gaze away. His mother always turned over in her sleep to the baby. That would always be her dream. Her baby.\n\nHe grew up without any concept of race – he knew he had black blood, he knew he would never be considered human, until he became a man and saw the world as he always has. Jimmy knew that he looked like he should, he'd grow up to be pretty handsome. But no one seemed to believe him, that his people were actually being hurt. Jimmy spent a lot of time feeling sorry for himself. This whole world had made him feel inferior. He was a black man, and that meant he had to do what he was told.\n\nThey went back there that day he was told that he needed to pay for his misdeed. It took him a long time to get up the nerve to do it. They found him in his cage and locked him up until he came to his senses. He finally gave up, and came over to Jimmy's house with a gun.\n\nJimmy came to her, as they've long said the two of them stood in the door frame on a hot day in a hot country, before the black man's body had been cremated and the ashes scattered on the ground. They stood there.\n\nHe put something inside her mouth, and she felt this coldness in the back of his throat as she realized he was putting something inside her. She thought about how often he had put something inside her, and how his lips and tongue always seemed to be just right to do it. She thought about how it had not been her fault – not him, not his fault, not her fault. It would not be his fault either.\n\nThe black man had been in prison for 17 years for a crime that had never been a crime, Jimmy remembered thinking, that he had not committed at all. She thought about how often that happened in that prison, and she thought about what went on down there. How many black men had gone and died in there with Jimmy in their cell.\n\nThey knew he was scared – she had been scared, too, but Jimmy, more than anyone, had been hurt by a black man who did not believe he had been wronged. He had been hurt for two reasons, the first had only happened before then, the second only occurred on the day that they met after two and a half years.\n\nJimmy felt like she finally understood his problem, and what it had been that had kept Jimmy from asking for help once it was clear that", "prompt_len": 158, "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": ": Political boundaries of nations, states or regions are no longer the fetters for business in theglobal economic paradigm. For example, one ofthe world's largest multinational companies, McDonald's, has come to accept global regulation of its suppliers based on their level of development. The foodstuff giant has made the shift from a local model of development to a global model, where the global market has become the determining factor in the organization of itsfood system. This globalization has resulted in a massive increase in the output of foodstuffs. To be effective, it is also necessary to shiftfrom a production-based to a consumption based model, an innovation that involves the incorporation of technology. A successful application of technology will result in a reduction in the costs of foodstuffsand therefore in an increase in the consumer demand of these products, as seen inthe introduction of price-control policies for foodstuffs during the 1980s. The global supply offoodstuffs has been transformed through the use of global information systems, such as satellite navigationand electronic trading, forthe transportation and distribution of foodstuffs and raw materials. In addition, the globalisation of the production of foodstuffs is accompanied by a global movement of consumers from developing countries to developed countries withina generation, which has raised the productivity index for commodities. This has resulted in a shift from a subsistence- based economy to a non-agricultural one, resultingin a decrease in the volume of consumption by the population of developingcountries and an increase in that of developed countries. On the other hand, a similar process of development of the consumer economy is occurring in a similar manner in the developedcountries. One of the distinguishing characteristics between these two sets of countries is that of their respectiveeconomic arrangements. Both have the means to import foodstuffs, but they require an enormous amount of money to acquire, because not only arethese countries poor- it is also the countries that have exported the most goods aswell as imported the most foodstuffs.The consumer countries have the means to develop export and import markets. However, they have not only an appetite for exporting but also import markets. Furthermore, this trade has enabled their industrialisation and industrialization of the production of foodstuffs, which in turn has raised the productivity index for all commodities. In addition, the shift of markets from the developing tothe developed countries has taken place through the development of export and import markets based on globalinformation systems for international transportation and trade. It is clear that the globalisation of economic activity leads to the establishmentof trade routes and markets throughout the globe. It is a process that, although irreversible, can be accelerated by the adoption of technological innovation. This processis also characteristic of the \"globalized\" state, because it involves the movement of populations and resources to the countries near the North Atlantic. The economic transformation of the developed societies is characterized by the formationof intercontinental lines of communication. The development of trade routes along the routes taken by the East and the West have opened up the possibility for a large proportion ofthe population to move to and from different regions of the world. These routes are now being dominated by the transnational companies and have thus enabled new regionaland national economic activities to be carried out. Finally, the economic developments of the developed countries create demand for various non-traditional commodities. New demand for these commodities is met by the import of raw materials and intermediate products. While the supply of goods in international markets remains more or less the same relative to the past, the demand for these goods expands because the export markets of those countries that have a surplus of goods are being transformed into an overabundance of goods. It may be inferred that there are two aspects to the \"globalisation\" of economic activity asunderstood by different economic theories. On the one hand, there is a movement in economic activity and, according to other interpretations, a movement of globalisation, which, in any case,has, even without the introduction of computers, been a movement in the direction of technological change,and with this has led to global economic development. The second aspect is an attempt on the part of national governments to manage the economic \"globalisation\" in such a way that its effects on society are minimized. Since the introduction of the free trade zones in the early1990s, the internationalisation of a particular country's economy has been accompanied by increases in the demand for other countries' products. Consequently, trade between developed and developing countries has become a global one, while trade between different countries, even if they share same basicstructure, is still regulated by national systems of governance in most countries. Nevertheless, the free flow of goods across national borders in the global economy has given birth to globalisation and globalization. One of", "prompt_len": 123, "label": "gpt2"}

His father, a famous sculptor of a bygone era, was an early proponent of Celtic culture and mythology, making his son an \"Irish man.\" This is particularly amusing because \"Irish\" is not the same as the Celtic language.\nFrom a young age, Rice was raised, or more precisely, raised by his father in an environment and tradition that was completely alien to, let alone more \"authentic\" than, the Celtic culture he grew up with in Ireland. His father, in fact, wasn't the only European to whom, at one and the same time, he was and wasn't Irish. \nHe was raised in a culture where everything was about \"the Celt.\" Everything was about the \"narratives.\" Everything was about blood. His father was a master sculptor, and his life's work included the largest and most famous Celtic castle in Europe. But what did his culture mean to him?\nThe real \"Irish man\"\nIt meant something completely different. When his father died, Rice went on to become an international authority in archeology and anthropology. But, more tellingly, he learned that, while he had been raised in the \"Celtic\" culture, he had been raised by a countryman, a fellow who was neither \"Celtic\" nor Irish.\nHe had, in fact, been raised, in his words, \"as a white man and as an Irishman.\" And \"as an Irishman\"? What does that mean? And what does that tell us?\nNo, he didn't give a damn. He had been raised like his father, as if in a world that, for more than a decade after the Irish Free State, he had believed, like his father, that his mother, his \"mother,\" was an authentic, Irish woman, a goddess, a real Celtic, a legitimate part of the Irish \"cave painting\" society. \nThis is the thing about the \"cave painting\". They're not Irish. They don't even wear apron. One of them was on TV in the late 1970s, back when \"The Andy Griffith Show\" was on. \nThe fact is, if it hadn't been for an amazing American cousin who, as a teenager, saved his life by dragging his parents to a medical convention, Rice would never have had his chance to become a real \"Irish man.\" \nAnd we're not talking about just one.\nBy the age of 9, Rice was already talking of becoming a soldier, to fight \"the enemy\". \"I want to kill and kill and kill that enemy, and I don't know why,\" he said. After his first year, he was accepted to medical school. He studied at the Hospital of the University of Chicago.\nBut when he was 24, he realized that he didn't want to end up in a hospital. And at 36 he decided it was time to leave Chicago as a graduate student and come back home.\nThis was the kind of thing he had been thinking about since college, when he had had some opportunity to meet some \"cave and rock painters\" from up in Canada. \"I knew they must be different from the white man,\" he later said. \"And I told my wife, and she said, 'Yes, that's it.' She said, 'That's it, and I'm coming with you.'\"\nThey sailed for Ireland, and he worked with Irish artists at the Ballygofen art museum. And in the summer of 1978, they spent three months in the remote mountain village of Rosses Point, where the Irish Celts had lived centuries before they moved from the Irish islands to England, Spain, and other parts of the Iberian peninsula, \"the Celtic cradle,\" and the site of the most important ancient cultural treasures of Northern Europe.\nIt's quite possible that most of Rice's \"exotic\" experiences have been forgotten because he was so immersed in being an Irishman that he made them \"normal.\" \nBut that's exactly what the cave, rock, and pottery symbols are for. It's what they are for.

{"text": "Similarly, Miliband might also note that the public had little faith in Labour’s ability to manage immigration but still voted the party to power in 1964. As a result, the government passed a new British Nationality Act (now known as the 1977 Immigration Act) on May 12, 1986. The act was heavily criticized and many believe that it failed to deal with the scale of the problem or its effects.\n\nIt's worth briefly reminding ourselves how much the 1986 immigration bill improved Britain’s immigration system. The government had previously only allowed certain nationals to qualify for certain professions and it could not recruit skilled workers from outside of Europe. If you were a doctor, you had to be a Brit. But from 1986 onward, skilled immigrants and European family members could qualify. In addition, those who had spent the previous 2 1/2 years living on welfare could also apply for asylum under the 1986 act. The final phase, which started in 1990, extended the period during which a member of the family could be granted refugee status. This last phase ended on December 31, 2011.\n\nThe changes, most of which were carried through by Thatcher, created what has become known as the post-war immigration law, known as the 1981 European Communities Act. The act set to transform Britain’s legal immigration system, to create a more flexible system which allowed companies to recruit from around the world and which allowed for asylum and a wide range of family members. If you were a skilled worker and the family members had arrived between 1986 and 1990, they were granted refugee status and became eligible for family reunion (see Table 1, below). For those in the 1980s and 1990s, immigration was a choice, not an obligation.\n\nSource: Home Office, Historical Statistical Tables, 2015\n\nTable 1: Post-1981 immigration laws\n\n1980s 1989 1990 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Citizenship rights for skilled workers and family members. (a) No restrictions on the ability to enter British territory. (b) Temporary skilled worker system introduced. (c) Temporary residence permission granted for most skilled workers. (d) Temporary entry from outside British territory for most family members. (e) Temporary asylum for family members of certain individuals. (f) Period of residence allowed for family members of some skilled workers who have been admitted to Britain since 1986, who have subsequently left the country in the previous 5 years. (g) Family reunification rules for family members of certain individuals. (h) The introduction of an asylum system for persons who qualify for asylum under the 1981 European Communities Act. (i) The introduction of a family reunion system for families of certain individuals (see point (f) above). (j) New transitional controls in the 1980s. (k) The requirement for applicants to have been registered in the UK for a minimum period prior to obtaining permission to immigrate. (l) Certain categories of skilled workers (see point (m) above). (m) Skilled worker (skill level 4) restrictions. (n) Child and other dependants.\n\nSource: Home Office, Historical Statistical Tables, 2015\n\nSome of the 1986 laws that set the groundwork before 1983 have had their day. But there was a lot of confusion about the system in the 1980s and beyond, especially between 1986 and the mid-1990s, and the impact of the legislation changed many factors, such as family reunion rights of spouses.\n\nIn 2005 a Home Office review of the immigration system concluded that the \"post-1981 immigration system has largely failed to meet people’s expectations. It is an enormous administrative task for employers who are already taking advantage of the skills available to them by taking the best jobs in the labour market. But, at the same time, the system has created huge difficulties for employers who have to navigate it. It has been both a challenge and a source of confusion for employers and for the Home Office staff who administer it.\"\n\nThere are some things that are clear from the data. The proportion of the UK public with no confidence in Labour in 2016’was its highest level since May 2014 when the Conservatives gained their largest victory yet, but before last year's general election with Jeremy Corbyn at the helm. In May 2016, 42% had little or no confidence in the Labour Party to deal with immigration, the second highest such score since 2001. Many respondents felt it was time for a new political party to replace Labour. But a recent opinion poll for The Observer found that 42% had confidence in the party to deal with Brexit within the next year and, according to the poll, 65% of people who voted Labour last year backed Corbyn in his leadership bid, in spite of the fact that Labour leader has been an activist against racism since the", "prompt_len": 154, "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "There is a theory that a truly great film director has to be obstinate and uncompromising to any opinion or advice anyone else on the film set would have, reasonable or not.Think about a director like Stanley Kubrick who was such a perfectionist that infamously required over 100 takes of the same scene.John Huston was another prime example, a man whom most people cited as being very difficult to work with. This is no more true now than it was when he was first developing his style, but what has changed since then is the ability of directors to make their own standards as arbitrary as a dream. It is no longer considered a great director who is willing to play around with his own creative vision. What was considered a great director a couple generations ago is no longer considered a great director at all.It's as if these filmmakers made three distinct generations of creative artists in the 90s. There was the John Cassavetes generation who made films with a strict, minimalistic aesthetic and an uncompromising, uncompromising artistic direction. There was the Robert Altman and Woody Allen generation who made films with a more realistic artistic sensibility. And then there was the Martin Scorsese generation who made films in some instances that were more conventional in their sensibilities, but with a more artistic and stylized quality. These directors and their respective cinematographers took a different path to the mainstream film, and yet they all came out, with varying degrees of success, with films that are some of the best to be seen in their respective years. This is the third generation of film directors making films with a new cinematic approach and an expansive scope. As well, it would appear that this movement was partially driven by the market. Both Cassavetes and Scorsese had found great success with films that seemed far outside of Hollywood's purview, and were certainly accessible to a mainstream American audience. Then, in the 90s, a new sort of film began to be released, films that were far more commercial in their approach, and yet still had a kind of cinematic purity. This was a film movement that is now in its own era, having spawned the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Ang Lee, Robert Altman, and Michael Bay in the 90s, to name a few. The point here is not that directors of older films were necessarily going to be more successful, or just necessarily better at what they did. Rather, rather, the film that has been identified as the beginning of this era was a film director who was able, through sheer hard work and perseverance, to take a more experimental or commercial stance with his films, and have those films become successes while also being considered by the wider film-going public to be art. It's been the first decade of the new millennium, and for many directors, it appears that the 90s film-making movement has finally gone mainstream.", "prompt_len": 409, "label": "gpt2"}

Here is our guide to the city's most charming neighbourhoods.\n\nToronto's Inner Forest – Humber Square\n\nHumber Square is the heart of The Junction, not far from the city's main core and the heart of the Toronto's growing, downtown entertainment district. At Humber Square, you'll find some of Toronto's best restaurants, coffee shops and retail outlets. The square's trees, once lush and vibrant, are now covered in greenery and the plaza sits amid many different retail boutiques and restaurants. The downtown area is about a 10 minute walk uphill or a 20 minute walk along the waterfront to Humber Beach Park.\n\n\nHumber Square in comparison to Humber Beach Park.\n\nYonge and Eglinton in South Oakville\n\nThis is the neighborhood home to Queen's Park and the University of Toronto - Mississauga. It is surrounded by trees and dotted with a variety of shops and pubs. It's a popular destination for city tourists and residents alike, especially on Fridays during the summer.\n\n\nYonge and Eglinton in comparison to Yorkville and East Toronto.\n\nQueen's Quay North, West End and the Don Valley\n\nYou can find this neighbourhood in Scarborough, just north of the Don Valley. It's close to the beach and you can also visit the Scarborough Centre Museum, known nationally as the largest art gallery in the world. But beyond the art, there are also a few notable attractions that are worth visiting including the Ontario International Centre, a former military base now used as commercial and corporate headquarters, and the National War Memorial.\n\nThe area is also home to several of Toronto's best neighbourhood pubs such as B'nai Brith, The Royal Alex's, The Horseshoe, The Humber Yard Pub and the Tops Shop.\n\n\nThe Yorkville and Don Valley areas of Toronto.\n\nToronto's West End and East York\n\nThe two largest neighbourhoods in the city reside in the East and West, respectively. The West end has its very own history of gentrification, but the more recent East end is more of a working class neighbourhood like, you guessed it, Queens Quay North and Queen Street West. Both neighbourhoods are home to trendy eateries and restaurants as well as great parks and public squares.\n\n\nToronto's West End in comparison to East Liberty and the Junction.\n\nEast York is the main destination for residents looking to stay the night. It has a wide variety of boutique accommodation and trendy restaurants and bars like Blue Jays Bay, The Beer Garden, West End Tavern and the new Bar & Grill.

{"text": "Lippmann's position is supported by a host of historical legends: that congressional war hawks, responding to popular jingoism, compelled James Madison to ask for war in 1812, during a period of improving British-American relations; that a spirit of manifest destiny swept James K. Polk along in its wake into the Mexican War of 1846; that expansionist fervor and humanitarian impulses created by an irresponsible yellow press propelled William McKinley into war against hapless Spain in 1898; that myopic popular isolationism restrained Franklin D. Roosevelt's realistic anti-Axis program in the late 1930s; that antiwar protesters humbled the once-omnipotent Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and forced both his withdrawal from public life and his de-escalation of the war in Southeast Asia ; and that the bitter memories of that war made it difficult for presidents to intervene militarily in the Third World during the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nBut the history of American presidential wars seems the most apt starting point for a critique of the contemporary Democratic Party, which offers no challenge of military adventurism. The Democrats have always been the party of the welfare state, so much so that they have long pushed their members to serve in the military in an effort to secure \"the great security\" of being able to provide for their families, not for fighting wars. During the Cold War, the party not only opposed most American intervention, it actively sabotaged such measures as the Strategic Defense Initiative, which it saw as a giveaway to defense contractors. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter launched a disastrous missile and bombing campaign against the pro-Soviet Afghan government led by the mujahedeen commander, Ahmed Shah Massoud, which left a million civilians dead. The following year, Carter also backed a U.N. peacekeeping operation that led to the deaths of as many as a half-million Afghans.\n\nThe Democrats' current embrace of military adventurism has a more familiar source. It is part of a long tradition whereby politicians have been lured into believing a great threat requires their support, no matter how unpalatable the actual consequences may be. It was Lyndon Johnson's mistake in 1962 to make the case that American forces were necessary to ensure security in Vietnam. It was George H. W. Bush's mistake to call for the United States to join the Saudi-led coalition conducting an invasion of Lebanon in retaliation for Iraq's attack on Kuwait in 1990. It was Bill Clinton's mistake to get off script and threaten to \"totally obliterate\" the terrorist network known as al Qaeda in 1998, leading to an intervention in Sudan that destroyed that very network and left over one million dead. And it was Barack Obama's mistake to make the same mistake during his 2008 \"capitulation\" to the war in Afghanistan. By then, nearly a decade at war in that country, the United States had already caused more loss of life in that country than did all of World War II combined, or had seen the American troops killed there as many times as U.S. ground forces had been killed in the entire course of the twentieth-century in other theatres of war, such as Korea during the Korean War or the Vietnam War in the decades after the conflict. In all, there were over twice as many U.S. civilian casualties as were killed there during the entire course of the twentieth century under the U.S. war effort.\n\nSuch mistakes, of course, are not the preserve of a single political party, but to the extent that any historical party has been willing to embrace military adventurism, it was the Democrats long before the rise of Donald Trump in 2016. And today, the party has done so on a grander scale than it had even done in the postwar era. For example, during the last decade, the United States and its allies launched a series of invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and invaded Libya, in addition to the ongoing air war in Syria. Although it is widely assumed that these interventions were conceived with a narrow focus on the \"war on terror,\" in reality, as James Steinberg and other scholars of American politics have pointed out, the focus on these two relatively recent conflicts has distorted U.S. foreign policy. With regard to the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan, Steinberg points out that Clinton's and Obama's arguments for invading Iraq in 2003 centered on the claim that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and was connected to al Qaeda.\n\nBut, when Clinton withdrew from office in early 2009, some of her close advisers began circulating her planned remarks on Afghanistan, which she eventually delivered in the wake of the September 11, 2001–style terrorist attacks that Obama's administration was waging against the Taliban at the time. In June 2009, Clinton gave a speech to a group of retired military officers in which she presented the war in Afghanistan as \"the most extraordinary battle of our times.\" The speech, which was made public for the first time in full this week, drew almost uniformly critical responses from the military leaders of both political", "prompt_len": 951, "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "In northern Italy the Ghibellines, who supported the emperor, were more prominent than the Guelfs, who sided with the pope; but in many cities both parties struggled for power. The most famous of these were Florence and Milan. Florence was a free city in the south-eastern territory of Italy; in the northern half it was the seat of the pope. To the west and south Italy was divided in a line which gave Italy to three groups. Between these the country was bordered by the Danube, which, as the river Ganges, flowed on to the Black Sea, and the Tiber on its side. The eastern and the southern, the Tuscany of the north, and the Latium of the south, were divided into separate electorates. The Pope thus ruled over two very different nations, the Papal State in the northern and the Lombard State in the south-eastern lands. The papal states were a reflection of the times of the Renaissance; an age of scientific inquiry, of modern ideals, when, having the advantage of all others, the Papacy claimed first claim of all modern political authority. And in the Papal States there was a lively tradition of a free press, and a very active commercial life: a life in which there was real liberty. The Papacy claimed to be the true representative of Christ, and the whole Church, because of the great majority of Catholics in Italy, accepted this claim. Under the papal government the rich made free provision for their families by making loans to the Papal State or to other religious establishments. They sent their young men to the universities of Padua and Bologna; they sent their artisans and servants to Florence; they helped in their families, in their marriages, and in the great public works of construction which the Papal States put together with their own resources. The papal states were much poorer than the cities or the counties, and were poor indeed, though the population was not enormous. But the Papal States were free of the corruption which was everywhere a source of scandal for the Italian cities; and their government was a free one, free in the sense that no political leader had been chosen beforehand.\n\nBut the Pope was in danger, too. He had a rival, and he hated him by proxy; but the rivalship was an uneasy one, and had very little real effect. The Pope himself was a stranger to many of the people; they knew little about him and more about his predecessor, and they were not always friendly. There was a strong party of republicans at Padua, who did not like the Pope's politics; they thought that he wanted to subvert the Italian Government, and they blamed him bitterly for his lack of energy and his weakness in making laws. But his chief political supporters were the Jesuits and the Venetians; a great part of his political activity was directed against the great political parties, and there was a fierce hatred for them. These two parties were so powerful that, if they disagreed with the Pope, and if he was willing to take part against them, what he did had the force of fact. The Pope was a real ruler, who could command the military power of Italy. The Pope may well have been a man of iron, but he had great practical ability and personal pride. The people loved him, though he seldom understood how to make them love him the way they did.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century Naples was the centre of political agitation in Italy, just as it was of agitation among the great states of Europe in the 18th century. Naples was the main centre of Italian power, and it had been taken by the Papacy by force, more than a century before. Naples was the center of political intrigue, where the most sinister intrigues took place, political assassinations of emperors, Papal Popes, kings, knights, and great princes were frequent. The Pope was a great favourite, loved by the people, and a powerful instrument of their policy. The Emperor, Frederick William II, hated the Pope and would have cut him down had he not been scared by a few brave words. But the Pope still held Naples, and Frederick William could hold only little Naples. For over two hundred years a powerful power", "prompt_len": 176, "label": "gpt2"}

These treatments are believed to improve the effects of traditional medicines because the plant acts as a vehicle to enhance the delivery of the medication. Researchers believe that the plant is more effective than traditional Chinese medicine methods of preparing herbal medicines.\n\nIn the case of medicine, the traditional herbal approach is used first, followed by mountain laurel. In traditional Chinese medicine, herbs are boiled or chewed and then used as medicines. Traditional medicine practitioners then apply the herb to the skin for pain relief. Researchers believe that the herb effectively prevents the formation of blood clots and thus the formation of blood clots in circulation.\n\nResearchers also believe that since the herb has anti-inflammatory properties, it can make it easier to swallow medication that has to be chewed or squeezed. In traditional Chinese medicine, the dosage of medication for fever is usually adjusted according to body weight and body mass index. In this treatment, the herb is used to help reduce swelling and pain. The herb can also be helpful in the treatment of high blood pressure and heartburn.\n\nResearchers believe that the herb can increase the effectiveness of oral pharmaceutical medications. The herb is applied to a part of the tongue, which causes the medication to be released faster. Mountain laurel is said to have the same effect. Researchers believe that this means that the herb will help reduce or eliminate the side effects of pharmaceutical medicines, as well as be helpful in controlling the duration of drug usage.\n\nResearchers believe that using mountain laurel can prevent and treat the following diseases and conditions: blood clots, heart ailments, ulcers, cancers, diabetes, liver diseases, liver problems, hepatitis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high blood pressure, epilepsy, allergies, obesity, depression, diabetes dyscontrol, cancer.\n\nIn addition, the herb is being investigated for helping in treating diseases that are common in China including osteoarthritis and arthritis.\n\nWith its rich medicinal constituents, the plant may be used to help prevent and treat many of the common ailments that afflict people across the world. Research efforts are ongoing for finding ways to use mountain laurel in a more effective and better way.\n\nReferences:\n\nS.S. Huang, M.C. Huang, L.C. Cheng, et al. (2012).

{"text": "\"My favorite Olympic memories have come from opening ceremonies,\" said Dick Ebersol, the Chairman of NBC Universal Sports & Olympics who is working his seventh Olympics, fifth as executive producer of NBC's coverage. \"Whether that's Beijing in 2008 or Los Angeles in 1984 we've always found a way to capture a magical moment in the history of our sport. I'm hoping the 2014 games will be no different.\"\n\nThe IOC, which formally adopted the 2014 Winter Games in April and selected Beijing as the host city in September, held its first IOC plenary session last week in Kuala Lumpur. The session, in which all 193 members will vote on the games ahead of the final vote in September, saw many of the members expressing a desire for greater control in developing the games. They were in an open vote on the hosting city in November, with the Beijing decision receiving the most votes among the four cities.\n\nHosting the Olympics represents the culmination of a massive undertaking for the host city. China alone had to build 10,000 miles (16,380 kilometers) of infrastructure and invest over $40 billion in this effort. The city of Sochi, one of Russia's three southernmost cities, also has had to overcome political issues and a devastating economic crisis, while the host town of Sochi-Yekaterinburg in the southern Urals suffered a severe power shortage earlier this year.\n\nThe IOC is not yet expected to pick the top three cities for the games. It will instead choose cities in order of the votes they received early on as the favorites to gain the Games.\n\nDespite their history, all three cities are facing many of the same hurdles as those of the United States, which also lost the bid for the summer games in Salt Lake City.\n\nLos Angeles has been waiting to receive money from the government of California for its share of the costs of the city's Olympic development but that is a possibility it would rather not have. It has also been criticized since opening ceremonies in 1984 and the subsequent scandal over drugs at the games that resulted in the arrest of some of the athletes and the admission of others to drug-use facilities on the Olympic Village, which remained open while they were there, after the Games.\n\nAnother concern is public safety in a city where 9 percent of residents are unemployed and poverty is widespread.\n\nIn Beijing, the Olympics were not only a financial success for the city but also an important milestone for China's place in the world. China beat the United States to host the Winter Olympics for the first time in 1908 at Igloo, and have since won every Winter Olympics since. Despite this, there were concerns about corruption and mismanagement that overshadowed the Olympic spirit.\n\nAnd then there is Sochi, which is widely viewed as the worst Winter Games in history. It was plagued with snow, an unseasonable snow fall, an unexpected bout of deadly cholera, and a series of other logistical problems that contributed to an estimated $50 billion in cost overruns.\n\nAnd although the games were in Russia, the country's annexation by neighboring Ukraine in March and subsequent conflict in its border region of Donetsk and Luhansk have added to the economic difficulty surrounding the event. Sochi is home to the 2014 Winter Olympics. The country's mayor, the Olympic organizers, and their foreign partners have spent a fortune developing the games and are now in danger of not receiving a dime.\n\nOne major international television network, Bloomberg, which was scheduled to cover all three winter games in Sochi, announced earlier this week that it was cancelling its coverage and laying off 60 people as it considered how best to cover the Games without resorting to government-funded funding.\n\nThe IOC has been trying to prevent the games becoming political and, in an effort to do that, it has asked the city of Sochi to create a special committee that would include all the local parties and will ensure that all of the funds raised for the event will benefit infrastructure and people who live in the city and have suffered economically.\n\n\"You could say all three cities will be suffering losses as a result of a poor Games, but the IOC sees their role in helping develop the sporting infrastructure in all the cities,\" IOC Vice President Jim Irvine said in November.\n\nIt is also expected the IOC will limit the", "prompt_len": 216, "label": "gpt2"}

Wiginton, president and CEO of the Association, in an interview. \"On the other hand, if we donï¿½t go then our members have to go and see what the state actually does.\"\n\nThe association has been on the forefront of efforts to keep the Constitution in the Constitution since its formation. In 1967 the association filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law granting the governor authority to appoint five members of the Supreme Court. The association was ultimately successful. The Court of Errors and Appeals recognized the association's standing to bring the suit.\n\nAt the time, the group was making significant progress, according to Wiginton. Among its accomplishments: helping prevent passage of a law that would have allowed state troopers to arrest \"illegal aliens,\" a measure that was designed to deal with a shortage of troopers. Other victories included a landmark decision that allowed for a minimum of three full day's notice by an employer of an employee who is fired.\n\nIn the 1970s the group was involved in litigation that sought to prevent state legislatures from adopting provisions that would have prohibited the use of the mails for political purposes. In addition to the legislative challenge, a law passed by North Carolina that made it a crime to discriminate in the practice of medicine (the same law that was challenged in 1973's Loving v.

{"text": "There's no doubt about it: Meryl Streep will be nominated for her 17th Academy Award for her portrayal of Britain's most controversial Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in this otherwise underwhelming biopic.\n\nIt certainly looks like it will do no better than the 2012 Oscar-winner for a biopic on the late Nelson Mandela. The film, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, fared even worse: it went down to a disappointing two Oscars for Charlize Theron for its portrayal of the South African president and left-wing agitator, as well as for the film's failure to be as effective a drama as it was an action flick, due to weak performances by Idris Elba and Michael Fassbender.\n\nThe fact is that I found the best parts of this biopic of a world leader I barely knew – the late leader's two decades as Prime Minister – largely boring and a bit derivative, especially due to what can only be described as the director's fetishisation and overuse of some rather old-fashioned political slogans and imagery.\n\nTo make matters worse, the film itself – directed by Paul Greengrass and co-written with Aaron Sorkin, based on Greengrass's own life story of how he became more and more frustrated with the way that Thatcher was portrayed in film – does a remarkably poor job of bringing Thatcher to life; Sorkin has admitted in interviews that he was never really that confident about the British Iron Lady. She remains, for all she has achieved in her life, largely a non-character, an abstract, almost faceless icon.\n\nThat fact is somewhat undermined, though, by the film's focus on how she handled the Falklands War of 1982. Some aspects of the movie, such as Elba's portrayal of Thatcher as aggressive and arrogant, make me feel positively jaded, not about the PM, but about the idea that a woman would hold some kind of world power (the Queen is portrayed by Judi Dench here, though she is only described as \"the Queen\" one-third of the time).\n\nThatcher as \"Mister President\" goes against everything we learned from her, from her lack of real depth in her later years and her seeming inability to accept people into her own family. Thatcher does not \"love\" the Falklands. She does not even have a \"love\" for the Falklands in the normal sense. She simply wants them, as any military commander (or in this case, politician) would do, to stay, to take it \"because hell, we can't risk our warships in it\". The Thatcher character was made to make this point to the Argentinian PM, Menem, in the only scene I noticed where Elba gives a decent demonstration of acting.\n\nAs a result, I'm not really sure where Elba is going with his portrayal of Thatcher. She's probably a bit more nuanced than many people give her credit for, one of the many attributes that makes Thatcher such a fascinating politician. But ultimately I can't find much of a film here that really makes me cry for the late Prime Minister, or which really \"lights Thatcher up\", in the way that some film critics describe the impact the film had on them when they first saw it.\n\nOf course that doesn't necessarily mean I think this film does not work as the biopic it was supposed to be. As I had hoped it would. But I do wonder whether it doesn't leave Thatcher looking as though a very good actor had done some good work by a very good actor.\n\nThat's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie either: I didn't. But it didn't give me much hope for the work of other biopics. This review was written prior to the announcement of the nominations, so I'm not entirely sure of what to make of it.\n\nGreengrass certainly should have better luck making this one.\n\n(The Daily Mail)\n\nMORE: In honour of 'Madam President' Sorkin, here's a new ad campaign featuring Sorkin and Mel Gibson\n\nMORE: This is how Sorkin got Mel Gibson to play Thatcher", "prompt_len": 209, "label": "gpt2"}

It is not known why Norma Jeane left the US and went to Trinidad (the Caribbean was not in the South, but it is known to have been common there, so it is not unlikely).\n\nAnd, of course, without the marriage certificate, we can't know whether Marilyn and Norma Jeane met before she moved to Florida, although she does tell me she was 16.\n\nAs I drive around St Martin, there are many homes with US military bases and planes flying at the nearby airport.\n\nIn the streets, people have built American flags and patriotic signs. One of the houses I drive past, on the seafront, is adorned with a huge American flag. It has a sign outside it saying: \"Welcome to our home.\"\n\nThere is only one home in St Martin that I visit that bears Marilyn's name: one of three houses in a house called Marie's.\n\n\"Marilyn was born here, as this house,\" says Bernard Marie, the property's builder.\n\nHis father was a dentist and his mother was an American. His wife is a housewife who lives next door. Bernard says their three children were all born in a day, and it didn't seem particularly strange.\n\n\"As soon as the baby was born she knew right away she was born here, because she knows our country and this country and, she says, that she has been a long time in this country... She loves the US and America,\" he says.\n\nMarilyn's mother left at 14 when Bernard was still a child. His father died when he was young. A former landlord, Bernard's father never married or had children, but did a lot of travelling, having lived in Jamaica, Trinidad, the Bahamas.\n\nWhen I go to visit the house, Marie sits at the kitchen table, telling me she has been working in the US, making clothing for the US army, \"and I love my children and my family\".\n\n\nMarie explains that she met Marilyn in her 20s or 30s, working in Florida.\n\n\"She was in the army helping to send people back, for some reason she was sending soldiers back to the war, so she was living in the army camp... It may or may not be true that she stayed with him for awhile, but I didn't see that. If we were going anywhere I saw her every day.\"\n\nShe doesn't talk much about Marilyn, except to confirm she never worked for the US military.\n\nMarilyn's sister, Sandra Jackson, has lived in St Martin since she was a teenager, and says she met Marilyn in college in Fort Lauderdale. Her family, and those in the area, don't know the full story, but Jackson still remembers it being something of a scandal back then in St Martin.\n\n\"She was really popular. My sister was like eight when she met Marilyn. She was the same age as her sister, like 8. They would meet at the beach. One girl from town got pregnant.\"\n\nJackson says she only met Marilyn a year or two later -- she was working as a nurse in New Orleans, then on a cruise ship. She had met Marilyn's family once before at an American Baptist church in St Martin.\n\nWhile Jackson says she only thinks about the \"good things\" about Marilyn, about the family she lost, she does seem to recall her fondness for the US.\n\n\"For me, I think the best thing in the world is the freedom to travel... It's not that I am an American, I'm a Caribbean and I love the US because that's my motherland...\"\n\nShe's always spoken in Caribbean-sounding French. On this, a trip to see her in St Martin, she says: \"Do you know how good my life here is?\"\n\n'The other side...'\n\nSo, here's where it comes down to one big question: are Marie's and Marilyn's stories true? That is, can we trust them?\n\n", "prompt_len": 78, "label": "gpt2"}

It is the largest of all the stars, dwarfing the rest of the stellar group by half within a span of forty-three degrees. It is formed of one thousand twelve hundred and forty seven stars, one hundred and twenty of which are also called Ursae Minoris in Latin. Most of these stars form part of the 'Great Bear', and the number of Ursae Minoris is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the star (i.e. the nearer it is to us, the fewer its number). A very tiny fraction of stars form a cluster together, the Ursa Major Cluster (the blueish-brown nebula to the lower right of the top image).\n\nThis large cluster is formed of about fifty stars, but is the most luminous group of stars known. Some three thousand are known to be part of this cluster. This cluster is also visible from almost everywhere on earth, although the best times for observing it are in the winter, as it contains the brightest, hot stars (up to eight or nine thousand degrees in brightness) and tends to become more 'visible' in the Southern Hemisphere when the Sun rises higher.\n\nThe constellation can be seen near the autumn equinoxes, even in the winter, although the constellation may appear further north if you have north-facing windows, in that case a long exposure in dark conditions is likely to be needed. This constellation is so large that if two images are taken with a mirror at a distance of 10cm (the diameter of a human hair) of one of these stars it will actually be visible in the other image. In fact, this object is one of the stars of the Milky Way (the giant spiral galaxy). So far this cluster has only five stars visible with the naked eye - so it is not very well photographed.

Like Patterdale's dogs, Pariahs can show good hunting skills with their high prey-catching ability and good ability to take care of their owners. While they love playing together with Patterdale's dogs, Pariahs tend to be territorial and jealous. If one was to do business with one and one got a leash on it, it is likely that the dog would become fearful and run away before it gets to play.\n\nWhile Pariahs are often known for their friendly and playful disposition towards humans, they are also known to show aggression towards certain humans, usually males. Male Pariahs are often the dominant ones and, as such, should they get mad at another, it is not recommended to get between a pair of animals. It's often said that a strong bond between a male and his dog prevents aggression between them. It is usually also warned that if the bond gets too close, the male will often show signs of aggression including growling and displaying other physical reactions such as snapping and bite marks on their own.\n\nPariahs are sometimes classified as Border collie, though the Breed Standard of the English Pariah Dogs' Association says clearly they are a different dog of their own nature. Even for those who have never owned one of them, it is very apparent that the breed possesses a strong and imposing presence. This is perhaps one of the main traits that make Pariahs so well suited for the military.\n\nAs with other military breeds, Pariahs are known to have a short life span.

Even now, after the passing of his family's great-grandfather, Peter, who had been shot down at the Battle of Hastings and died at the battle of Bosworth in 1546, Mr. Edwards does not find the names of his immediate ancestors in the muster rolls or in surviving registers, or perhaps he thinks that since I am not his biological descendant, I also have no ancestors, which of course would be an impossible supposition. I also have no record of the names of either of my grandparents who died prior to the Civil War. Mr. Edwards's own brother, George, died about 1839, and my mother is presumed to be the only maternal grandparent living. To find out one's genealogy is an invaluable adventure. But being of an academic rather than a scientific bent, Mr. Edwards has been unable to locate his ancestors on either side of the battle where their sons fought. For his own curiosity his ancestors had to be found on some other, even more distant, battlefields: namely, the frontiers of Scotland. (According to history, England was always the centre of British politics, especially since Edmund the Confessor founded the government of the land of the West Saxons in the time of the late Anglo-Saxon kings of Wessex and Mercia. This English government extended its power in what later came to be called the \"West Highlands\".) Mr. Edwards learned the name of his father-in-law's forebears, and even his grandfather, in a little book of genealogies by Robert Burley. Though Burley's book of \"ancestor registers\", as he called them, was published in 1791, Burley is not widely regarded as one of the best genealogists of his time: indeed, some have been critical of Burley in order to give credit where credit was due to someone else. However, it was he who was the first to offer a genealogy of this kind, and whose books have had a great impact; Burley was also an English professor at the University of Cambridge at the time, where many of his genealogies have been published. A few of Mr. Edwards's genealogies are listed in the book of Genealogies, Vol. 1, published in 1896, of which the fol- lowing collection is a collection of about 100 genealogies, organized by name or surname. The names collected for this collection are those found in the Burley-Burling collection, Volumes 1 to 4, for which his permission was sought. These genealogies are to be found in all editions of Volume 1. \"Edwards\" is the middle name of both \"Milton\" and \"Cayley\"; \"Ruffridge\" is the middle name of R.D. Burling's father, \"Cayley\" is Mr. Burley's own name. \"Cox\" is the middle name of R.D. Burling's father, D.C. Cox, and \"Henderson\" is the son of John Henderson of Dunbar. See also the pages for Mr. Burley, Vol. 5. I am grateful to T. R. Brown, of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, for preparing these genealogies which, like Mr. Burley's, were published in the Oxford University Press genealogical workbooks of 1853 and 1854. These genealogies have been revised by Ms. J. E. B. Rucksteegh, from her genealogical research in the Bodleian library library.

He became a national hero with the introduction of Match Of The Day in 1978 and, following the death of Ian Wright in 1988, the role of BBC television sports journalist and broadcaster acquired a significant new dimension.\n\nA passionate advocate for Britain's sporting traditions and for the preservation of northern culture (where he was born and grew up), Wilson's passion was born from a strong sporting gene. This, he argued, ran as deep as the sport itself, and was rooted in the way that most northern people thought about life.\n\nThe sense of identity that his sports passion engendered, he wrote in a new book,'says it is our own and will not permit the intrusion of anything foreign … It is about as far from the sentimental culture of the English north as you can get – in fact it is quite another culture and will not take kindly to anybody who tries to put down its ways or impose its values.'\n\nWilson had a passion not only for sport but for living in the north. This was expressed when he described himself as a 'northern soul'.\n\n'The idea of being British, of Britain, of Britain has never been to try to escape the cold and wet of this region. It is not a comfortable idea for northerners to have in the south – but it is central to our identity,' said Wilson. 'I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with my home. The fact is, I was born on the Isle of Mull, the most southern place to be born. And I have been an island boy every since.'\n\nI love north but hate football – I'm an English country boy but a northern one, I think.\n\nBorn on Christmas Day 1956, Wilson was the grandson of soldiers who had fought in World War II, and had two older brothers who had served in the Royal Marines.\n\nIn a rare interview with Sport magazine in 1980, he recalled: 'We're half English. That's the story of my life. I was a big fan of George Best's, Bobby Moore's and Jim McKay's. And I used to have my English football shirt cut out and hang it on the wall. After every game I'd look it out. I used to have a cupboard full of them. My father didn't play at all, but he would have come in and I'd play a game of football with him and then go down the tunnel to watch the game in the dressing-room.'\n\nWilson attended Dewsbury Grammar School, where he was a popular presence on the football pitch, captaining the school's side to Division One victory in the 1970s.\n\n'I loved watching the game of rugby, so played first team rugby when I was 10 years old,' said Wilson. 'And when I moved to Dewsbury in 1972 I had a lot of friends going out of town. But we always spent the summer in the city. Dewsbury had two rugby teams. My parents were rugby fans.\n\n'Dewsbury had all kinds of sports groups. I used to enjoy going to their big social gatherings. They were a popular part of Dewsbury in the 1970s and 1980s.'\n\nDewsbury and nearby Loughborough are two of England's two largest towns. They are both relatively isolated from one another and offer little in the way of urban stimulation.\n\nIn August 1978, the BBC decided to introduce its first ever live television sports commentary from the north and Wilson was brought in to fill the role. He was immediately made manager of Match Of The Day but this role was quickly lost as his broadcasting duties became more and more important. By the end of 1980, his show was broadcast at 4.40pm from London, while he drove around the country, and in January this year, he became the first sporting figure to speak at the opening of the UK's Olympic swimming pools.\n\nAlthough he was a familiar presence on BBC television, his fame as a broadcaster was largely restricted to television but there was another outlet through which his broadcasting life could be enjoyed. Wilson's involvement in the charity and football community meant that although he missed football when it happened, he always returned for the cup games.\n\n'I'm an English country boy but a northern one, I think,' said Wilson with conviction when I met him in a pub in Dewsbury on the morning of Saturday 1 October.\n\n'I was born in the Isle of Mull so I am a northern country boy. And I've been a football fan my whole life.", "prompt_len": 305, "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "The success of the work led to Hergé producing further Adventures of Tintin, starting with the controversial Tintin in the Congo (1930–31), as well as beginning a new comic series, entitled Quick and Flupke . This lasted for over four years. For this book Hergé had Tintin travel at the request of the Belgian Congo government, investigating a strange murder. He returned to the United Kingdom to be in turn hunted by a villain called the Captain, who had been sent by the king of the Congo to find and bring back Tintin for his son. He began to take a greater interest on Hergé's life. It was here, after a lengthy period writing and drawing comic strips, that he had his first children's book, A Father's Work. This, and other more serious books, took him to a new level of maturity. It was soon time for Tintin and the Snowman to come back to England, but it wasn't until the 1940s that he returned to the United States and made a new beginning.\n\nTiptree's Family Tree\n\nIt seems that, along with the beginnings of The Snowman (1920), Tintin was Hergé's most important work until he was forced to retire from the comics world due to age. In The Snowman (1920–21) the French adventurer and former pirate is now in the Congo, exploring the many wonders found on the tropical island. He joins forces with a friend of his called the White Tiger, who helps him investigate a plot to kidnap young Europeans from the Congo. They travel to a cave on the coast called Smilodon, and escape together before the cave comes collapsing. They discover a magic mirror that allows them to travel through time and see the future. Tintin and the Tiger set off in an attempt to save the young Europeans. But they soon notice the White Tiger has something to do with the kidnapping, as one of the men they have freed, and he tells a tall tale to get himself home safe. But time flows differently when you're a Tintin. The Snowman ends at this point, since the rest of the story doesn't make it to publication.\n\nAlthough Tintin was the first of Hergé's children's books to be published, Hergé had had some serious time to reflect on things since his previous two books were also his most successful. They certainly have been to a certain degree, but they certainly were not the major drivers behind the popularity of Tintin and his pals. In Tiptree's Family Tree (1945), Hergé explored the different family backgrounds of Tintin, Snowman's father, a former explorer, and his mother, a housekeeper. Despite the similarities in background, these heroes have completely divergent personalities. Both Tintin and Snowman have the same intelligence, but Snowman's is far more analytical and his natural leadership is a lot more than Tintin's. Their childhoods differ, and although both are still children when they join the adventures, Tintin's is happier and more normal. And although both are the sons of famous explorers, they have their own distinct styles of leadership. For some reason, Hergé felt his own Tintin and his brother's Snowman had much to learn in such matters as how to be a leader. Hergé hoped that his characters would reflect that kind of leadership to the readers.\n\nEven while he was still drawing the original story, Tintin has learned more and more about life. He begins to question the very nature of the adventures that are leading him. In the end, he asks the man he thought was his rescuer what he is doing, and he doesn't get an answer. For his part, the rescuer tells him he is still in danger and to go back home, because he will die if he doesn't find him, and he is. Tintin's mother becomes more and more concerned about him, and tries to help him understand, for him, that he has to put his life first.\n\nHergé's work continued for years after the publication of his first two books. In the 1950s he finally published The Snowman and Tiptree's Family Tree two, three, four times. And the success of the Snowman and Tiptree's Family Tree led to more work, as he adapted this new series to a new age. The main story is still in the middle of its adventure, but Hergé began to explore some of the more serious topics. It is here that the themes of nationalism, nationalism and anti-Semitism begin to appear in the new story.\n\nIn the new story it was discovered that Snowman's father, a former admiral, had actually been a Nazi agent.

{"text": "One of America's greatest          photographers , Ansel Easton Adams is best known for his black and          white landscape photographs of the American West and specifically, the Yosemite National Park. He shot these landscapes on a camera with a shutter speed of only 1/10th a second and an aperture of f/22. His photographs feature dramatic shadows and often showcase amazing detail in snow, water and rock formations, all while shooting subjects that may not even be there at the time of the photo.\n\nIn his book \"Sighting the Western Hemisphere Through Saguaro Rock,\" Adams described his feelings upon photographing these amazing landscapes:\n\n\"I had been in the West from the moment I saw the first canyon walls and canyons with the sharp, clean lines that I could count the years of their existence in. I felt that I was going to find something new in every one of those hills—that I would find a new and beautiful beauty in the unspoiled wilderness, and that the beauty would be mine as well.\n\nThe Saguaro is an important part of the American landscape. I knew I wanted to capture it from above and behind, and in order to do that I needed a camera with a long shutter speed. I knew that if I used an aperture smaller than that of the lens then the camera lens would become so fainter that it would be quite difficult to photograph it. And I knew that because of that, a slower shutter speed, which you could achieve by using a faster lens, would be more difficult to use. I had some experience of shooting at shorter durations than 1/10th a second and I knew that with that, I could bring out all the finer and more subtle details of what is really a very flat, angular landscape. The result was a landscape that I felt was very interesting and new.\"\n\nAt least three versions of this camera were made before Adams died on December 23, 1935. The two most commonly available versions were the Canon SLR camera from which the pictures above were taken and the Bolex from which the photos below are taken. The Canon was a very sturdy camera that could take advantage of the SLR's improved lens and it featured more light-gathering optics than the Bolex.\n\nHowever, Adams was very unhappy with the SLR camera and in the process of experimenting with different lenses, Adams tried using the Bolex as well. Adams felt that the Bolex was a better camera and one in which he could photograph the Saguaro with more quality. In addition, he felt the Bolex's aperture (f/8) was better than that on the SLR, something that photographers of the later part of the 20th Century have pointed out since it was made only in 1925.\n\nWhile the Canon and Bolex seem very similar, there are subtle differences that make it obvious that one camera is a true ancestor of the other.

Henri Morais d'Arquitectes was an architect and a sculptor. Pierre Augustin Thon, by contrast, was a successful architect of industrial design.\nSo, just how did Henri Morais get his work featured so prominently?   We need look no farther than the work of his brother, Jean Morais, as you may have heard of him.\nThe \"Wishing Well\" at Versailles - What Did Pierre Augustin Thon Think of the Design?\nIn 1839, Jean Morais, the younger brother to Henri, started the work on what would eventually become the Eiffel Tower, the Palais Royal and the Chateau de Versailles in Paris.\nIn fact, Jean Morais' work had long been in the works, as evidenced by the fact that he had been hired to design the Eiffel Tower in 1836 by the famous businessman and publicist Charles-Édouard-Léon Fouquet, as well as, later on, the Palais Royal.\nBefore he became the owner of the house at Versailles, Louis X visited France in the early part of the 19th century and ordered the demolition of the older structures at Versailles. However, he changed his mind just a few months later and allowed the construction construction to continue in spite of the fact that many buildings, such as the Chateau de Versailles, had been destroyed.\nAlthough it is still a subject of \"confusion\", even today, many believe that the main reason of the decision of Louis X in this matter lies in the fact that Louis XIV was not fond of old houses such as that of Versailles, and, in fact, would rather have the gardens at Versailles \"exposed\" than have them preserved. That is also the reason why the works of Henri Morais and Thon would become so visible on the walls of Versailles.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Palace of Versailles was designed by Pierre Augustin Thon, an architect based in London in England.\nAccording to historian H. G. Boulton, Thon had little to do with the interior design of Versailles, or with the work of Louis XIV.\nDuring his lifetime, Thon was considered the most distinguished architect of his time and was the first to produce a master plan for the French capital, a work that was made necessary by Louis IX. In 1820, when Thon began designing for the government, he was given a position in the Château de Versailles.\nBut there were other architects in Paris who at first supported Thon, and they even helped him out financially. One such architect was Auguste-Joseph Boulenger.\nA former professor of architecture at the University of Liège, who was renowned for his decorative style, Boulenger came up with a number of designs for the Château d'Étang.\nIn 1824, Boulenger, a French national who had settled in Egypt, came to Paris as an architect and worked for Louis Thon for about five years.\nAs time passed, and Louis' son Louis-Auguste became president of France, Thon's support for Boulenger turned into strong hatred.

In the story below we tell the story from this photo.\n\n\"A Historic New Orleans House - The Normans' House, NOLA\"\n\nby Ed Niebuhr\n\nThe Normans were a prominent Louisiana family of business people, political leaders, merchants, farmers and lawyers who flourished in New Orleans. The oldest son of the family, Norman Loudon (1766-1836), became a prominent lawyer in New Orleans and a member of the Jefferson Parish court. Normans owned large holdings and extensive plantations in East Feliciana Parish and served as a mayor of Feliciana Parish during the French and Indian War.\n\nA few years after the treaty of Rapides-Coulange, a family reunion was held at Lafayette Park in the heart of New Orleans, attended by representatives from all the parishes. The Normans met in the New Orleans City Court of Appeals where their descendants were represented by the Loudon Family Trust. The Normans were members of the Catholic Church, and served in the Church in various capacities and in the office of Mayor of New Orleans.\n\nOn May 21, 1821 (one year after the conclusion of the French and Indian War), President Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States, declared war against Spain, France and Portugal. Norman Loudon, was appointed by President Jackson to the board of trustees of the Orleans Parish Bank. Norman was born January 3, 1766 in New Iberia, Louisiana. Norman was the only son of Abraham Loudon, one of the original twelve children of Abigail and John Loudon. John Loudon moved his family from New Iberia to New Orleans with Abraham, and later was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1825-1901.\n\nNorman Loudon's family included six sons and four daughters, who all lived in New Orleans. Abraham and his four surviving sons moved to New Orleans about six years before the French and Indian War, and died there. The four surviving daughters were married to New Orleans citizens: Edna Mary Ries, Mary Emma Ries, Alice Ann Ries, and Lucretia Mary Ries. The youngest of the family was Alice Ann Loudon to Robert Loudon and Nancy Loudon, who were in the United States Navy. All five sons were lawyers. Normans owned large tracts of land in East Feliciana Parish and Orleans Parish, which served them as a source of income during the French and Indian War, when all legal avenues had to be explored through the French and Indian War. During the war, the Loudons sold many of their land lots to the families of troops so that they could have land to practice farming.\n\nThe Loudons opened their New Iberia office to the public on July 11, 1803. They owned a large business known as the Great Eastern Iron Company, which provided services such as fencing, hammering, and sawing.\n\nThe Old-time French Quarter of New Orleans has remained unchanged since the French and Indian War, except for one significant change. Many of the old French houses have been replaced by new houses with larger windows and tin roofs.

{"text": "\"In this figure there are  variations in the temperature field that are not present in the carbon  dioxide field. The first-order corrections to the carbon  (de)oxygen spectrum indicate that the CO 2  field is not stable at these energies, but rather oscillates with the first-order corrections to the CO  (de)oxygen spectrum. (Taken from J.L. Moseley's discussion of the spectra.) \n[Note that the energy ranges for the CO  (de)oxygen spectrum and the CO   field have the same maximum energy: about 2.8x1022. Thus, if you don't like the \"fixed point\" idea, you need to get rid of the CO  (de)oxygen spectrum completely!] We see that the non-bundled CO  (de)oxygen and the energy scale-invariant CO (de)oxygen spectrum are not in equilibrium in these data. If not, then we can easily get a spectrum that is also non-uniform in the energies. \nIf you want to see another non-equilibrium spectrum, let's look again at a data set called CO-6/2.5 where we have a time-domain representation of 2.5 Gb or 2.5 x 1022 atoms of CO (de)oxygen in a 2.5 x 1022 m3 container. This shows us a very non-steady spectrum in the 0-5.5 cm range, although the time domain shows a bit more detail.\n[As an illustration, here is another very non-equilibrium CO   spectrum for the same data set.] Here is another in an \"equilibrium\" time domain spectrum using the same data set. Both are about 0.5 cms wide and roughly 5.2 cm wide. They also show a similar spectrum width and energy scale:\n[Note that there is a lot of CO   at a very fixed energy. As mentioned above, this corresponds to a maximum of about 5.2 Gb of carbon in a 2.5 x 1022 m3 container. So an atmosphere with CO  at only 4.1 Gb or a slightly higher amount is possible.]\n[Here is a very non-equilibrium time domain spectrum for the same data set. There is a fairly consistent spectrum in this 5.2 x 1022 m3 container.]\n[Note again that these spectra are about one order of magnitude wider than normal, and one order of magnitude more energy concentrated than the normal spectrum. That means there can be an earth-normal atmosphere of at least 4.1 Gb of carbon at a fixed point of about 7.8 X 1025 cm. In short, the \"fixed point\" idea is highly speculative and requires more data to prove.]\nAt present, these results do not allow us to say for sure that the CO  (de)oxygen and CO  field is non-unstable between energy scales. They would need to be confirmed by analyzing a much wider range of data. For example, as described above, there is a strong signal at the low end for CO  (de)oxygen in the CCD data set that shows an average CO   density of 0.4.\n[From the above, one could argue that the non-equilibrium spectrum must be just the standard spectrum for carbon. But as a reviewer pointed out to me, it is also the case that the standard spectrum for carbon is non-uniform. That means that many carbon molecules have to be in the CCD spectrum for CCD resolution to become useful, but at the same time many oxygen molecules are not seen. The CCD has a relatively higher absorption for CO than other wavelengths for carbon. Thus, the spectrum may give a spectrum that is not standard for CO.]\nWe can now review the arguments from various people who are trying to argue that the universe must have a CO  and CO  field in equilibrium.\nArgument from \"Standard of Beauty\" : The standard of beauty for nature's creation is a CO  (de)oxygen  and a CO  (de)oxygen in equilibrium.\n(1) The CO  (de)oxygen and CO  (de)oxygen fields are the \"standard\" universe.\n(2) Therefore, because of the CO  (de)oxygen  and CO  (de)oxygen fields, there must be an additional field, i.e. carbon. It has to be the CO  (de)oxygen  and carbon field.\nThis is quite a standard argument and an easy one to refute.

He put all the armed men into a mass jail set up in the city's main square called Villa Militar. Santa Anna's tactics provoked enormous popular support among the Mexican people, who began to believe he was protecting them from an impending invasion.\n\nSanta Anna's supporters believed that by having so many armed men in the area, one could expect to receive a swift response.

As news of Santa Anna's increasing power appeared in the North American press, there were protests and cries for more aid.\n\nIn response to these protests, President Martin Van Buren of the United States requested a declaration of war from the United States Congress. On December 22, 1833, Santa Anna began negotiations with the United States government. By January 18, 1834, the United States had granted Mexico two loans – worth about $1.2 million.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution had begun!\n\nThe United States Congress finally passed the Mexico City Resolution on March 18, 1834, declaring war against Mexico.\n\nThe United States Congress refused to arm the Mexico Military Department, believing that this was a sovereign nation and must be able to decide their own future.\n\nIn April 1834, the United States Congress issued a call for volunteer volunteers, but only 30 men signed up, most of whom were in Colorado. This angered both Mexico and the United States and led to several weeks of diplomatic wrangling.\n\nBy late April of 1834, Congress decided to arm Mexico and sent some 20,000 armed men to Mexico City. This small force, which consisted of the army, navy, and militia, invaded Mexico City on March 3, 1835 in the Battle of the Golden Stairs.\n\nThe United States and Mexican War\n\nMexico, with little support, lost the war. The United States lost more than 3,000 men, one-third of the U.S. Army. Mexican political leaders had no idea of the defeat and immediately agreed to peace with the United States in March of 1836. They had hoped to secure the American Southwest for American settlers by gaining more land through wars against the native tribes of Nevada, Colorado, and California.\n\nThe result of this decision to break their country in two would be a bitter defeat for Mexico and the beginning of the United States as an independent nation.\n\nIn the Treaty of Paris, signed by U.S. President Andrew Jackson in 1846, both countries ceded their claims of the disputed territories to each other.\n\nIn the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on May 9, 1848, Mexico ceded the Rio Grande, the Pecos River, and most of Arizona to the United States.\n\nIn 1849, after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Congress banned slavery in the new nation. By 1860, most of the Southern states had seceded from the Union, and the Union fell in an armed rebellion.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln proclaimed the \"Emancipation Proclamation\" on January 1, 1863, freeing all of the slaves in the Confederate States of America. This action came after the Southern states refused to recognize the Union as a legitimate government. On April 9, 1862, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his forces and the war ended.\n\nLincoln won the election in 1860, and in the end the United States did gain more freedom for its citizens than any other country on", "prompt_len": 86, "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "It seems these days I am reading about a wrestler or some celeb that I grew up watching either during my  grade school years or college years passing on. I could never quite understand their passing until I was able to go back and dig out copies of the magazine I used to buy him or buy the DVD or DVD box set. It seems the amount of time and money needed to get the content was so high that it never made much sense. We've all heard the old adage \"It doesn't just happen to the good ones\". Most of the time in this world, it just \"did\". It was a great part of life.\n\nAs I stated earlier, it didn't just \"just happen\" to John Cena, it was a job. The job of being on the road to superstardom is something each wrestler has to go through and work hard to get. In order to get the job, the people must like the wrestler, the fans must like the wrestler. A lot of wrestlers have become rich off the job. In some of the cases it's not even a job anymore, they are \"rich\" off of the product they create while on the job. They take their work seriously and want to get as much as they can off it. It's very much a business and every worker is being taken care of that keeps the wheels of the business turning.\n\nIn the case of Steve Austin, his paydays were not coming in until his very late 20's. There did come a time at Austin's retirement where he took a pay cut and even took a few extra months off to recover from injuries during the late 2000′s. In the years since, that pay cut has been rescinded (though it seems no action has been taken against WWE in regards to the issue of his pay) and the majority of his pay comes during the off-season when WWE tends to give most of it out. So the story starts at the bottom, where Steve Austin was paid peanuts during his time in the WWE. Now as a fan it kind of bugs me when fans see that Cena and some other wrestlers get their asses handed to them. I got to say, it's pretty insulting to see these wrestlers make thousands and millions and make their living off of other people's hard work during their final years of active work.\n\nThat leads us to the next part of this post. I'll be talking in-depth about the business and why Steve Austin's legacy should be seen as much larger than he is. There are a lot of \"pessimists\" that believe if WWE didn't allow him a pay cut and treated him like he was an independent contractor with no real responsibilities, Steve Austin would never have had as much success as he did in WWE. It's a fallacy to believe that. The reason he became what he did is because of the business that the WWE built. They gave him the time to reach the level he reached and in order to keep fans interested, he needed a stable of characters that he could relate to while promoting the WWE brand. It wasn't until mid-2006 that the WWE would allow him to be \"John Cena's sidekick\". In order to really understand how much trouble he was in, you would need to be a fan of his career in-between his final years in WWE. For me, the time it took to get the job done for Steve Austin is too damn long. A wrestler or entertainer with the right amount of talent and talent management knowledge could have gone off and been successful for themselves and a lot of others before this job interview incident in 2006. So what are the facts of the matter?\n\nSo Steve Austin got the job, he wrestled the very top guys in the world and wrestled other top guys in the world. He also worked with a variety of stars from other organizations/comics as well as just being a regular guy that wrestled all different people. How many people are there in WWE today that that would have that level of exposure? If he had been offered another job, which is more realistic, that level of exposure and the amount he would have made were not offered, will Steve end up having the level of success now he has?\n\nThe question that still remains is what were the reasons the WWE wouldn't give him a raise? Were they going to keep him and take the easy route and keep him making a lot of money while it was easy to go off and make a lot of money if you wanted to? Was it the fact that WWE wasn't really thinking about the long-term picture at that point? Was it that Steve Austin was never given enough credit or did he turn out to be too good for the WWE?\n\nIf someone was to ask me what I think Steve Austin \"succeeded\" on, I don't doubt that", "prompt_len": 153, "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "Why, one might ask, did Swift have such a consuming contempt for the Whigs? She herself seems to disagree: it was they who put democracy into play without any understanding what democratic governance really is, who thought that a constitution needed a parliament, and who thought of themselves as guardians of the constitution. That is why her first two books, We Are the Champions and Redeemer, are quite good. That is why I believe Swift was never part of the Tory party after the 1830s, and why I don't think she was ever a Tory. In fact, she was a great deal better known in the Whig camp than in the Tory camp. What does that say about the Tory party that their greatest intellectual and most famous poet thought the Whigs were a bunch of buffoons?\n\nThat brings us to Shakespeare and his place in the story of British intellectual life. A lot of people have made the point that it was Shakespeare, one of many brilliant writers and thinkers, who brought English politics to its apogee in the mid-16th century, when most of Europe was still playing catch-up with him. There is something to that, but I also think it is true as something else. The moment when English politics reached its apogee was not the 1710s or 1720s. It was in the late 1490s, when Shakespeare was writing his plays, and it was quite a different situation, where Shakespeare was being written into the politics of his age, and where political change was already underway and at its beginnings. When Shakespeare was writing, the British were still a colony; the English were still in their feudal form of government and still ruled by their archbishop; the English were still ruled by monarchy and still ruled by the church. The country was still one of the world's leading power states; the people were still deeply rooted in their culture; the language was very different from the one that later English speakers were using, and there was a lot of pressure for the culture to be changed in many ways, and the British people were quite keen to do so. When Shakespeare wrote his plays, there were many, many, many political and cultural changes. There is the famous incident in Henry VI, where the man accused of raping Shakespeare's niece gets convicted, and the king is so angry. \"What, now, we are like the Romans who would set themselves up as a throne,\" he says. \"God forbid that we should have such things as monarchy!\" But, I think, if you look at his plays, you find that political changes in those days were still in progress, and there were still pressures, not just from the church, but from the people, for political change to occur.\n\nOne of the striking things to me in reading his plays is how different the political situation was in Shakespeare's time from what it is in our own time. He is not a very partisan writer, but his political thinking, the political positions that he takes in his plays, are quite sharply different from the ones that most people hold today. You know, we have the people who say, for example, that democracy is wonderful, but it does not do anything. \"Nuff said!\" Shakespeare writes. Well, let me ask you a question: do you know what democracy does not do? It doesn't do anything. It will do nothing, because it is simply a political fiction, and you cannot govern anything from the top down. You can go to the street and find very diverse ideas about how the world ought to work, and if you ask the people about their policies, you will almost certainly get a range of ideas. Even when he is attacking the monarchy in Henry VI, that is an example of a political fiction. Yes, when Shakespeare wrote those plays, there were many, many, many changes. I think it is important to bear this distinction in mind, not just in general terms, but in relation to one particular actor, Shakespeare.\n\nIn fact, I think if one looks very closely at the nature of the British state in the 1670s, in the late 1490s, then in his time, when Shakespeare wrote his plays, he was describing a rather different form of society in which a number of individuals had taken it upon themselves to form a council, or council of state. When the council got together and made decisions and made laws, that is what he was writing about. He was not creating our modern system as we know it. There was still plenty of monarchy, and the British kingdom was still ruled from London. It wasn't democratic, but that is the point: democracy did not exist.\n\nThat is the difference between Shakespeare's sense of British politics in his time, and the sense of American-style politics in the", "prompt_len": 75, "label": "gpt2"}

The same principle applies in reverse – it depends on what one means when one refers to morality. By the Oxford dictionary's definition, all the immoral are murder, treason, rape, child abuse, cannibalism and paedophilia. It is not clear whether all these are included in our definition. One thing is certain, however, that only half of the population are moral; the rest, in general, are moral (the remaining half are immoral). If we were to extend the definition to include moral as well as immoral persons, then, presumably, we could eliminate murder, theft, and burglary, but to eliminate adultery from our definition would require us to accept that adultery is a moral subject; and to extend to them both adultery and murder would require us to grant that adultery is morally identical to murder. If, from this broad definition, one were to conclude that all crimes are immoral, it would mean that all crimes were murder, robbery, rape, and so on, or that theft was a moral act, and vice versa; which would involve a total reorganisation of our whole moral theory.\n\nThe first assumption must always be avoided in such a sweeping view.

Secondly, immigrants are the most important reason why the UK voted to leave, so any policy aimed at stopping immigration would probably make the UK's exit from the EU more likely.\n\nFor instance, you would probably not get to the point that a referendum was held on an immigration ban, because it would risk alienating the EU27 with whom the UK actually has free trade.\n\nThis points in the direction of taking advantage of a Brexit vote to change the UK's relationship with the EU. That might help us reduce net immigration to the UK, particularly for high skilled workers. We could also, as some have suggested, agree to apply stricter quotas to immigrants coming to the UK for work purposes, to discourage people from coming here for economic reasons.\n\nBut this is the exception, not the rule. For most economic reasons migration has remained fairly constant.\n\nIf we're going to reduce net immigration further, we need to focus on how we can boost wages and employment for migrants in the UK rather than on how to deal with the EU's immigration policy.\n\nIn the long run we shouldn't lose sight of how much economic activity occurs in the EU, how that economy impacts the UK's, and how other countries in terms of trade, investment and migration could potentially fill the gap left once the UK leaves the EU.", "prompt_len": 154, "label": "gpt2"}

There is, however, an especially wide variety of concepts that linguists study. These include morphology, morphology-phonology, morphology-morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatic and semantic theory, and grammar.\n\nThe primary focus of linguistics revolves around how languages develop over time and across cultures. Thus, linguists spend much of their time examining phonology, the phonemic properties of words, and how such properties vary across languages. And they examine how people speak and construct their language, not just how languages spread. Linguists thus study the acquisition of language across a wide variety of conditions, such as the age of a child when hearing its first word, the social status of the speakers, and the use of the language by outsiders.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, linguistics often focuses more on semantics, the cognitive processes that generate meaning from linguistic speech, and how this information is translated into behavior.

It's an aspect of life many of us are accustomed to but he played up the emotional and psychological connection between him and the audience.\n\nThe music throughout the film is not only the soundtrack of Chaplin's incredible performance but is also used as a window into the emotional depths of Chaplin. So what are the themes of the film? Charlie Chaplin was a master at using music throughout his films, from his early shorts (he had a huge list of tunes that he could do whatever the hell he wanted with) to his later films. But what makes this film different is the way in which he used music. The film begins with music.\n\nIt's easy to say that the music of the film is just Chaplin playing his music to his audience, but that only gets to a fraction of the story. Chaplin has taken a classic comedy musical and made it one of the most powerful political and social works of all time. I think a big part of the film's success is that it has something for everyone, and it pulls off the impossible feat of being deeply funny in the midst of a film that is deeply important to its culture.\n\nThe music is used to express fear, anger, lust, betrayal, shame, joy, despair, ambition, and so many emotions people feel in life. It is the soundtrack to one's journey as a human being. Not because of the plot, but because of what it represents. It can be understood as the soundtrack to Chaplin's journey of self-discovery, as he finds himself in the greatest struggle of his entire life – against tyranny.\n\nThe film's music – particularly Chaplin's themes, although he plays these beautifully, too — is a metaphor for what happens to people when they are in the grip of a totalitarian regime. These themes and tunes are very relevant now, especially with regards to the rise of the Islamic State.

Not so.\n\nThe reason for the flaps and tuck box for the bonnet and shock absorbers for the floor are downforce and comfort. To protect from damage to the chassis when cornering, the front and rear undertray flaps are positioned at 45 degrees. However, the rear undertray has a slight depression in the centre which has an affect on the balance of the car when driving at speed. This also helps to improve the handling of the cars in slippery conditions like rain or snow-covered roads. The seats are made from high-density plastic, and are placed in parallel with one another to provide maximum comfort and support.\n\nIn a modern car, these areas (the hood and bonnet), and the undertray are often replaced by a large body mounted airfilter mounted behind the driver.

Was she seeking revenge on an elite who held the upper hand in the English establishment?\n\nWhen the 1764 General Election came around, she campaigned, unsuccessfully, for the Whig's candidate, Joseph Priestley, who had led the opposition to Charles II. Then, in August 1834, in the aftermath of the defeat of the Whigs to the Whigs, she gave a speech before her party's members, complaining of their 'waste and indolence'; 'the whole party is corrupt', she argued, 'and the whole system rotten and unsociable. Even the best and most respectable Whig is a liar and a cheat, like the rest.'\n\nSwift's hatred for Parliamentary democracy led her to be the first woman to speak in the House of Commons ever. Then, with her friend Alexander Gordon, she was elected as a Whig senator (though Gordon was elected as a Whig as well). Swift's opposition to Parliamentary rule led in 1834 to a campaign by her friends in the Whig party that culminated with the dissolution of Parliament – a'revolution'. Her friends demanded that she abandon her policy of non-cooperation with the government in the House of Commons, the parliamentary party, and the Parliament of the Whigs. She refused their demands. Her supporters saw the collapse of Parliament as the fulfilment of her political dreams. Her enemies saw it as the beginning of her downfall.\n\nI want to write a novel set in 1834.

Now assume you have $45 and the dealer gives you three cards ($22, $19, and $9) for a total of $46. You decide to play a $1 straight (I'll call the suit of the cards $S) because that is how you are being paid at that table. The first card you draw is a straight 3, and in this position, the $S straight is $1 in the Blackjack suit. However, the next card you draw is a 4 in the suit of the suit of the $9 straight (in other words, a 6-6). Consequently, your hand is a $23 straight 6, rather than the $46 straight. The fact that your hand is a $23 straight 6 is a function of the game's odds.\n\nI mentioned earlier that all betting systems are fair. Thus, if the Blackjack odds were 3 to 1, the $23 straight 6 would be fair to play. However, the Blackjack odds were 5 to 1 at the time you made the play, and if you had played a straight 6 instead, the odds would have been reversed. The opposite is also true. You can assume that in a $2/$1 hand game, you are always playing a straight unless you have an outstanding card in hand (which, by definition, is also a straight).\n\nIt's easy to remember these terms.

Polk along in its wake into the Mexican War of 1846; that expansionist fervor and humanitarian impulses created by an irresponsible yellow press propelled William McKinley into war against hapless Spain in 1898; that myopic popular isolationism restrained Franklin D. Roosevelt's realistic anti-Axis program in the late 1930s; that antiwar protesters humbled the once-omnipotent Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and forced both his withdrawal from public life and his de-escalation of the war in Southeast Asia ; and that the bitter memories of that war made it difficult for presidents to intervene militarily in the Third World during the last quarter of the twentieth century. Even if the most reasonable interpretation is the strongest the historian has to hand, the historian will inevitably conclude that a combination of history and sociology persuaded President Obama of the need to intervene with overwhelming force in Libya on Thursday.\n\nIt's not that the historical record is unimportant or that it doesn't matter to us now; it's just that the historical record alone doesn't tell the story we want told. We don't need to decide that one war in Iraq was inevitable based only on the evidence. We don't need to assume our military interventions in recent memory were justified—and, if they weren't, to declare it so—based on the fact that other presidents did the same thing or that there's a long and storied tradition of U.S. aggression in other countries. If there's a lesson to be learned from history, it's that history doesn't teach us what to think. Only our own thinking does: that, as a nation, we're capable of making history and that we are, by default, the creators of history.\n\nThis isn't to say that Obama wouldn't have acted anyway or that he never would.

When the two officers finally arrived in Oregon and Washington in 1805, a massive and unprecedented cultural shift had swept over the region: a generation of Americans, especially those living near the border towns, were learning to live in harmony. They were learning to live in the wilderness, for without any doubt a strange new way of life was emerging.

The Paiute's language, the Navajo language, emerged during a period of high migration and contact. The new language was based on an expanded grammar and vocabulary that began to show signs of a very high level of culture of the people.
