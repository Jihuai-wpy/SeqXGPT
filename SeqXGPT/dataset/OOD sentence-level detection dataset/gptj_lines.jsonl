His life contained a large amount of both great success and horror and one might ask whether his ideas and achievements deserve a place in the pantheon of important figures. His work - although he hated being known as a 'theoretical utilitarist' - remains highly influential. It has changed the face of ethics and, though he himself was concerned with how institutions interact with psychology and other natural sciences, he also had a good idea about how to design the institutions of the world.\n\nOne might ask how much of him should be represented in university.

Mascots act as a significant vehicle for communicating the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially children and youth. They create a close connection between them, the Olympic Games and their host cities.\n\nThe role of Mascots has also increased substantially since the Beijing Olymipics in 2008.

In his book Enzyme Nutrition, Dr. Edward Howell explains that because of the difference in food temperature and air temperature, it is safe to dehydrate at settings up to 145 degrees because the temperature of the food will not exceed 118 degrees.\n\nAnother myth is that dehydrating destroys the nutritional value of food. In fact, this is not true. The main food carbohydrates are sugars. Moisture is needed for these to crystallize and the crystallized sugar is the real source of our energy. If food is dried with enough sugars, it is possible to increase food energy, even up to 400 percent more than cooked food. Many people who are allergic or intolerant to some carbohydrate sources should check their food labels to choose products with the least amount of sugars possible. The less sugar, the smaller the calorie and carbohydrate cost.\n\nWhen processing food for long-storage, dehydration is a good way to conserve vitamins such as A, and C. Dehydration also conserves vitamin B-1, B-2, and D when fat is used as a binding medium.\n\nThe amount of moisture needed to deactivate enzymes varies according to the amount of moisture the food has in the first place. Cooking also destroys many enzymes, but to a lesser extent.\n\nFor a dehydrator to be effective for many foods, it must be set at 105 degrees or higher. Water content should be reduced to a point that the food dries evenly. For example, with most vegetables and fruit, it seems to need about a 45 percent moisture content in dry matter.

White sensitivity, much of it racist in origin, about unrestricted black Commonwealth immigration encouraged the Conservative government to impose limits on the numbers of people allowed into the UK.\n\nIn 1961, the Conservatives announced that they would build no more houses and that all current ones would remain. The result was that in the next five years, all the private housing market came to a halt by design. It could only be revived by a massive government housing programme and by state house building. This was how the Conservative party sought to regain the working class: through a massive building programme, for which the trade unions could then be blamed.\n\nIn 1963, the number of state employees, both civil and military, increased by more than half but state spending on unemployment benefits fell by 13 per cent, falling more than even the most optimistic employment experts had predicted. The Tory party also came up with the controversial slogan: ‘Labour Isn’t Working’.\n\nWhen Harold Wilson brought in a public expenditure squeeze in the wake of the 1968 electoral defeat, the Tory party quickly announced a public works programme and promised high pay. It also promised a limit on state employees, which was subsequently met by the trade unions being blamed. Then in the 1970s, the Tory party embarked on one of the most right-wing governments in the post-war era when it increased private house prices in the face of a rapidly growing public debt and a booming trade deficit, which was met by raising the money spent on old-age pensions.

Polk along in its wake into the Mexican War of 1846; that expansionist fervor and humanitarian impulses created by an irresponsible yellow press propelled William McKinley into war against hapless Spain in 1898; that myopic popular isolationism restrained Franklin D. Roosevelt's realistic anti-Axis program in the late 1930s; that antiwar protesters humbled the once-omnipotent Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and forced both his withdrawal from public life and his de-escalation of the war in Southeast Asia ; and that the bitter memories of that war made it difficult for presidents to intervene militarily in the Third World during the last quarter of the twentieth century.\n\nLippmann's critics in the twentieth century were no less numerous: the _New Republic_ and its intellectual sponsor, _The Nation,_ accused him of cowardice and lack of \"courage in the face of the facts\"; and Senator Joseph McCarthy cited him as an example of an \"unpatriotic leader,\" a phrase that was soon applied to other liberals and intellectuals, who had been called upon to speak out against the rising tide of anti-Communist hysteria.\n\nThe most influential of Lippmann's later critics in the United States, however, were the conservative writers Whittaker Chambers and Richard Rovere in the pages of _Time,_ and William F.

The city revolts of 1260–62 in Umbria and Perugia are well discussed by George N. R. De Vivo. In Venetia Ghibelline rule was confirmed by the papal ban on the Visconti family and the alliance with Siena, but Ghibelline rule was challenged by the Guelfs of Ravenna.

Some contemporary historians dispute Fiske's analysis. They claim that even the British Constitution of 1776 with its Preamble, written by Thomas Jefferson, was not the first written constitution.

Streep is mesmerizing as usual, but the mode of storytelling employed by screenwriter Abi Morgan and director Phyllida Lloyd  sporadic flashbacks among elongated stretches of following the elderly and mentally fragile Maggie  is a huge misfire. The scenes which recount her path from young adulthood through to local politics and then to her 11 years of turbulent leadership are intriguing, however they are too far and few between to really grip. At the beginning and at the end of the film when we see her first standing on the platform of the conference as Prime Minister, she seems like a force of nature. But then you find yourself questioning the details, and before you know it, your head is spinning like a pinball machine.\n\nStreep's depiction of Maggie is as warm, complex, and empathetic as her portrayals of women in The Devil Wears Prada and Sophie's Choice, but this time round, she doesn't have to try to be tough. Streep doesn't have to be the tough and intimidating woman with the voice like steel, you can't ever feel like you need to look up to Maggie  that's Streep for you. It doesn't feel like a performance where you need to feel threatened by her, and Morgan and Lloyd need to take some credit for that.\n\nThe problem with this film is that it never once feels like it's actually a portrait of Thatcher.

But the Battle of Balaclava was actually a victory rather than a defeat for the Russians.\n\nTo understand the role of the Russians in this conflict, it is first essential to understand the role that Russia played in the Balkans after the fall of the Ottoman Empire (an empire that had lasted for some 600 years and had been an important force in Western European politics for several centuries).

This included a system of precedent which provided the English courts the opportunity to use past trials as evidence in current investigations.

They lived on these little islands which were too small to support any other kind of species. These islands were the only places of safety for them since they could escape or hide from enemies that were hunting them.\n\nIn the late 1500’s, people were starting to trade their way to Japan. This began changing the way people lived. The Dutch wanted to be in control of what was happening on their shores. The Dutch sent ships to Mauritius with cargo. They told the people that they would be trading with Japan.\n\nOn their way to Japan, the Dutchmen took hundreds of turtles and sold them in Japan; where an eating them gave them longevity.

When Texas was annexed as a state of the United States in December 1845, the star was incorporated into the seal of the Republic of Texas. The star was eventually eliminated when the Texas state seal was standardized in 1856.\n\nIn June 2016 Donald Trump was asked about the possibility of establishing a presidential commission to examine the origin of the Star-of-Texas, after being told that a Texas county, which had adopted the Star as its official symbol, is seeking to use the Star in the name of its president’s re-election bid. Trump responded by saying “I have gotten to know Mike [Klepper] very well. He wrote a good book about a star and it was in Texas. But it’s a beautiful star. I’ve had this star for a long, long time.

He favoured cuts to personal income tax and business tax, lower government spending , the dismantling of the centralised wage-fixing system, the abolition of compulsory trade unionism and the privatization of government-owned enterprises , views that have dominated his subsequent career. Howard has maintained, throughout the Thatcher years and beyond, that the Thatcher years were the high point of a successful government. When, in the late 1990s, he had hoped that his wife Julia Gillard, who was Australia's first female Prime Minister, would run for the Liberal Party leadership, he publicly supported her bid for the job but, when he later discovered that Gillard planned to enter the race himself, he publicly opposed her. Although Howard remains a Conservative (or Liberal) by Australian political tradition, in practice he is a strong conservative and nationalist in the sense of being a European-style statist.\n\nOn 17 March 1990, Howard stood as an agent nominated by the Liberals to succeed the assassinated Neville Wran as New South Wales Premier.[2] He won the leadership election, and, in October 1990, became both the first Liberal Party leader and state leader of an Australian state to have been an elected parliamentary member, having previously been a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1973 to 1986 under Labor Premier Neville Wran.[3]\n\nOn the first page of the 1991 budget book, his then Treasurer Don Page gave a one-day summary of the government's budget intentions.

In 1830 his brother brought out Landor's _Cain_ and he wrote poetry on the subject of Cain's slaying Abel. This attracted the attention of John Kenyon, a well-known bookseller, who edited Tennyson's first published volume, the _Poems._ In the following year the publisher of the _London Magazine_ invited Tennyson to write \"A Dream of Fair Women,\" and he became a regular contributor to the periodical. _In Memoriam_, \"Fears in Solitudes,\" \"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\" \"The Lotos-Eaters,\" and _Records of Life and Death_ were the result of these years.

Madonna's early music and video is often compared to that of a young Mary Tyler Moore. Throughout Madonna's lifetime, she has talked with her fans openly. But Madonna's new show is attracting criticism for her use of the \"I'm Not Your Madonna\" speech. The speech features Madonna criticizing her mother for not leaving an impression on her by teaching her self-esteem.\n\nMadonna's speech has been called sexist and transphobic. Critics have also argued it is a transparent attempt to win over a young audience. Madonna has used the controversy to sell the new show. According to a Billboard report on the MDNA tour, Madonna has a 50% higher gross ticket sales of the first six months of this year than any other artist.\n\nIf you're an admirer of Madonna's music or her fashion sense from the '80s and '90s and curious about her past relationships, we've compiled a list of 20 Things You Didn't Know About Madonna.

{"text": "Montserrat is a British overseas territory located in the Leeward Islands, part of the chain of islands called the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. It measures approximately 16 km (10 miles) long and 11 km (7 miles) wide, giving 40 kilometres (25 miles) of coastline. Montserrat is often referred to as the Emerald Isle of the Caribbean, due both to its resemblance to coastal Ireland and to the Irish descent of most of its early European settlers.\n\nMontserrat was formed in 1632 from the old English possession of Montserrat, which had been purchased by England's first Duke of Cumberland in 1629, as well as the French possession of Saint-Denis Island.\n\nThe island is home to the highest mountain on the island, Mont Rose.\n\nThe island has a population of 6,939 (2006 est), of which 3,948 are of African descent. Around 95.6% are of African heritage. There are also large diaspora populations in Guyana, Barbados and Canada.\nThe island's name comes from the French term “Mont de Sureau” which is the name of the mountainous part of the island. It means “mountain of the giant”.\n\nMontserrat's most famous product is jonk berry which is made from the island's black berries. You can usually try it for free upon landing at the airport.\n\nIt was originally inhabited by the Montserrat of the same name who were mostly black Carib people. Later it was given an English name and in 1632 was included in the charter for the Isle of Montserrat, under which it has remained to this day.\n\nThe island was made a British colony on 1 July 1973, after having been a part of the Federation of the West Indies since 1973, until it was annexed 1 April 1976. The transfer was in exchange for the United States returning the US navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where over 300,000 Cuban dissidents were interned during the Cold War, a move known as the Cuban Transit Rights", "prompt_len": 454, "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "There are various factors that affect the Earth's albedo. Snow and ice are highly reflective so when they melt, albedo drops. Forests have a lower albedo than open land so deforestation increases albedo (but for the record, no, chopping down all our forests is not the solution to global warming). Water that absorbs solar radiation (e.g. large water bodies) has high albedo and is less reflective when compared to land and ice (if we could get the land and ice to melt, but we can't). Also, the moon has a higher albedo than anything on Earth (except ice or oceans) and the atmosphere has even higher albedo. \nHere are some rough estimates:\nAlbedo of the planet\nThe atmosphere: 7,9%\nSnow/Ice/Forests: 65%\nOpen land: 8,2%\nWater body: 32%\n\nAlbedo of the Sun's direct radiation \nThe sun: 0%\nMoon: 0.15%\n\nTherefore, if you were lucky enough to be able to change everything about the Earth's albedo without affecting the oceans or atmosphere, your albedo of the planet would be: \n\nAlbedo of the planet (without the sun radiation, since the sun is already covered in this answer): 2.3%\n\nWhich is pretty bad for a planet to not reflect any of its radiation back.

I will however, try and keep it as simple as possible and when it really comes down to it, its really not that hard if you put your mind to it. Also, although my explanation does explain the basics, your understanding of the science behind all this will only come with time.\n\nSo the purpose of this article is to give someone a basic overview regarding fruit flies and how they live and reproduce.

I myself have never been able to catch them, but from what I know, from what others have told me, most of the time, those caught in the wild are dead. That does not mean you can’t catch them, but you have a very small chance of getting one. If I remember correctly, the highest survival rate is around 7.5%.

{"text": "When an elected hereditary peer dies, there is a by-election, using a variant of the Alternative Vote system, to replace them. The electorate differs based on the group of the hereditary peer. In the case of party or Cross-Bench peers, the electorate is the party or group that elected the peer whose seat is now vacant.\n\nWhen an hereditary peer decides to step down from the House of Lords, a by-election to replace a vacant seat occurs after the usual general election. All peers who have the right to vote in the Commons are registered to vote in this by-election and also cast their votes in the election to choose another peer to become a member of the House of Lords. In recent elections this has only occurred in three cases: the death of Lord Strathclyde in 1997, after the 1997 general election, he was replaced by the Earl of Wessex and in May 2005 after Lord Bono died, after the 2005 general election Lord Strathclyde, the Earl of Wessex and eight other hereditary peers left the House and formed The Independents.\n\nWhen members of the House of Lords take up an appointment, this requires a House of Lords Act, which allows the House to alter the electoral qualifications (as well as the franchise and the method of appointment). However, such change is generally only made for the first appointment, which then gives effect to the provisions of the relevant House of Lords Act that have not hitherto been exercised.

If your first reaction is, \"that's been done before,\" you're wrong, the biggest name on the tour would not necessarily always be the headliner. They might have an opening act, but the headliner would simply be the biggest in the bill.

His approach has been described as one that relies on small changes occurring that are not noticeable by human senses alone. “I wanted to look at how the environment created in the barrel influenced the colour of red wine. If I’m to make a very dark, very dark red wine, I want the influence to be almost imperceptible. I wanted to see if I could make a very dark wine of that colour, and, in doing so, I wanted it to be very special.” Noilly is now working on experimenting to come up with the next level of barrel influence, with more complex and diverse flavours on the horizon.

This evidence-based policy statement, developed and edited by Cancer Prevention & Population Genetics, reviews the potential adverse effects associated with vaccination against HPV and summarizes data on vaccination effectiveness. The purpose of this article is to define high-risk HPV prevention for pre- and postmenopausal women and to describe HPV vaccination strategies, including the safety and effectiveness of HPV vaccines for adults at risk for cervical cancer. Clinicians, healthcare providers, and patients should have an understanding of and a shared decision-making process regarding HPV vaccination to enhance women’s personal health.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHigh-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and/or 18 are the primary causal agents of cervical, anal, and head and neck cancers. HPV vaccination (including Gardasil, Gardasil 9, and Cervarix vaccines) has resulted in significant reductions in the incidence of these cancers ([1]–[4]). To maximize the effectiveness of the HPV vaccines, the US FDA recommends that these vaccines be provided to female patients of reproductive age because of strong evidence for the efficacy of these vaccines to prevent HPV infection [5]. Several countries, including Italy and the United Kingdom, have extended the recommendations to include women of all ages who may be of reproductive age, given their lack of protection from sexual transmission of HPV and their potential to develop cancer or genital lesions as a part of their sexual and family life ([6]–[8", "prompt_len": 332, "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "THE design of coins is determined by a tradition going back at least to the time of Charles II that the direction in which the head faces should alternate between the coinage of successive monarchs. The only exception to this has been the coinage of Edward VIII, who insisted on his likeness facing left. It is not clear whether this was an expression of rebellion against convention, or vanity, to show what he regarded as his better profile, containing his hair parting.\n\nThe modern design of the head of the sovereign is by now well established – a dignified portrait of the head above a coin often carrying the inscriptions E. REX, DEI GRATIA and the date, in line with the tradition on which the designs on coins have been based since the reign of Charles II.\n\nThe coins of Edward VII and his brother George V were produced by engravers such as George McDougall, G.T.K.

As a result the quality of the coins of these monarchs is generally good.\n\nMany of the earlier coins, in particular prior to Edward VII, were of a poor quality, probably because of the problems in finding sufficient good die-hard material to make the plates for casting large numbers of coins. They frequently differ considerably from the published designs and have sometimes been criticised. The modern design, however, follows well a tradition and has remained broadly unchanged since then.\n\nEDWARD VII\n\nWhen George V died in 1936, there was a serious falling off in the production of coins.\n\nThe first serious change came in 1936, when the design on the first coin after George VI and Queen Elizabeth was produced was that of Edward VII, the only change being that in the centre of the coin, the date on coins of this reign did not go from 1936 to 1937. This change also applied to coins of George V and included the first coins of Queen Elizabeth II. The centre inscription, DED, was produced separately to one side, the edge inscription was ERIQ.REG., in what was the first appearance of the letters ERIQ.\n\nGeorge VI's reign took the tradition in some of the designs in the head.
