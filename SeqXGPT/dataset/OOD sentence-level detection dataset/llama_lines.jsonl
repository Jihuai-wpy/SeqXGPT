The Moonglows' first release on the label, a swooning doo-wop ballad called Sincerely, written by Fuqua and co-credited to Freed, and with Lester taking the lead vocal, reached No 1 on the US R&B hit parade in 1954, but the greater success of a cover version by the McGuire Sisters prevented them from rising above No 20 in the pop charts (the original version was later used by Martin Scorsese in his film Goodfellas).

One group kept the name Riksmål as their own unofficial form of Norwegian, and ignored the spelling and grammar changes of the Samnorsk movement. Riksmål and conservative forms of Bokmål have been the standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century. After the Bokmål and Riksmål reform, some have chosen not to use any of the two reform languages. These language activists who are called the \"old-timers\" use the historical Samnorsk form of written Norwegian (Nynorsk or Bokmål) and have kept the old grammar order, with the exception of some minor changes, as the spelling and grammar of the two languages were already quite similar. The minor changes consisted of combining the words \"ar\" and \"å\", \"till det\" and \"til det\", and \"med\" and \"mede\". Another form of written Norwegian is more rarely used. Dialectal Norwegian (Dia) is a written language based on a combination of written Norwegian and spoken Norwegian, and it was used by people who spoke dialects and read literary Bokmål or Nynorsk.

{"text": "Philosophers are known to coin thought provoking sayings that leave individuals in awe. One such question that has stood the test of time is “If a tree falls in a lonely forest, but there are no animals around, does it make a sound?” In 1884, the authors of Scientific American answered a different form of this question stating that sound is the perception of vibratory impulses transmitted via air or other media. So although the tree will generate vibration, if there are no ears to perceive it, then there is no sound.\nAnother intriguing question relates to whether or not light is a particle or a wave. The answer is both, and this was first recognized by a Dutch scientist named Frits Zernike in the 1930s. Zernike performed light scattering experiments on a liquid crystal that produced an interference pattern when light passed through it. The presence of an interference pattern is an indication that light is behaving like a wave when passed through the liquid crystal. The next step in his experiment was to pass polarized light through the crystal. Upon observing the interference pattern produced with this light, he had observed light behaving like a particle and not a wave. It is through experimentation that we are able to understand and see how light behaves in different situations.\nOne of the common misconceptions among students is that a lens bends light. In actuality, what a lens does is changes the focal distance that an image forms in. When an image is focused through a lens, it is because the focal point is different from the focal distance. In other words, light travels from the focal point at a certain speed and when a lenses changes the focal point, the image changes.

White sensitivity, much of it racist in origin, about unrestricted black Commonwealth immigration encouraged the Conservative government to impose limits on the numbers of people allowed into the UK. Labour made the issue a matter of ideology, and in their 1964 election manifesto promised to make no changes to immigration policy although, like Conservatives, they did promise to “take into strict consideration any proposal which the Government might make in respect of an immigration legislation to provide the essential safeguarding of a labour market in which those immigrants who could make a significant contribution to the economy could participate”. Labour won the election, its biggest majority to date, but its promise to be “strict” in enforcing the policy was quickly forgotten.

If there were two figures who dominated late-Seventies music in Manchester, it was Wilson and his friend, late journalist and music critic Paul Morley.\nThe two of them met in 1972 at Granada TV, when Wilson was a presenter and Morley a trainee.

It looked like the painting that Bowie does on the gatefold sleeve of Aladdin Sane. I was so excited.

She was 11 when she came to the United States for good, but her worldview would be shaped by those early experiences: \"My mindset is Munich,\" she said, referring to the infamous 1938 agreement that allowed Nazi Germany to occupy Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland. \"Most of my generation's is Vietnam.\" Her parents taught their children that they must stand with the United States and never forget that the Communists are \"the guys with the guns.\" They learned early on that, no matter where you settled, America was your home. She's lived on for decades, and now her son speaks fluent Chinese: A world away from my hometown in Oregon. The author grew up \"a very, very, very white child\" in a small town in Michigan: \"The only black person I knew in school was Pops, the guy who shoveled our front walk.\" She never got over one summer when their neighbor pulled up in a Cadillac and told her mom, \"Ladyyou should be wearing your hair in rollers, you're not a young, pretty girl. But for God's sake, don't put it all in a braid.\" This one will get you right there, feeling the outrage that she felt as a young personthose two and a half centuries of being wronged, of being denied access to the privileges afforded white people.

Sparta was known for its poetry and it pottery, its wares being found in places as far flung as Cyrene (in Libya) and the island of Samos, not far from the coast of modern-day Turkey. Researcher Konstantinos Kopanias notes in a 2009 journal article that, up until the sixth century B.C., Sparta appears to have had an ivory workshop. Ivory was often used for the manufacture of aphrodites, the symbolic figures of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and the ancient Greeks had various aphrodites made in ivory from the fourth to the third centuries. There is, perhaps, a lesson here in respect of the material to which we should pay attention, when it comes time to write the lyrics to our songs. Another point of interest in relation to early Spartans is that they, not unlike the modern-day Greeks, also used words to describe the physical appearance of a particular person. Indeed, the ancient Greek and, as well, the Latin terms for describing the physical characteristics of a person are quite complex.

In this    manuscript, The author has made an effort to present an    accurate and informative history of Lewis and Clark.  21  The author of this manuscript examined the primary source material on the saga of The Lewis and Clark Expedition. Primary documents were examined in order to reconstruct the narrative. Research was conducted at various archival facilities in Canada and the United States.  It must be noted that The author's research was conducted under the terms and conditions of Canadian archival facilities. As such, the author was limited at their archival facilities as it related to photographs and sound recordings, but was allowed to utilize the archival's original documents and transcripts. The primary source material included the two original diaries written between the months of September  of 1803 and September  of 1806, along with other secondary sources.

About them she said: “I don’t think anyone realises how much the last ten years has been a fulfilment of my youth.” A small bronze maquette, Three Hemispheres (1967), sat next to a photo of the Goonhilly satellite dishes. It looked quite feasible that the designers of those dishes might’ve borrowed directly from Hepworth in the making. In her studio on St Ives, you could almost find out-growing the artist. One wall looked as if it might fall down, but didn’t. You were just inches above the Atlantic: the ground was lava and the sea was a giant sheet of glass. The view of the sea looked like a window on a train. It is a studio which shows she was very keen to keep her eye on what was coming through the door. That window onto the world is what you sense first (and why you feel like you’re being watched). It is also what you feel, as you wander about among her things which seem to have been kept in the same order of her own. After the exhibition, I felt a little cheated. It was almost as though she had turned in her grave. It had felt like we were there in her home, in her studio, with her things. It had felt very much like a private view. I had even had a glass of wine. I had seen the real thing, I felt, and I felt like I had just been robbed. Now I’m trying to work it out: should I be grateful or angry? Gratitude because so many people have worked so very hard to bring Hepworth back to life. Anger because we have always known that the past can never truly return and that the most we could expect to see would be an approximation of the real thing – as Hepworth herself put it: “I have done my best to create the next life.” But is that not the point? The idea of next life, is there not, in that word “life”? Is Hepworth not showing us how life can be perpetuated long after the end?

{"text": "There are various factors that affect the Earth's albedo. Snow and ice are highly reflective so when they melt, albedo drops. Forests have a lower albedo than open land so deforestation increases albedo (but for the record, no, chopping down all our forests is not the solution to global warming). Increased desertification is, of course, also bad for albedo. Forests are also a source of water vapor that can increase the greenhouse effect so clear felling is also bad.\nIf global warming increases, it becomes more important than ever to preserve forests and also to replant woodland in desert areas.\nFurthermore, in the short term, we need to change our energy production away from fossil fuel to cleaner energy, such as nuclear power.

They are a group of insects that are the most commonly observed in the entire world. They come from the fruit that gets thrown away. Usually the people that put the fruit that gets thrown in trash bags are poor. The fruit flies are usually the most common insects that live near human habitations. Usually, their homes are warm, humid environments, such as near human latrines.(http://www1.hsac.edu.hk/infect/page11.htm)(http://www.biol.wwu.edu/biosearch/fruit.html) If the environment is not suitable for the organisms to live, they die out. So what does it tell us? Well, in a sense, it tells us where we live, how were living our lives. Its the same concept as having to throw garbage out, where do you throw it? Do you put it out in the forest and let the organisms take care of it? Well, maybe if things are a little different, that may happen. For the most part, the organisms would be taken back to where the garbage bag came from and either put back in the trash or thrown out someplace else.

The railways of Brunel and others spread nationwide, innovative       machines, products and processes of all kinds were developed,       plus of course the expansion of influence worldwide through the       creation of the British Empire. The 18th century was a formidable          challenge and there's little doubt that the 19th century achieved the       target. 6    In our view, 19th century Britain was certainly the most      successful of any historical period in the UK, and perhaps of all       the developed nations. 7    At least 22 of the United Kingdom's industrial cities of          more than a million population were established in Victorian times.          Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Bristol were amongst the           most successful. Liverpool in particular, whose population rose seven      times between 1831 and 1881, achieved international fame    for the development of shipping technology.

The brewer therefore has the flexibility to combine these with other ingredients (bitter hops, yeast, enzymes) to produce a wide range of finished beers.

The two men most celebrated for their victories over the Ottoman Empire are its own imperial founder, Mehmed, and the Hapsburg emperor of Italy, Charles V, who was defeated. Both would see this as a great tragedy, Mehmed as he saw Constantinople fall and Charles for his failure to complete his conquest of southern Italy. Mehmed was convinced that the world was coming to an end and that divine justice would be done by an angry and revengeful God, while Charles saw the future as bleak, not only for himself but also for Europe, whose position looked more and more threatened.

{"text": "THE design of coins is determined by a tradition going back at least to the time of Charles II that the direction in which the head faces should alternate between the coinage of successive monarchs. The only exception to this has been the coinage of Edward VIII, who insisted on his likeness facing left. It is not clear whether this was an expression of rebellion against convention, or vanity, to show what he regarded as his better profile, containing his hair parting. In coins of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, which followed soon after that of King Edward VII, it was decided that the head of a female monarch should be the same \"forward\" (left) as that of the monarch for whom she was portraited, \"the other way it being as a matter of custom, that when the man portraits the head has the direction in the contrary way.\" This resulted in the changeable directions of the heads of the sovereigns of the 16th Century, but it also showed a pre-emptition of the new coinage regulations which were to cause a major difficulty for the designers of the coinage of Queen Elizabeth II. Queen Elizabeth I had three coats on her arms, and two were worn; the direction of the head on the arm which wore the coat and \"chaplet\" of white was backwards compared with the direction of the head on the other arm, which had no coat or white chaplet. It was decided that \"the direction of all heads would be the same towards the upper-part of each of the two arms of the Royal Monarch, viz. forward.\" It is not surprising that this should have had an awkard conclusion. It had been considered that each coat on the arms should be \"a little longer than its usual form, and that the hands should be in the act of holding them or of drawing them on.\" This would have had the inconvenient effect that \"the same hands would hold as many as there were coats on each arm.

The August 1911 version of the handbook changed this to Eagle Scout. The medal illustrated in the handbook was a profile of an eagle in flight, but was changed to the current design before any were issued. On December 29, 1912, a resolution was passed to create the Distinguished Service Medal. In the same resolution a new Eagle Scout Medal was endorsed with this text: \"The Distinguished Service Medal, and Eagle Scout Medal, (to be made by the most skillful designer), shall be presented in the same manner as the other decorations and awards, but shall not be worn on the left breast.\" Because these were official decorations, they could not be worn on the left breast. The design of the Distinguished Service Medal was actually the old Eagle Scout Medal with the word Eagle Scout at the center of the medal. Originally there was a small star in the upper left portion of the medal. As the Distinguished Service Medal was a higher award than the Eagle Scout Medal, it was necessary to create a higher award to which the star could be attached. The Distinguished Service Medal was redesigned and introduced on September 4, 1912 . All 12, prior Eagle Scout Medals were presented to recipients and returned.

{"text": "Because of concern about Hyacinthoides non-scripta coming      under pressure in the wild, the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside      Act makes it a protected plant and the legislation was further      enhanced in 1998 making it an offence to trade in wild      Hyacinthoides non-scripta bulbs or seeds. The difficulty of      proving that a Hyacinthoides non-scripta bulb is not from a wild      source means that only the Spanish bluebell is sold by garden      centres. It is said that the Hyacinthoides hispanica was first      introduced to the UK in the 17th century so the measures taken      in the late 20th century can’t be wholly to blame for the      dominance of the Spanish bluebell in the commercial market. However,       it has not proved to be the threat to wild bluebells that some have assumed.      In a 2002 review Hunt (2002) commented that most of      this concern seemed to be “rather unwarranted”. Hyacinthoides 13    non-scripta is found growing naturally in the wild along the      coast of South Wales; however most of the commercial varieties     of Spanish bluebell are being grown from seed on the      Iberian Peninsula. The hybrids tend to flower earlier and     these are the varieties being cultivated for sale to commercial      growers and gardeners. It was found that the variety sold      in supermarkets had been grown in Spain for a number of years  14       with this Spanish bluebell then being sold as a separate   variety. The varieties of Spanish bluebell with the brightest       colours tend to carry the largest seeds. These bluebell seeds or      “pips” have small spines (Hunt 2005) which means that     these plants tend to be easier to find than hybrid plants with    “blossom” colour variation having brighter petals which     tend to wither earlier and making identification of these    plants more problematic. A study of commercial and wild     Spanish bluebell found that the Spanish bluebell had a     greater number of seeds per bulb and the commercial varieties           had more seeds than the wild variety (Wilson and Wilson   1994).

{"text": "As the Civil War began, poorer farmers were generally indifferent to questions of slavery and states' rights. But on the other hand, the landowning and aristocratic Southern planter class strongly supported the political status quo of white supremacy and the protection of the institution of slavery. White and black Southerners disagreed about many issues. But generally, African American Southerners were committed to the emancipation of enslaved people in the future, or after a war was over. White Southerners in general, particularly those who were non-slave holding and who were not wealthy or aristocratic, were strongly opposed to war. To fight and possibly die for a cause which would not result in the abolition of slavery, for example during the Civil War would have been incredibly difficult for a white Southern slaveholder and his or her family. After the war, most African American Southerners continued to view the white Southern planters and their families as being committed to the preservation of white supremacy, and to the destruction of their own families and communities. Most African American Southerners rejected the planter class and its politics as the result of the war and the experience of slavery and Reconstruction . For many African American Southerners, these views and their experiences were to directly affect how they viewed and thought about politics in the United States decades later, particularly views of the Democratic Party, segregation, Reconstruction, the Civil Rights Movement, and Black History Month.
