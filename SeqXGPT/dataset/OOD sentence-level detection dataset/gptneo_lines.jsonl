He subsequently became headmaster of the City of Bristol Grammar School, where, while making a tour of the county of Kent, he visited a large class of pupils who were being taught for the first time in England. His experience as a teacher inspired him to write his greatest sonata, The Fall of the House of Usher, and for this he was awarded the Nobel prize in Literature in 1859. He was the leading English poet of the nineteenth century. He died in London on 20 December 1882 with a state funeral, which was attended by the Queen and other members of the royal family.

As a result, many ships would not dock at port for several winters. On one such winter, the Benbow was one of six ships anchored in a large bay. Captain Frederick Evans was a hard-nosed sailor who, when the first mate was drowned, was the captain of the surviving vessel, and he decided that the Benbow would be the first of his ships to dock at port again. He therefore invited the boy and three friends to join him in the ship's company. They became part of his crew permanently, and a great adventure began. A large party of men from another ship arrived at Benbow the next day, and the six were introduced to the four returning sailors. The four new sailors would be called the Red Indians by the sailors, and they decided that if the Indians found any gold they would leave with the ship.\n\nThe captain of the HMS Enterprise, a navy ship, was Captain Benbow (later identified as Mr. Evans in his will), and he invited the Red Indians to land at the Benbow and join the crew.

Forests have a lower albedo than open land so deforestation increases albedo (but for the record, no, chopping down all our forests is not the solution to global warming). Clouds are opaque and reflect a great deal of radiation, so cloud cover decreases albedo.\n\nOne could say the sun is the only thing keeping the Earth's atmosphere aloft with zero reflection of solar radiation but that would be to miss the fact that our climate is in its warming phase at the moment, so we need net radiation to be absorbed by Earth to keep its atmosphere in its current condition.

He offers to clean it off if she will marry him, and after giving her a bath, Tatiana realizes it was heroin-a drug that would not affect her.

However, their behavior appears to be a little unusual for a fruit fly. So, since you mentioned it, perhaps we can begin with that.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, that we have an incredible amount of fruit flies that we have had working on our fruit flies project. We started with a very simple plan that has now been successfully implemented. The idea was to have flies move certain areas of cages, or fly around certain places on our computer workbench. Because of the incredible mass of fruit flies that we have been using to help us accomplish our goal, we started to get an incredible amount of movement and movement patterns. So we created a \"motion capture\" system to record the motion of all the fruit flies. What was happening was that we would have a group of fruit flies come around a certain point in the cage and then, after a certain amount of time, we would put the \"capture\" camera at this point in the cage and record the images. These images would then be played through an infrared laser. It turns out that these lasers have a property called \"tolerance\". What we discovered was that some of the flies were moving far enough along that there was some distortion in the images that we were getting from the laser.\n\nAll you have to do to solve this problem is to find an image that is free of any distortion.

In the case of Lord Lieutenant peers (the equivalent of an earl and heir apparent) and Lords Spiritual, the electorate is the Church or the Diocese of the church or institution represented by that peer who is now deceased—these can be represented by a single electorate, which does not have preferential vote thresholds in each election but can weight its representation differently against the electors whose own parties or dioceses do have thresholds in each election.\n\nThe main exceptions to the electoral system for hereditary peers are where an earl and heir apparent is succeeded by one of his male descendants, with the resulting change that the peer takes the place of no peer at all—in other words, the peer ceases to occupy a peerage, but is still in the Peerage of England.\n\nIn the Peerage of England the electoral system is broadly conservative; it favors a small but influential group of landowners, lawyers, churchmen or bankers, and a single-member electorate, which can include a range of candidates from all parties, with varying weighting depending on which party or church group has candidates elected.\n\nIn Scotland, the main party system was changed when the election of the King's Advocate was taken away from Westminster and put instead at a by-election, thus creating a single party system and also changing the electoral system, with the government parties now the largest party without party-specific threshold requirements, so parties are no longer allocated electoral constituencies, but each person who runs as a candidate for the party receives as much as 25% of them.

Had Milner taken over control of the first British Army, the day might have turned out very differently, but the Prime Minister and his Secretary of State were not to be influenced by the military’s plans without first consulting Lloyd George and his Chief of the Imperial General Staff. On the 29th of January, Lloyd George was advised by Milner that the war would be on in France in two days: this turned out to be a lie as it had already been expected for some time by the general public, but Lloyd George and his immediate successors did not listen to Milner. Within twenty-four hours, British troops were already marching down the Champs-Elysees in Paris, taking up positions on the south-west front. Before long, British planes, gunners and men were at the front line, ready to ‘cut off the trenches from the enemy without waiting for reinforcements’.

It had been a ground-breaking development of the 1951 Lotus 17, powered by a Rolls-Royce R, but the engine was not very powerful, resulting in poor mileage (10.9 miles per gallon, which was still high by the standards of those days) and a poor turning circle, while the car looked poor on the track. Despite these problems, however, the Lotus was an immediate success and it became the standard racing car in most modern countries until the 1980s when road-car manufacturers began their domination of Formula One.

{"text": "Today it is star chefs of Asian descent who are most aggressive about advocating for MSG, which still lies under a health stigma. A lot of these chefs, it seems, learned to cook with added MSG in the home. Cooks were obviously using umami, without quite having the concept, long before Ikeda worked out the chemistry.\n\nIt is easy to understand why chefs are upset. A lot of chefs learned about Japanese culture through Ikeda’s work. But Ikeda’s work was just that– a work. And the food he developed was designed for that culture in the 1930s. His understanding of how umami and other flavor molecules worked was, by the mid-1930s, long after Japanese society had embraced an idea of modernization that was really quite foreign to Japan. But what is most important here is that, no matter how modern cooking is, there is still a lot to be learned from any chef or cook. A real one who took a step back and understood the history they have been told was important in the understanding of what makes a good dish. That was Ikeda, and I believe he deserves all the praise you give him today.\n\nUmami? If you go to Wikipedia, they tell you it’s “the taste and characteristic flavor of highly reduced and complex carbohydrates, usually in combination with other tastes and flavors.” It’s a difficult mouthfeel for me to explain with words. One of the challenges, it seems, is that even after reading the definition of umami, I don’t know what the definition means and it seems a bit difficult to define myself, even with an open mind.\n\nWhen a dish doesn’t have a strong Japanese identity, or it was not an important part of Japanese cuisine, that is what gives it the umami. I believe some chefs feel that there aren’t a lot of Japanese flavors around, and perhaps that is a good thing in the end. If the Japanese are moving into America, I don’t think we need more flavors from them. They probably won’t bring back the umami. However, we Americans, I believe, have more ways to add flavors than the Japanese, even if it seems difficult knowing what is actually", "prompt_len": 317, "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "The BSA's highest award was originally conceived as the Wolf Scout, as shown in the June 1911 Official Handbook for Boys . The August 1911 version of the handbook changed this to Eagle Scout. The medal illustrated in the handbook was a profile of an eagle in flight, but was changed to the current design before any were issued. In a September 1921 newsletter the BSA noted that the Silver Star for merit, first awarded in 1920, was a more appropriate award for Eagle Scouts. These designations are distinct because Scouts earn a Silver and then move on to a Gold. In a 1918 manual of rules and regulations, it called these Silver Scouts \"Eagles\" and stated: \"A Scout who has earned the Eagle Scout medal, the most coveted Scout badge, should act as though he was a Gold Scout of the Boy Scouts of America.\" The 1918 handbook states that \"a Scout with this medal should act as though he was a Gold Scout of the Boy Scouts of America.\"\n\nThe name Eagle Scout was dropped in 1940 as BSA's rank policy changed and the name Scout became an institution within Scouting itself, as the Scout Oath and Scout Law established the ideal by which all Scouts should be judged. This is why the BSA uses a badge now known as the Award of Excellence, which was designed to honor the original Eagle Scout as an ideal. There is now also the Award of Merit to give an example to show what a Scout could achieve by good conduct.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America was founded in 1910 by Theodore Roosevelt and his friends, Theodore and Jane Bullitt, in response to a national emergency that threatened a youth revolution. They called their organization \"The Boy Scouts of America\" in early 1921 in order to distinguish it from The United States Boy Scouts. The second word, \"Boy\", was dropped in early 1938 and the word \"Scouts\" was dropped after 1936 as well, to reflect the association of Scouts with the Girl Scouts in 1909.\n\nEarning The Eagle Scout MedalA boy who is a Eagle Scout receives two medals—the Silver and then, later, the Gold.

{"text": "As the Civil War began, poorer farmers were generally indifferent to questions of slavery and states' rights. The slaveholding planters held the most political power, however, and after some hesitation, Arkansas seceded (1861) from the Union. In the Civil War, Confederate defeats at Pea Ridge (Mar., 1862), Prairie Grove (Dec., 1862), and Arkansas Post (Jan., 1863) led to Union occupation of N Arkansas, and General Grant's Vicksburg campaign separated states W of the Mississippi from the rest of the Confederacy. In the postwar period, as Confederate forces began retreating toward re-established slave territory in Louisiana and Texas, some southerners hoped for reconciliation.\n\nSlavery had always been contested. Northern supporters generally supported slavery; Southern critics supported abolition. This controversy was exacerbated by the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 (ch. 5, 9 Stat. 441), which allowed citizens to sue for the return of runaway slaves. It also authorized federal agents, including such abolitionists as Senator Charles Sumner (R-MA) and Representative John P. Hale of Minnesota, to arrest and search suspected fugitives at any time.\n\nIn an 1836 speech Lincoln had stated that emancipation \"in itself is self-evident. It seems to me it should be so. The children of this nation [are] growing up with the knowledge they are citizens.\" Shortly thereafter, he signed the \"Emancipation Proclamation\" on April 4, 1863. This proclamation ended slavery by national consensus and authorized the admission of free blacks to federal civil service and the military. Some Northerners criticized Lincoln for making emancipating slaves too easy. They argued that blacks should be made to work on agricultural plantations, so they could learn the skills needed to be free-workers rather than slaves. Southern supporters generally rejected this argument, however, while urging white southerners to remain slaves until they died. This debate continued for years after emancipation.\n\nEmancipation in Louisiana\n\nWhen Louisiana was freed in 1804, the state's slaves (1,900) and free whites (1,200) were held as property in private ownership. The Louisiana legislature, however, declared that no one could own slaves until they were fully emancipated. It was only after emancipation began in 1822 that more blacks could be freed.\n\nIn 1804, the First Congress of the Confederation made a small appropriation for the purchase and colonization of free blacks and freed slaves on the east and west coasts of", "prompt_len": 516, "label": "gptneo"}
