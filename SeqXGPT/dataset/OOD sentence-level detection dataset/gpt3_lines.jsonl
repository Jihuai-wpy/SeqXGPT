The Moonglows' first release on the label, a swooning doo-wop ballad called Sincerely, written by Fuqua and co-credited to Freed, and with Lester taking the lead vocal, reached No 1 on the US R&B hit parade in 1954, but the greater success of a cover version by the McGuire Sisters prevented them from rising above No 20 in the pop charts (the original version was later used by Martin Scorsese in his film Goodfellas). Despite the setback with their first Chess release, The Moonglows went on to achieve further success with classics such as \"Ten Commandments of Love\" and \"See Saw.\" The group's popularity continued to grow with appearances on American Bandstand and tours with other prominent R&B acts of the time. However, internal conflicts began to surface and eventually led to the departure of several members, including key songwriter Harvey Fuqua. The group continued on, albeit with a shifting lineup, and remained active well into the 1960s. Despite the changes, The Moonglows' signature harmonies and soulful ballads remained highly influential on subsequent generations of artists, and their impact on the development of R&B cannot be overstated.", "prompt_len": 819, "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "During the reforms to bring Nynorsk and Bokmål closer, others opposed the changes and decided to maintain the originals. One group kept the name Riksmål as their own unofficial form of Norwegian, and ignored the spelling and grammar changes of the Samnorsk movement. Riksmål and conservative forms of Bokmål have been the standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards a more inclusive approach to language and a recognition of the value of dialects. This led to the creation of a new, official language variant called Norsk, which seeks to blend elements of both Bokmål and Nynorsk while also incorporating regional dialects. The aim is to create a more flexible and adaptable language that reflects the diversity of Norway's linguistic heritage and the changing needs of its society. This approach has been met with some resistance from traditionalists, but it has also been celebrated by those who see it as a way to promote greater unity and understanding among Norwegians, regardless of their linguistic background. Today, the Norwegian language continues to evolve and adapt, reflecting the ongoing changes and complexities of Norwegian society.", "prompt_len": 387, "label": "gpt3re"}

This tension is not unique to my situation. It is present in many aspects of our personal and professional lives. We often find ourselves struggling between being loyal to our relationships and being true to ourselves. Similarly, businesses face the challenge of maintaining their commitment to stakeholders while adapting to changing market trends and consumer demands. \n\nIn my case, the 10-year term is a deliberate effort to balance these two values of fidelity. It allows for a period of stability and continuity, while also ensuring that fresh perspectives and ideas can be brought in after a certain amount of time. It reflects a commitment to the organization, but also an understanding that no one person should hold too much power. \n\nUltimately, I believe that this tension between fidelity and independence is necessary for growth and progress. It forces us to constantly ask ourselves whether we are being true to our values and goals, while also remaining open to new opportunities and perspectives. It challenges us to be loyal and committed, but also adaptable and flexible. \n\nAs I embark on this 10-year term, I am both excited and humbled by the opportunity to contribute to the organization's mission. I recognize the responsibility that comes with this role, and I am committed to upholding the values of fidelity and independence that have been woven into its fabric.", "prompt_len": 344, "label": "gpt3re"}

Nearly all of Britain's present overseas territories (Gibraltar has a castle), like the Falkland Islands and the Virgin Islands, have this symbol in their flags. The significance of the Union Jack extends far beyond its use in national flags. It is also a popular design motif used in clothing, home decor, and even tattoos. The flag's popularity is partly due to its association with the British Empire, which spanned much of the globe in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Union Jack was flown over colonies and territories across Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Even today, many former colonies still incorporate the flag in their designs to honor their shared history with the United Kingdom. However, the flag's history is not without controversy. Some see it as a symbol of colonialism and oppression, while others view it as a testament to Britain's cultural heritage. Regardless of one's interpretation, the Union Jack remains one of the most recognizable symbols in the world.", "prompt_len": 308, "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "The most characteristic North American fashion trend from the 1930s to the end of World War II was attention at the shoulder, with butterfly sleeves and banjo sleeves, and exaggerated shoulder pads for both men and women by the 1940s. The period also saw the first widespread use of man-made fibers, especially rayon for dresses and viscose for linings and lingerie , and synthetic nylon stockings . The zipper became widely used. In addition to the shoulder-centric designs and use of man-made fibers, there was also a rise in patriotic fashion during this time period. American flag motifs, military-inspired designs, and colors of red, white, and blue were prevalent. This reflected the country's involvement in the war and a sense of national pride. \nAs the war progressed, fashion became more practical and functional, with clothing designed for women who were taking on new roles in the workforce. This led to more tailored, simplified designs with less emphasis on frivolous details. Accessories such as hats and gloves also became more practical, with simple and functional designs. \nBy the end of the war, fashion began to shift again, with a return to more glamorous and feminine designs. The end of rationing and access to new fabrics and materials led to an explosion of new styles, including full skirts, nipped-in waists, and the iconic New Look silhouette introduced by Christian Dior. \nOverall, the fashion trends of the 1930s and 1940s reflected the tumultuous events of the time, from the Great Depression to World War II, and the changing roles and expectations of women.

The centre of the track had always been a free part of the course to watch the Derby so it would have been here that the many working-class Londoners came to watch the race, smoking and drinking, and enjoying a rare day away from the grimy smoky city near by. Despite the differences in social class, people from all backgrounds came together to enjoy the spectacle of the Epsom Derby. The high society elites would arrive in their carriages and attend the luxurious events surrounding the race, while the working-class Londoners made the most of the free space in the centre of the track. The atmosphere was lively, with the sound of horses galloping and the cheers of the crowd filling the air. Smelling of sweat, alcohol, and tobacco smoke, the centre of the track was a place where social differences were forgotten, and everyone was united in their love of horse racing. As the horses thundered around the final bend and raced towards the finish line, the excitement reached fever pitch, with everyone holding their breath to see who would cross the line first.

{"text": "Unfortunately, as Bennett Greenspan pointed out, Y-DNA doesn't usually  last more than 100 years in the remains of a dead person whose body isn't  well-preserved (such as frozen or mummified), so direct testing of Khazar  bones may be impossible, but on the other hand some advances have  recently made possible the testing of ancient DNA from bones, teeth, hair,  etc. This new technology has already yielded some surprising results when it comes to the genetic history of ancient populations that were previously difficult to study. For example, recent studies have shown that Neanderthals and Denisovans interbred with modern humans, leaving traces of their DNA in our genomes. It's possible that similar techniques could be used to extract and analyze Y-DNA from Khazar remains, even if they're not perfectly preserved. \n\nAnother avenue for exploring the genetic legacy of the Khazars is through their descendants. While the Khazar Khaganate itself disintegrated by the 12th century, many Khazar Jews migrated to other parts of the world and contributed to the gene pool of various populations. By analyzing the DNA of people who claim Khazar ancestry, it may be possible to trace the genetic markers of the Khazar Y-DNA and shed light on their genetic history and ancestral origins.\n\nRegardless of the challenges in directly testing Khazar remains, it's clear that the study of ancient DNA has opened up exciting new opportunities for understanding the genetic diversity and history of human populations around the world. As advances in technology continue to improve the resolution and accuracy of these techniques, it's possible that we may one day have a much clearer picture of the Khazar people and their place in the story of human migration and evolution.", "prompt_len": 369, "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Similarly, Miliband might also note that the public had little faith in Labour’s ability to manage immigration but still voted the party to power in 1964. After the 1958 Notting Hill riots , immigration quickly became a salient political issue for the first time. White sensitivity, much of it racist in origin, about unrestricted black Commonwealth immigration encouraged the Conservative government to impose limits on the numbers of people allowed into the UK. This led to the Commonwealth Immigrants Act of 1962, which restricted immigration from the Commonwealth to those who had a job offer in the UK. Despite this, immigration remained a contentious issue and the Labour government that came to power in 1964 was faced with the challenge of managing it effectively. The government introduced further restrictions on immigration with the Commonwealth Immigrants Act of 1968.\n\nHowever, Miliband might argue that while the public had concerns about immigration, they were not the only issue on which the election was fought. The economy, education, and health were also significant issues that influenced voters' decisions. Labour's ability to address these issues effectively most likely played a larger role in their victory than their stance on immigration.\n\nFurthermore, Miliband could point out that attitudes towards immigration have shifted since the 1960s. Today, many of the concerns that led to restrictions on immigration in the past are no longer relevant. For example, the UK has a much more diverse population and a strong multicultural identity. Labour's policies on immigration need to reflect these changes and focus on promoting diversity and addressing concerns such as migrant workers' rights rather than simply imposing restrictions.", "prompt_len": 463, "label": "gpt3re"}

Polk along in its wake into the Mexican War of 1846; that expansionist fervor and humanitarian impulses created by an irresponsible yellow press propelled William McKinley into war against hapless Spain in 1898; that myopic popular isolationism restrained Franklin D. Roosevelt's realistic anti-Axis program in the late 1930s; that antiwar protesters humbled the once-omnipotent Lyndon Johnson in 1968 and forced both his withdrawal from public life and his de-escalation of the war in Southeast Asia ; and that the bitter memories of that war made it difficult for presidents to intervene militarily in the Third World during the last quarter of the twentieth century. All of these examples suggest that public opinion and pressure from interest groups have regularly influenced U.S. foreign policy decisions. However, some argue that this popular influence is not necessarily detrimental to national interests. Rather, a healthy debate and participation from the public can shape policy in a way that reflects the values and goals of the American people. Additionally, presidents and other policymakers have agency and the ability to resist pressures from interest groups and the public if they believe it would be harmful to national security or other important goals.

Basenjis, like dingos and some other breeds of dog, come into estrus only once annually, as compared to other dog breeds which may have two or more breeding seasons every year. Both dingos and Basenjis lack a distinctive odor, and are prone to howls, yodels, and other undulated vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. Another trait that Basenjis share with Pariah dogs is their strong hunting instincts, as they were originally bred for hunting small game in their native Africa. The breed is known for their agility and speed, and have even been used for hunting alongside humans in some cultures. They also have a tendency to be independent-minded, making them a challenging breed to train. However, their intelligence and loyalty make them great companions for those who are willing to put in the time and effort to properly socialize and train them. Despite their similarities to Pariah dogs, Basenjis are recognized as a distinct breed by most major kennel clubs.", "prompt_len": 400, "label": "gpt3re"}

They combed through old church records, census data, and graveyards, searching for any scrap of information that might connect us to a distant ancestor.

The first cannon in Europe were probably used in Iberia , during the Reconquista , in the 13th century, and English cannon were first deployed in the Hundred Years' War , at the Battle of Crécy , in 1346. Soon, cannons began to evolve and become more sophisticated weapons. They were utilized extensively in the battles of the Renaissance era, with armies on both sides often bringing large numbers of cannons to the battlefield. However, the primitive design of early cannons made them difficult and dangerous to operate, and often resulted in accidental explosions or other malfunctions. It wasn't until the 16th century that major advances were made in cannon technology, with innovations like the breech-loading cannon and the improved cast iron barrel leading to more reliable and powerful weapons.

Italy had several reasons for this decision, including territorial ambitions and a desire to gain influence in post-war Europe.\n\nOn April 26, 1915, Italy signed the Treaty of London with the Allies, agreeing to enter the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary in exchange for territorial concessions in Austria-Hungary and the promise of other rewards. Italy declared war on May 23, 1915, and joined the conflict on the side of the Allies.\n\nItaly's entry into World War I had significant consequences. The Italian front became a major theater of the war, with fierce fighting taking place in the Alps and along the Isonzo River. Italy suffered heavy losses, with over 600,000 soldiers killed and numerous civilian casualties.\n\nIn addition, Italy's decision to side with the Allies played a crucial role in the outcome of the war. The Italian army played a key role in the defeat of Austria-Hungary and the Central Powers, helping to break the stalemate on the Western Front and hastening the end of the war. Despite the heavy toll of the war, Italy emerged as a major power in Europe and was granted significant territorial gains through the Treaty of Versailles.", "prompt_len": 202, "label": "gpt3re"}

We tried to secure a handmade bat in the mass market place and a facility where people could be personally involved in their own bat. I believe it is a trade that should still offer this service, but unfortunately it is fast becoming a behind closed doors industry and get what your given, with a fair amount of pot luck. This is why Screaming Cat gives players a chance to handpick their own piece of willow and watch it transform, using traditional methods, into a bat that is tailored to their style of play. It's a unique experience that has garnered a loyal following among both amateur and professional cricketers. \n\nBut it's not just about keeping the tradition alive. JM also sees it as an opportunity to support local craftsmen and women, who often struggle to compete with cheaper, mass-produced bats. By offering a premium product that is handmade by skilled artisans, he hopes to give these makers a platform to showcase their talents and earn a fair wage for their work. \n\nOf course, there are challenges to running a business like this in today's market. Production times are longer and costs are higher, meaning that Screaming Cat bats are not cheap. But for those who are willing to invest in quality, the rewards are clear. A handmade bat not only performs better on the field, but it also carries a sense of history and artistry that is hard to find elsewhere. \n\nIt may be a niche market, but for JM and his team, the passion for their craft and the respect for those who came before them is what keeps them going. And as long as there are people who appreciate the value of a handcrafted bat, they will continue to do what they do best.", "prompt_len": 451, "label": "gpt3re"}

Phonology, on the other hand, is concerned with the abstract system of sounds in a language - how they combine to form words and how they are used to convey meaning.\n\nWhile phonetics provides the raw data for phonology, it is the latter that gives us insight into the structure and function of language. For instance, phonology can tell us why certain sounds are distinguished in one language but not in another, and how a single sound can be perceived differently depending on its context.\n\nDespite their differences, phonetics and phonology are intertwined and depend on each other to paint a complete picture of the sound medium of language.

{"text": "Like many other cities of Continental Europe, Vienna originated in ancient Roman times. In the first century AD , the Romans set up a military camp, called Vindobona, which formed part of the large number of similar facilities along the Limes frontier. The camp was located at the site of present-day Vienna, and its strategic location allowed the Romans to control the Danube River. The name Vindobona is thought to come from the Celtic word for white, referring to the river's white water. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, Vienna became a settlement for the Bavarii people. In the late 12th century, Vienna became the capital city of the Duchy of Austria and later, in the 16th century, the capital of the Habsburg Empire. During this time, Vienna became a center of arts and culture, as well as politics and power.

Victorian tourists knew Derwent Water as the ‘Queen of the Lakes’ although it has to be admitted that some called it, somewhat less politely, the Devil’s Chamberpot, because of the frequent rain some people believe they get round here. Putting Borrowdale’s reputation for wet weather to one side for the time being, the Day 7 shelf of the ‘cabinet of beauties’ is crammed to bursting with goodies, so much so that today’s walk can be counted as a Lakes classic.

The steep slopes are lined with lush greenery, providing us with a feeling of being almost enclosed by nature’s beauty. We cross the River Derwent over the Bowder Stone, an enormous boulder balanced on a small rock, and continue our ascent through the Seathwaite Valley. The higher we climb, the more dramatic the scenery becomes, with cascading waterfalls and majestic peaks dominating the view. We eventually reach Sty Head Pass, a high col with panoramic views across to Scafell Pike and the surrounding peaks. A steep descent to the beautiful black tarn of Sprinkling Tarn follows, before we eventually reach our campsite in the remote and peaceful Langstrath Valley.

The \"Great Hunger\", known as An Gorta Mor in Gaelic, happened in an era when millions of people knew only famine, oppression, and degradation. The potato famine itself was a natural disaster such as a flood or an earthquake, and there is no way to predict when such an event will happen. However, the root cause of the Irish famine was not solely the failure of the potato crop but also the overarching social, political, and economic conditions that existed in Ireland at the time. The British government's policies of land ownership and tenancy had allowed absentee landlords to extract high rents from small tenant farmers, leaving them with little means to invest in their farms or alternative sources of food. The Irish peasantry was also subject to discriminatory laws and harsh treatment by British authorities, leaving them with few options to improve their situation.\n\nThe response to the famine was slow and inadequate, with many politicians and officials blaming the Irish themselves for their plight, instead of addressing the systemic issues at play. Relief efforts were often marred by corruption and mismanagement, and many Irish people were forced to emigrate to the United States and other countries in search of a better life.\n\nWhile the Great Hunger was a tragic and devastating event in Irish history, it also served as a catalyst for Irish nationalism and the fight for independence from British rule. The memory of the famine and the suffering endured by the Irish people continues to shape Irish identity and serves as a reminder of the need to address social and economic inequality.", "prompt_len": 515, "label": "gpt3re"}

During a supernova, a star's core collapses and releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light, heat, and other forms of radiation. This process can also create heavy elements, which are scattered throughout the universe and eventually become the building blocks of new stars, planets, and life forms. \n\nScientists study supernovae to better understand the physics of the universe and to trace the history of galactic evolution.

Low-level nuclear waste is the trash produced from cleaning materials and plant maintenance, similar to most industrial garbage with one difference; it's detectably radioactive. Low-level waste from nuclear plants is about equal in volume and radioactivity to the combined radioactive trash from hospitals, colleges, and research laboratories. On the other hand, high-level radioactive waste is a completely different story. This type of waste is made up of the used fuel rods from nuclear reactor systems. Although it only represents a small portion of all nuclear waste, it is significantly more hazardous than low-level waste due to its high levels of radioactivity and long half-life. This is why there is such a strong emphasis on the safe disposal of high-level waste, as it poses a potential health risk for tens of thousands of years.

{"text": "What leapt out at me first about The Great Dictator was the incredible way that Charlie Chaplin used music. One scene in particular contains a truly amazing matching of sound to visuals that is the equal of any routine put on by an Olympic gymnast, especially given that it was shot in a single take. Perhaps, given that this was 1940, coincidentally the year that Walt Disney released Fantasia, I should compare this talent to that of a world class animator, but Chaplin was constrained by the laws of physics. In the scene, Chaplin's character, a Jewish barber mistaken for the dictator of Tomania, is reluctantly tasked with giving a speech to a massive crowd. As he ascends to the podium, the military band begins to play a rousing march. Chaplin's character is visibly nervous, stumbling over his notes, and his initial attempts at speaking are drowned out by the brass section of the band.\n\nBut then, as the music fades to a softer section, Chaplin's character takes center stage. He begins to speak in a tentative voice, but the orchestra begins to swell in volume and intensity, driving him forward. As he gains confidence, the crowd becomes more and more animated, drawn in by the power of the music and the passion of Chaplin's performance.\n\nIt's a tour-de-force of filmmaking, a perfect convergence of visuals and sound that practically vibrates with energy. Chaplin's ability to harness the power of music for emotional effect was unparalleled, and this scene is one of his greatest achievements as a filmmaker.\n\nOverall, The Great Dictator is a masterful work of art that showcases Chaplin's immense talents as a performer, writer, and director. Even nearly eighty years after its release, it remains one of the most powerful movies ever made, a powerful testament to the strength of the human spirit in the face of tyranny and oppression.", "prompt_len": 511, "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "To better understand the aims of the Bauhaus school, one has to read the following extracts from Walter Gropius’ Manifesto: “The ultimate aim of all creative activity is a building! The decoration of buildings was once the noblest function of fine arts, and fine arts were indispensable to great architecture. Today, they exist in complacent isolation, and can only be rescued by the conscious cooperation and collaboration of all craftsmen. Architects, painters, and sculptors must once again come to grips with a common problem, and the lesser arts must be put in their place, subordinated to the primary purpose of architecture. The old division of work between the architect and the craftsman must be abolished, and a new teamwork must be developed. The whole will be built upon common feeling, upon a unifying idea. Much that has been excluded from previous art will be united in the new art.” \n\nGropius’ Manifesto emphasizes the importance of collaboration between all artists involved in the creation of a building. The fine arts of painting and sculpture should not exist in isolation but must be integrated into the architecture of a building, with the ultimate goal being the creation of a unified and cohesive work of art. The traditional hierarchy of craftsman and architect must be discarded in favor of a new, cooperative approach. The Bauhaus school aimed to break down the barriers between art and practicality, promoting the idea that design should serve a useful purpose while still being aesthetically pleasing. \n\nThis philosophy is reflected in the school’s curriculum and the works of its students and faculty. The Bauhaus approach to design influenced many other artistic movements of the early 20th century and continues to be an important influence in contemporary design. The idea of collaboration between different disciplines, and the integration of art and technology, remains a fundamental principle of modern design.", "prompt_len": 309, "label": "gpt3re"}

Some former Systematic Ornithologists (Peters, Moore) put as \"lumbers\" a lot of different species like Goldfinch, Greenfinches, Linnet and Redpoll into the same genus. Looking at that big genus we see that there is less homology, only the yellow wing marking. But with the advancements in molecular phylogenetics, it was found that Siskins are genetically more similar to certain species within the genus Spinus, such as the pine siskin and black-capped siskin, than they are to other species within the family Carduelidae. As a result, the genus Carduelis was split into multiple genera, with the Siskins being placed in the genus Spinus.\n\nThis reclassification has sparked much debate among ornithologists, with some arguing that the traditional classification system should be retained, while others support the new genetic-based classification.\n\nDespite the controversy, one thing is clear - Siskins are a fascinating and highly adaptable species, able to thrive in a wide range of environments from temperate forests to alpine tundras.

In this she is a little like Australia’s greatest living philosopher, Peter Singer, who (if I read him aright) once wrote that we should be as concerned about a preventable child death on the other side of the world as about one in our own town or street. Therefore if it cost $10,000 to save a child’s life in Australia, and that $10,000 could save 100 lives elsewhere, no matter where, Australians should spend the $10,000 on saving the lives elsewhere. This notion of equal concern for all humans is a controversial one, as some argue that we have a greater responsibility towards our own community and country. However, Miss Toynbee and Peter Singer's ideas challenge us to think beyond our own backyard and consider the global impact of our actions.\n\nIn the case of malaria, while it may not be a significant threat in developed countries like Britain or Australia, it continues to be a prevalent and deadly disease in many parts of the world.

The regiment also played a critical role in the Battle of Inkerman and the Siege of Sevastopol.\n\nAccounts of the 20th Foot's success often mention their use of a small talisman that soldiers carried with them into battle. The talisman was passed down from soldier to soldier, and it was believed to bring good luck and protection in battle.\n\nIt's unclear whether the talisman actually had any supernatural powers or if its power came from the soldiers' belief in it. However, it's undeniable that the soldiers of the 20th Foot believed in their luck and fought with a sense of invincibility that helped them achieve remarkable success.\n\nIf there is any truth to the concept of \"Luck,\" it may be found in the example of the 20th Foot.

{"text": "For a fixed earthquake size, the region of strong shaking can be an indication of the regional geologic structure. A particularly illuminating illustration of the effects of regional geology on earthquake shaking is presented in Figure 0-2. The region of damaging shaking is shown for two earthquakes with roughly the same size - the 1811 New Madrid earthquake and the 1906 California earthquake. In the case of the New Madrid earthquake, which struck in the Mississippi Valley region, the shaking was felt across a much larger area compared to the California earthquake. This is because the geology of the region is different - the Mississippi Valley region sits on relatively soft sedimentary rocks which amplify the shaking, while the California region has harder, more resistant bedrock which tends to absorb or scatter seismic waves. Additionally, the New Madrid earthquake produced a much longer period of shaking, which is also related to the regional geologic structure. These observations demonstrate the importance of understanding regional geology when assessing earthquake hazards and designing structures to withstand seismic forces. It is important to note that geologic structures can vary significantly even within small regions, so a thorough understanding of the local geology is critical for accurate earthquake hazard analysis.", "prompt_len": 396, "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "Another flightless bird, but this one was related to pigeons and doves; birds that really do fly. There is a story that goes with the Dodo bird becoming extinct. All Dodos lived on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. The story goes that sailors who visited the island would often stop by to hunt Dodos for food. The birds were slow-moving and didn't have any natural predators on the island, so they didn't know to fear humans. As a result, they were easy targets for the sailors. Unfortunately, the Dodo bird's population quickly declined and they became extinct in less than a century. Today, there are very few remains of the Dodo bird left in the world. However, their memory lives on and they serve as a symbol of human impact on the environment and the importance of preserving endangered species.", "prompt_len": 225, "label": "gpt3re"}

Some say that the star represented the wish of many Texans to achieve statehood in the United States. Others say it originally represented Texas as the lone state of Mexico which was attempting to uphold its rights under the Mexican Constitution of 1824. Regardless of its original meaning, the Lone Star flag soon became a symbol of Texas pride and identity, and it has remained so ever since. When Texas declared its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Lone Star flag was adopted as the official banner of the new Republic of Texas. It flew over battles and victories, and it was flown high when Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845, becoming the 28th state. \n\nToday, the Lone Star flag remains an iconic symbol of Texas. It is flown proudly over state buildings and homes, and it is often featured in logos and advertisements for Texas businesses. The design has also been incorporated into clothing, accessories, and other merchandise, allowing Texans and fans of the Lone Star State to show their love and support in style. Whether you see it waving in the wind or emblazoned on a t-shirt, the Lone Star flag represents the spirit, independence, and pride of Texas and its people.", "prompt_len": 379, "label": "gpt3re"}

Like Thatcher, he embraced the fiscal policies of neoliberalism without the more \" libertarian \" perspectives of the Chicago school on social issues . He favoured cuts to personal income tax and business tax, lower government spending , the dismantling of the centralised wage-fixing system, the abolition of compulsory trade unionism and the privatization of government-owned enterprises , views that have dominated his subsequent career. As a result of his strong adherence to Thatcherism, Howard implemented several significant economic policies during his time as Treasurer. He oversaw a series of income tax cuts, which saw both personal and business tax rates decrease substantially. Howard also began the process of privatizing many government-owned enterprises, selling off key assets such as Qantas and Telstra.\n\nHowever, Howard's economic policies were not without controversy. His government's push to deregulate the labor market led to widespread protests, as workers feared that the dismantling of the centralised wage-fixing system would leave them vulnerable to exploitation. Similarly, the abolition of compulsory trade unionism was met with opposition from both unions and social justice groups.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Howard remained committed to his economic vision. When he became Prime Minister in 1996, he continued to pursue policies of economic liberalization, implementing further tax cuts and expanding the privatization of government-owned assets. His legacy as a politician is closely tied to his role in shaping economic policy in Australia, and his adherence to Thatcherite principles continues to be influential in Australian politics today.", "prompt_len": 577, "label": "gpt3re"}

Sparta was known for its poetry and it pottery, its wares being found in places as far flung as Cyrene (in Libya) and the island of Samos, not far from the coast of modern-day Turkey. Researcher Konstantinos Kopanias notes in a 2009 journal article that, up until the sixth century B.C., Sparta appears to have had an ivory workshop. In addition to their artistic skills, the people of Sparta were also known for their military prowess. They had a highly organized and disciplined army, which was considered one of the most formidable in ancient Greece. The Spartan education system focused on training young boys in physical fitness and military tactics, with the goal of producing skilled soldiers who were willing to sacrifice themselves for their city-state.\n\nAs Sparta grew in power and influence, it began to expand its territory and exert its dominance over neighboring regions. By the fifth century B.C., Sparta was one of the leading city-states in Greece, alongside Athens and Thebes. The rivalry between Athens and Sparta would eventually lead to the Peloponnesian War, which lasted from 431-404 B.C. and resulted in Sparta emerging victorious.\n\nDespite its military success, Sparta was not as culturally or intellectually advanced as other city-states, such as Athens.

These in turn were fictionalised in a 1962 film, The 300 Spartans , which was on BBC2 yesterday. It’s not a film I can remember seeing before, and falls squarely into the typical swords and sandals epic feel. The film follows the basic plot of the Battle of Thermopylae, where King Leonidas led 300 Spartan soldiers into battle against the massive Persian army. Despite being outnumbered and ultimately defeated, the Spartans gained legendary status for their bravery and sacrifice. The 300 Spartans film, released in the same year as Lawrence of Arabia, typifies the mid-century fascination with ancient empires and heroic battles. However, it is the modern retelling through the graphic novel and subsequent film adaptations that capture the imagination of a new generation. The visual medium allows for an immersive experience that can more fully communicate the scale and intensity of the conflict. The graphic novel and film versions of 300, produced in the early 2000s, have become iconic representations of the Thermopylae story and have helped popularize the genre of historical epic in modern times.

I've never been a big fan of Two and a Half Men, but I've always appreciated its ability to attract a big audience, and to ultimately mutate and adapt in ways that barely make sense.

Schooled at Louth and by his father, a rector, he began to write early, and at the age of twelve he composed an epic of 6,000 lines. In 1828 he matriculated at Cambridge but only after the elder Tennyson had approved his recitation by heart of the odes of Horace. At Cambridge, Tennyson became friends with Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet, and the two attended lectures together and collaborated on literary projects. However, Hallam's sudden death in 1833 greatly impacted Tennyson, who struggled with depression and writer's block for several years.\n\nHe published his breakthrough work, \"Poems,\" in 1832, receiving mixed reviews from critics. However, he gained popularity with the success of \"In Memoriam A.H.H.,\" a collection of poems dedicated to Hallam. Tennyson was named Poet Laureate in 1850, succeeding William Wordsworth, and held the position until his death in 1892.\n\nDuring his tenure, Tennyson wrote several well-known works, including \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" and \"Idylls of the King.\" His poetry often explored themes of nature, mortality, and the human condition, and his works continue to be studied and admired today.", "prompt_len": 329, "label": "gpt3re"}

Montserrat is often referred to as the Emerald Isle of the Caribbean, due both to its resemblance to coastal Ireland and to the Irish descent of most of its early European settlers. Its population is just over 5,000, with the majority being of African descent. The island is also home to a large population of Irish descendants, who have made a significant cultural impact on the island.

{"text": "There are various factors that affect the Earth's albedo. One of these factors is the presence of reflective surfaces on Earth's surface, such as ice caps, snow, and clouds. These surfaces reflect a significant portion of the incoming solar radiation back into space, thereby reducing the amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth.\n\nAnother factor that affects Earth's albedo is the amount of vegetation present on the planet. Plants and trees absorb some of the incoming solar radiation, but they also reflect a significant portion back into space. The amount of vegetation on the planet can therefore affect the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth.\n\nHuman activities, such as deforestation and the expansion of urban areas, can also have an impact on Earth's albedo. When forests are cleared, for example, the amount of reflective vegetation in an area decreases, which can lead to an increase in the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth.\n\nAdditionally, the composition of the Earth's atmosphere can also affect its albedo. Certain atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, can absorb and trap solar radiation within the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a warmer planet with a lower albedo.\n\nOverall, understanding the factors that affect the Earth's albedo is important for predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change on our planet.", "prompt_len": 57, "label": "gpt3re"}

Since hereditary peers only make up a small portion of the House of Lords, the loss of even one member can have a significant impact on the balance of power.\n\nThe Alternative Vote system is used in these by-elections to ensure that the winning candidate has the support of a majority of the electorate. This means that voters rank the candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate wins a majority of first preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed according to the second preference of each voter.\n\nWhile some have criticized the hereditary peerage as undemocratic, it is an important part of the British political system.

{"text": "This somewhat lengthy quote is taken from a commentary on \"In the Lake of the Woods\" (Tim O'Brien). It provides a good link between the two books. In Lake, the flies are evil/Satan, always there during the Mai Lai experience in Vietnam; they are the presence of Satan. Similarly, in \"The Poisonwood Bible,\" the presence of evil is also associated with nature - the Congo jungle and its inhabitants. The protagonist, Nathan Price, sees the jungle and its people as savage and godless, and tries to impose his own religious beliefs on them. However, as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that it is Nathan himself who is blinded by his own arrogance and ignorance, and who ultimately brings about his own downfall. The novel also reveals how the Congo's beauty and power can provide both salvation and destruction, and how it is ultimately up to individuals to choose how to confront the forces of nature and evil within themselves.", "prompt_len": 268, "label": "gpt3re"}

This was followed by a series of tours by American rock and roll artists including Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Jerry Lee Lewis. These tours brought a new sound and style to the UK, which was quickly adopted by British artists. This fusion of American rock and British beat led to the creation of the 'British Invasion' sound, which dominated the charts and airwaves throughout the Sixties. The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, and The Kinks all emerged during this time, and their music and style shaped the cultural landscape of the decade.

{"text": "  Although the Industrial Revolution had started perhaps       75 years earlier with the coming of water-powered cotton mills       such as Cromford, Derbyshire (1771), the United Kingdom's most       successful economic period was doubtless in Victorian times. The railways of Brunel and others spread nationwide, innovative       machines, products and processes of all kinds were developed,       plus of course the expansion of influence worldwide through the       creation of the British Empire. Whilst much of this development       would not be acceptable today, at that time there were many who       benefited from the generation of great wealth, sometimes to the       benefit of the working class, but of course, sometimes not. Nonetheless, the Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in Britain's economy, society, and politics. With the growth of industries, jobs became available, and people migrated from rural areas to urban centers in search of work. This led to the rise of the working-class, which often suffered from poor working conditions, low wages, and no job security. To address these issues, trade unions were formed, and labor laws were passed, which provided some protections for workers. \n\nMoreover, the growth of industry also led to advancements in science and technology. Innovations in transportation, such as the steam engine and the railway system, facilitated faster and more efficient movement of goods and people across the country. This, in turn, fueled the growth of commerce and trade. Other innovations, such as the power loom and spinning jenny, revolutionized the textile industry, making it a major driver of economic growth.\n\nWhile the Industrial Revolution had significant positive impacts, it also had negative consequences. The rise of factories and the mass production system had a severe impact on the environment, with pollution and waste becoming major concerns. The working-class also faced numerous hardships, including poor living conditions, inadequate sanitation, and increased exposure to disease.\n\nIn summary, the Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes to Britain's economy, society, and politics. As with any historical event, there were both positive and negative consequences, but its impact on Britain and the world cannot be overstated. The innovations, advancements, and processes developed during this era continue to shape modern-day economies and industries.", "prompt_len": 739, "label": "gpt3re"}

{"text": "It’s long known that wooden barrels will ultimately change the characteristics of any liquid within, with the climate surrounding varying the degrees of flavours produced. This process was stumbled upon when wine use to be transported by sea, being exposed to the elements whilst being stored on deck. The long journeys meant that the wine carried a deeper flavour profile and colour compared to its original state, something that Joseph Noilly, a herbalist, wanted to take full advantage of. So, in 1813, Noilly started experimenting with aging wine in wooden barrels, observing the effects of the ageing process on the liquid. He soon realized that different types of wood had varying effects on the wine and started blending his wines with different amounts of barrel-aged wine to create the perfect combination of flavours.\n\nNoilly's experiment was a huge success, and his wines became highly sought after. Today, the process of ageing wine in wooden barrels is a widely accepted practice, used by winemakers all over the world to enhance the flavour profiles of their wines.\n\nWhile wooden barrels are still the traditional method of ageing wine, modern technology has allowed winemakers to experiment with other materials, such as steel, concrete, and clay, which also have an impact on the flavour profile of the wine.\n\nHowever, despite the advances in technology, many winemakers still prefer the traditional wooden barrel, believing that it is the best way to achieve the desired flavour profile in their wines. And so, while the practice of ageing wine in barrels may have originated out of necessity, it has become an art form in itself, with winemakers continuing to experiment with different combinations of wood, length of ageing, and climate to create the perfect wine.", "prompt_len": 492, "label": "gpt3re"}

The vaccines are typically given in a series of two or three shots over six months to individuals between the ages of 9 and 45. However, it is recommended that individuals receive the vaccine before becoming sexually active as it is most effective before exposure to the virus.\n\nOne concern that has been raised about HPV vaccines is the potential for adverse reactions, but these are typically mild and short-lived. Some individuals may experience symptoms such as fever, headache, and nausea, but severe allergic reactions are extremely rare. Additionally, the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, especially when considering the long-term consequences of HPV infections.\n\nDespite the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine, there are still barriers to access for certain populations. This is particularly true for low-income individuals and those living in countries with inadequate healthcare systems.

Only around four percent of Boy Scouts ever achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, making it a rare and prestigious achievement. The award also unlocks many doors for future opportunities, including scholarships, job opportunities, and leadership positions. Even after a scout becomes an Eagle, they are still encouraged to continue their involvement in scouting and give back to their community.", "prompt_len": 328, "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "Because of concern about Hyacinthoides non-scripta coming      under pressure in the wild, the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside      Act makes it a protected plant and the legislation was further      enhanced in 1998 making it an offence to trade in wild      Hyacinthoides non-scripta bulbs or seeds. The difficulty of      proving that a Hyacinthoides non-scripta bulb is not from a wild      source means that only the Spanish bluebell is sold by garden      centres. It is said that the Hyacinthoides hispanica was first      introduced to the UK in the 17th century so the measures taken      in the late 20th century can’t be wholly to blame for the      dominance of the Spanish bluebell in the commercial market. However, the fact remains that the Spanish bluebell is more aggressive than the native bluebell and quickly takes over areas where they are both present, threatening the survival of the native species. In addition, many people are unaware of the difference between the two species and plant them both together in gardens, further aiding the spread of the Spanish bluebell. Efforts have been made to promote the importance of preserving the native bluebell, and some organizations have even launched campaigns encouraging people to remove Spanish bluebells from their gardens and replace them with native ones. While these efforts may be slow in reversing the damage already done, they are crucial in ensuring the survival of one of the UK's most iconic and beloved wildflowers.", "prompt_len": 718, "label": "gpt3re"}
{"text": "As the Civil War began, poorer farmers were generally indifferent to questions of slavery and states' rights. The slaveholding planters held the most political power, however, and after some hesitation, Arkansas seceded (1861) from the Union. In the Civil War, Confederate defeats at Pea Ridge (Mar., 1862), Prairie Grove (Dec., 1862), and Arkansas Post (Jan., 1863) led to Union occupation of N Arkansas, and General Grant's Vicksburg campaign separated states W of the Mississippi from the rest of the Confederacy. Even though Arkansas was part of the Confederacy, opposition to the war increased as the conflict dragged on and casualties mounted. The state was rocked by internal divisions, with some Arkansans even forming Confederate desertion and Unionist guerrilla groups. The war in Arkansas finally ended in May 1865, with the Union military successfully navigating the state's navigable waterways and railroads to cut off key resources and infrastructure. Despite this setback, Arkansas emerged from the Civil War with a very different social and economic landscape, one dominated by labor-intensive, large-scale commercial farming operations that displaced small farmers and even forced some into debt peonage. The state also had to grapple with the post-war reality that the South's slave-based, agrarian economy was no longer viable, and had to find new economic and social models to rebuild.", "prompt_len": 516, "label": "gpt3re"}
