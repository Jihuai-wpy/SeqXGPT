{"text": "This early Biograph short was so much fun to watch. I loved the dancing on the moving train. We have a few of these dance films on the Biograph disc, but they aren't in as good a condition, and the subjects in them are rather dull. The action in this one is just too funny. Not knowing much about trains, I had a little trouble following everything about the switch that was going on while they moved from New York to Washington! The ending was the best. The film seems to have been preserved in a bad (almost) print, which made every lighted scene very grainy, and made for an overall \"darkish\" presentation. I can't complain, though. If it had been a better copy, I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. I found myself laughing out loud at the dance footage, and really feeling for the young girl in the carriage. Her reaction to being told that everyone on the carriage is going to have the night off was great! I'll have to keep the lookout for another film on trains.\nI also watched a 35mm. print of Charles Dickenson's 1913 film The Seventh Day. Although it's from 1913, it seems to have more recent qualities to it- something that I think is unique to Biograph films- which is that everything seems larger. Maybe it's because of the graininess that I noticed a difference between that and the usual standard of film from the same time period. Anyway, I really enjoyed watching the film, and was impressed with the special effects. It was a great story too. Although I would have liked to see more, it was good to just watch the scenes that were available without interruption. It's very hard for me to say what else I liked about it, because there are a lot of good things to say about it. I enjoyed the beginning when the father is writing his will and his wife has to leave the house. Of course, the \"real\" wife ends up coming back, but with the daughter instead!\nAt least I know that both of the films I watched are going to end up being reels from this collection.\nFor whatever reasons, I always enjoy watching the comedy shorts more than the other Biograph films. I must say though, this isn't the strongest of them all. I don't know what it is, but just as I am enjoying the scene with the little boy being tutored, his father comes to the door, and interrupts the scene. Not that things couldn't have been interupted, but there just doesn't seem to be a nice way to end the scene. The little boy was just so cute though! The main scene on the street was great too, and I was glad to watch it again as well. The father was quite funny. The scene in the garden was nice too. There was some very good camerawork in this particular film, and I enjoyed watching it again. I'll try the next short on the 587 reel- or is it 586... whatever, it's the first one on the trolley.", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "myasthenia gravis ( mg ) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by varying degrees of weakness of the skeletal muscles of the body due to a break down in communication between the nerves that control the muscles and the muscles themselves. the muscle weakness associated with mg is usually most marked in the skeletal muscles, particularly the eyes, face, and throat.\nwhat causes mg is still unknown, although it is estimated to occur in approximately 20 to 30 per 100,000 u.s. population in the general population. it is frequently seen in women and often runs in families.\nif left untreated mg can, and in some instances does, result in the loss of muscle strength and a gradual disability. although it is not a specific disease, clinical features similar to those found in mg were noted a few decades ago with the first cases of mg now known to develop from long-term inhalation of organic solvents (eg, paint thinners, paint strippers ), which suggests environmental exposures may be contributing to the development of mg (see below for more information on organic solvent myopathy 0sm ).\nthe term myasthenia gravis comes from the greek words \"myo\" (meaning \"muscle\") and \"asthenia\" (meaning \"weakness\") and was coined by werner heimlich, a german internist, in 1945.\nmyasthenia gravis usually runs a chronic course with intermittent periods of exacerbation and remission. however, myasthenia gravis can at times progress to a severely debilitating condition. more than 90 percent of mg patients have antibodies against the receptor of the nerve to muscle connection, however, some have been reported that have no antibodies. although a definitive diagnostic test for myasthenia gravis is still elusive, an eye examination provides one of the earliest clues to its presence and suggests the diagnosis.\nmyasthenia gravis is usually diagnosed based on a thorough clinical evaluation followed by diagnostic tests.\nmyasthenia gravis is a systemic disorder with widespread symptoms. the muscles that are most severely affected are those serving the eyes, eyelids, head, and tongue.\nthe muscles in the face, throat, or jaw can droop on one side of the body, and sometimes the voice can sound weak and the eyes can droop as well. the most common symptom of mg is weakness and fatigue of the muscles responsible for eye and eyelids movements. this weakness may interfere with speaking, chewing, swallowing, and even breathing. because of the weak oral muscles of the mouth, eating solid food and drinking from a cup are difficult.\nother common symptoms include headache, general tiredness, pain, difficulty breathing, difficulty walking, dry mouth or mild thirst (a result of a reduced ability of the mouth to produce saliva), and double vision, blurred vision, or changes in vision.\nsome patients may notice that their neck is stiff. or their arms may feel weak or heavy. mg is rarely, if ever, a life-threatening disorder. however, because myasthenia can weaken the muscles required for breathing, mild or even severe symptoms may be present that can create breathing problems that may lead to difficulty breathing. however, most myasthenia patients rarely have difficulty breathing.\nsymptoms of mg tend to worsen during the day, and improve during the night. most patients with myasthenia gravis have moderate to severe muscle weakness that improves slightly after 6 to 8 hours of sleep.\nphysical therapy may be required if there is weakness in the arms or neck muscles, muscle cramps, leg muscle weakness, or problems swallowing.\nmyasthenia gravis can sometimes be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. however, the diagnosis can sometimes be confused with a wide range of other neurological conditions with similar symptoms.\nphysical examination sometimes suggests myasthenia gravis, but it is rarely 100 percent conclusive. most patients presenting with symptoms of mg appear normal, but may have diminished facial expressions on the affected side due to weakness of the orbicularis oculi muscle, and may notice a droopy eye lid ( ptosis ) and eyelid retraction. in addition", "label": "llama"}

Snapchat received only 0.6% of the total advertising spend on social networking sites - and Facebook now wants some of that to be on its own platform rather than third-party apps.\nSnapchat's IPO could raise $53.1m (£45.1m) at an estimated valuation of $24bn (£20.2bn), according to the Financial Times.\nMajor investors in Snapchat include Tiger Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital.\nSnapchat has been criticized for what users perceive to be its closed nature to developers - preventing them creating their own applications built on its API but also because it refuses to share user data, and prevents users from saving videos from their account to their phone.\nAlthough these could be seen as advantages to the company, it could also make some of the larger tech firms think twice about entering agreements with Snapchat's parent, Snap, Inc.", "label": "llama"}

The set of all such left invariant vector fields will be denoted by \\textbf{T} (not the tangent vector field). By the Theorem on Lie Groups, we will only consider left invariant vector fields $x-a.g_{0}$, where $x^{i}-a.g_{0}^{i}\\in\\textbf{T}.G_{i}$, and $i=2,...,n$.

{"text": "In most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction at the end of the power stroke and enters the cylinder to complete the power stroke. This reversal reduces the time the steam spends in the cylinder, allowing it to increase the time steam spends at high temperature and high pressure for better steam engine work.\nIn some types of engines, the steam does not change direction, it simply moves into an adjacent cylinder to be used again in the next power stroke. As the piston and steam are in different cylinder in the next stroke, no reversal of the direction of the steam is necessary.\nIt is common to have multiple cylinders in one bank of power pistons. In some designs, the first piston in the bank reverses the steam. The steam then moves into the next cylinder, also part of the bank, where it continues to expand, driven by pressure from the steam in the two previous cylinders. The steam moves in succession from the first cylinder to the second to the third, and is exhausted in the last cylinder. When the engine is working at full speed, each cylinder only sees steam from the previous cylinder. It does not see the fresh supply from the nozzle until the steam has had time to expand in the cylinder. It is common to have more cylinders in this design than in the previous one, but the method is the same.\nIt is also common to build two sets of cylinders with the same number of cylinders. As in the case of one bank of cylinders, the steam is supplied to cylinder 1, then moves to cylinder 2, then cylinder 3, and so forth. In this case, a bank of two cylinders is installed, one behind the other. Piston 1 is always on piston 1. The steam enters cylinder 1 for the first half of the power stroke expansion, then moves to cylinder 2 for the rest of the stroke. When the engine is at full speed, cylinders 3 and 4 will see steam from cylinders 2 and 1 during this engine cycle.\nIt is also important to take account of the space constraints for steam engines. For an engine with six cylinders, it would be possible to have one set of three cylinders all in one bank of power cylinders. You could have three cylinders, one in the front and one on each side of the front two cylinders. The first cylinder would work on half the stroke, then when it was working on the first part of the power stroke, both cylinders on the same side together and then both the rear pistons together. In this case, the steam will travel the space between cylinders three and four, as well as from the front cylinder to the rear cylinders. The engine must be sufficiently long, with plenty of space between cylinders.\nFinally, it must be said that some steam engines have only one steam cylinder. Some are even two-stroke engines. In this case, the steam reverses or not to reverse as necessary (or not) for the application.", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "In sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese, but with enough good moments to make this an average episode overall. I'm glad I watched the series in three seasons, as to avoid having to endure such dreck when it could have been avoided.\nThe title refers to something the young woman, the daughter of the murdered minister, says in response to the questioning of one of the detectives. She claims that her mother is alive, and that the woman, who she has seen in secret, has the power to tell the good from the bad and to reveal the truth to everybody else.\nThere's some good stuff here, like the fact that the police try to find the witnesses to the crimes and question them. I like it that they actually go door-to-door, just like what they did in the old days of the series, when there weren't any computers.\nWe also get to watch an interrogation of a suspect by one of those famous detectives, who is good at his work, and who seems to be an expert in the field. I'm not sure if his name is mentioned in this episode, however, but he's clearly a famous guy, and I like seeing him in action.\nThe episode contains one scene where a suspect tries to frame one of the investigators. Of course, this is done in a way that leaves a clear trail, and where he isn't entirely successful in covering up for himself. Still, it's fun to see the detective in action, who is quick enough to uncover the lies and eventually finds his way.\nThe whole series works perfectly fine if you just try to forget the first two seasons, and you keep your expectations to a minimum.

{"text": "The university experienced its share of student unrest during the Vietnam War in the 1970s.\nNevertheless, the student body remained remarkably politically inactive through the Nixon years. Only in the mid-1980s did students begin to express themselves as an organized political force. A presidential commission, established by Harvard University during the Nixon-Kissinger years, recommended the creation of an \"academic community.\" The idea was to encourage students, faculty, and staff to express their individual as well as collective identities and to create an integrated, rather than segregated, academic community.\nIn 1987 student petitions resulted in the creation of a Committee on Racial and Ethnic Affairs, which monitored the representation of underrepresented groups in classes and employment. Faculty members voted to institute a program of hiring in racial and ethnic \"diversity.\" In the spring of 1989, an unranked faculty-initiated strike occurred around faculty wage demands and the university's need to hire permanent faculty to fill vacant positions. Students and faculty expressed fear that new programs and services intended to achieve minority recruitment would adversely affect standards, and called for greater faculty involvement in review. In 1990, the university established an Assistant Provost for Academic Support. The purpose of the initiative was to increase academic support services to disadvantaged students and to raise standards for the recruitment of students enrolled in a variety of nontraditional admission programs. Since 1980, the university has made a special effort to recruit underrepresented students. In 2003, the university launched a $2.3-billion endowment campaign. African American, Jewish, Asian Pacific Islander, and Latino students received an average of $890 million annually from grants and scholarships provided by the federal government, state governments, and private organizations. In 1998, Latinos enrolled at the university received $11.8 million in federal student aid monies. In addition to offering 43 scholarships to historically black colleges and universities in the 2001–2002 academic year, the university contributed almost $1 billion to African American students nationwide in the same academic year. In 1999 the university announced an addition of 12 new programs to its 280-degree program. The programs were designed for students who do not want to attend college full time. These programs require two years in either the military or a community college while at the same time satisfying certain requirements needed for a degree from the university.\nThe university has 22 graduate and professional schools. Its 18 museums and the extensive University Library System are key resources for research and scholarly work. The library system is regarded as the largest academic library in the United States and the fourth largest library in the world. The libraries hold over 15 million volumes on 11.9 million volumes of shelving. The University Archives collection documents the institution's history, including the records of the early presidencies and those of faculty, administrators, committees and their subcommittes, organizations, and departments.\nDartmouth has a large international student population, with 13 percent of students coming from Africa, Asia, South America, Central America, or the Caribbean. In 1995–1996 Dartmouth had a total enrollment of 4,950 undergraduate students and 2,360 graduate students. The university operates its own television stations, radio stations, and an off-campus farm.

The mission of the Kline Farm was to provide an inclusive and nurturing environment where children of all races and creeds could participate actively in all aspects of farm life.\nThe Kline Farm began with 26 African American children and was directed by Mrs. Faye H. Wilson. In 1963, she assumed all responsibilities for direction and leadership of the farm. The 50 children attending the Kline Farm were cared for by 7 women with an average age of 30. The children ranged in age from 6 months to 17 years. Each of the women lived at the Kline Farm, worked at one of the local stores, and attended Hidden Hills Baptist Church with 2 of the women serving as the church organist and pianist.\nWilson worked with the state on implementing the child and adult food stamp program for the farm and in 1964, the Kline Farm was the first farm in the United States to be approved as an adult food stamp project. The state approved $475 a year to feed the 50 children daily. This was one the first food assistance programs serving any rural area in Dade County. In 1965, the child food stamp program became state law with the Kline Farm participating as well.\nIn 1968, the Kline Farm received a $15,000 grant from the National Agriculture Trust Fund for the construction of a barn for storing vegetable crops. The farm was also named a USDA Farmer in Schools Project, the only agricultural project in the state of Florida to be so designated.\nIn 1967, a fire destroyed a barn full of animal feed. The Kline Farm was unable to recover from the lack of supplies and equipment to feed animals during the construction of a new barn and animal feeding facility. Due to inactive land development, the Kline Farm could not survive with the limited funding from the state. By 1969, the 7 farmers and staff of the Kline Farm found a new home at the South Florida State Farm, Northwest Agricultural School in Belle Glade, Florida operated by the Division of Extension of the University of Florida.\nBetty Brown Ewell had been a member of the Baptist Student Union while attending classes at Tampa Baptist University, then attended Union Bible College where she graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in music. Betty was the assistant director of the Kline Farm. The University of Florida hired Ewell to be the head of youth activities on the Belle Glade farms and to serve as a farm educator at the Belle Glade Farms.\nAs Assistant Director of the Kline Farm in 1969, Betty Brown Ewell was responsible, along with another farm administrator, for the day to day operations of 56 farmers. At that time, the Kline Farm was one of four operational farms in the South Florida State Farm. Betty Brown Ewell was also a teacher of piano in the Belle Glade School District.\nIn 1970, the Belle Glade Farms (the South Florida State Farm) was reorganized by the University of Florida and the Florida Department of Agriculture into the Belle Glade Farms Cooperative.\nThe Belle Glade area was an agricultural producer of citrus fruits for the entire nation. The Kline Farm, in its new location and position as a member of the Belle Glade Cooperative was well positioned to provide agricultural education and research on a larger scale. The new farm community location on the edge of a major citrus grove provided ready access to equipment and supplies.\nDuring the 1970’s, Betty Brown Ewell served as a Belle Glade Farms Board member, a Florida Department of Agriculture Farm Advisory Committee member, and an extension specialist working under the direction of the University of Florida in extension education, teaching, and conducting agricultural research to the 500 acre farm community.\nBetty’s leadership role also included the implementation of the Cooperative’s “Family Agriculture Development Program,” and the Cooperative’s “Heifer Project.” After her service to the Belle Glade Cooperative, Betty Brown Ewell went on to accept a position with the University of Florida/County Cooperative Extension Service in Dade County.

The weighted-sum test statistic is a natural candidate for threshold testing, because it can be computed very rapidly.

{"text": "during the early stage of the avian influenza a(h7n9 ) infection in china in 2014-15. further experimental infection studies are needed to understand the roles of the other viral proteins and the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis.\nwe analyzed the effect of different concentrations of cholesterol on mtt [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. cholesterol was found to be a potent inhibitor of mtt reduction in all cell lines studied. in eca-109 and a549 cells, cholesterol inhibited mtt reduction mainly via induction of apoptosis. in huhmcv3a cells, however, cholesterol decreased mtt reduction by inhibiting cell proliferation. in rl9 (e-cadherin-transfected eca-109 cells), cholesterol inhibited mtt reduction through increasing the intracellular calcium [ca2+] and the expression levels of interleukin (il)-1β [il-1β], interleukin (il)-8 [il-8], and tumor necrosis factor α [tnf-α]. therefore, we suggest that the reduction of proliferation mediated by cholesterol in cancer cells with a high propensity for invasion is more important than the apoptotic effect of cholesterol in other cancer cells. these findings are likely to be relevant for developing cholesterol-lowering drugs for cancer treatment.\nmitochondrial targeting sequence-directed de novo antisense oligonucleotides (mtdnas) are an emerging class of drugs that have demonstrated in vivo efficacy in mouse disease models characterized by defects or perturbations of mitochondrial function. these studies suggest that dna-encoded mtdnas can mitigate deleterious effects of mitochondrial disease by restoring respiratory complexity or modulating gene expression. recently, mitochondrial dysfunction of nonspecific etiology has been implicated in a number of human diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular conditions, and atherosclerosis. targeting this mitochondrial dysfunction is a promising strategy for drug discovery to treat disease. we recently reported that mtdnas can reverse the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by statin-induced impaired mitochondrial function. here, we expand upon these observations and use clinically relevant models of human statin-treated atherosclerosis (a mouse model with endothelial dysfunction) and type i diabetes mellitus (an insulin-resistant model with mitochondrial dysfunction) to explore the therapeutic potential of mtdnas for treating metabolism-disrupted conditions. treatment with mtdnas resulted in significant improvements in blood glucose and insulin levels. these improvements were associated with reductions in intracellular ca2+, and improvements in blood sugar and insulin were completely restored with the addition of antioxidants to mtdna treatment. additionally, this group of compounds protected from death insulin-secreting beta cells, which are vulnerable to oxidative stress compounded by high glucose. lastly, we found that mtdnas improved blood glucose, insulin, and lipid levels via the mitochondria-mediated inhibition of endothelial foam cell formation.\nthe recent clinical observation that the expression of the microRNA miR-103/107 decreases in metastatic colorectal cancer (mcco) has led to intense investigation of its function and regulation. miR-103/107 levels are generally under the control of epigenetic modification and transcriptional regulation, so we hypothesized that miR-103/107 may bind to its target sites near a cpG site in pre-mrna and that the demethylation of cpG in promoter regions of mrna regulatory genes may affect its expression. however, only 1 of 13 genes that contain a cg island in the 3-untranslated region (3-utr) was found to be a strong regulator of miR-10", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "A Brother's Promise is a wonderful family film. This is a rare movie that both the parents and the kids will like. In fact, I think this film would appeal to just about any age group. It's a feel good story with a great message. This was a very entertaining film that I just thoroughly enjoyed and didn't want it to end. I found it to be quite a good movie...I'm glad to have seen it.\nThe story is about two brothers, Paul (David Nibley) and Michael (A.J. Trauth). It is told in short segments about their life. It is a wonderful story of brotherly love and of two lives that were destined to intersect in an unexpected way. The lives of the two brothers as children parallel each other throughout their formative years. After a while you get to know them quite well and you're drawn into their story. From the moment they meet, these two brothers become inseparable, their lives as adults will intersect with surprising results. In fact, one of these brothers will make a promise to another brother, a promise he keeps for almost fifty years.\nOne day in their early childhood they watch as a young man is arrested on several accounts. The young man is placed under house arrest for a time and the two brothers befriend him. They learn that the young man is a musician and they like him for that reason, plus they are drawn to him for some reason they could not explain. The two brothers invite him to move in when the court order expires. One of the promises made was that they would move in with him for a time to help him get his feet back on the ground. They never saw him again after his house arrest was over until they were adults.\nThe main character in this story is Michael. He becomes a successful lawyer who makes his living in the corporate world. The other brother, Paul, becomes a musician and lives a bohemian life. Of course they don't see each other in all those years, so there is less interaction in the film between the brotherly pair. At some point, Paul and his wife are divorced and he winds up living with a girlfriend (Dylan Neal). Michael's marriage ends tragically and he is left with a little boy, Jake (Miles Chandler) whose mother just abandoned the lad, with no reason. Jake takes a liking to Paul and Paul to Jake.\nSeveral years pass and Paul's girlfriend makes an announcement...she is carrying a baby. At this point, Paul is now a successful musician and his girlfriend's brother works for his music company. They want Paul to name the baby, but he wants more information of his girlfriend's family. That's when he discovers that Michael is Jake's dad and is living in Los Angeles.\nNow the story becomes a love story between Paul and Michael's sister, Melissa (Eliza Dushku), a nurse practitioner who just started her own practice and a doctor she consults with on some of the cases (Scott Gibson). She's a doctor with a busy schedule. She and Paul also share a special bond...they are more like brother and sister than most siblings. She and Paul go on a wild goose chase to find Michael to tell him that he has a son. It becomes a family thing involving both Paul and Melissa's families, since Michael's sister has been trying to get in touch with her missing brother also and wants to see her nephew and niece. What a story!\nIt has some wonderful storytelling that makes it a film to remember. It has a lot of depth to the story (a little long), but it's worth the time spent on it, it's definitely worth seeing. The end of this film will make a lot of people cry...not at the sad part but the way the film is wrapped up. It has wonderful scenes involving the dog...I found those to be quite touching.\nThe acting of the two brothers, Paul and Michael, is exceptional. AJ Trauth does a wonderful job in the role. He gives a performance that is very endearing and believable. David Nibley does a very good job in this film. The actress that played the part of Melissa was a joy to see. I really loved the way she acted in this film. She has a nice personality, plus is a terrific actress. I loved the way she stood up to the doctor that just didn't listen to her and the way she handled things with her family. There are more characters in this film that have other roles. Each of the actors brings something special to their part(s).\nThis is a wonderful family movie", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "Strings and RepresentationsHello. My name is Austin Bingham, and welcome to Algebra and Trigonometry, The Right Course. In today's chapter, we are going to talk about representations of lines by vectors. And we are going to do this in a geometrical way. So, I have this line here. And, I want to know how can I talk about this line mathematically. Well, one obvious way is, first of all, let's see, what's this line look like. It's just a straight line. So, it's just a straight thing. So, mathematically, I can use the same straight line symbol, \".\" That basically looks just like that, that just looks like a straight line, \".\" So, \"i\" is a point on this line, and \"j\" is a point on this line. So, I have \"i\" and \"j.\" And what I really want to do is talk about is what happens when I go from one to the other. So, if I think of going from one to the other by going over here, this distance over here is what I'm going to talk about. So, I have some of those numbers, then I'm going to add them together. And that distance is the thing that I have right here. And I'm going to talk about some of the things that are going to happen for that. So, we are going to start off by talking about some of the properties that we know for real numbers. And what I mean by that, is we know, for instance, that if I think of something as being less than something, I can say, \"oh, well, if it's less than, it's not equal to it.\" Which is, you can say, \"oh, well, if 5 is less than three.\" Well, then, by definition, that means that three is not equal to 5. And if it's less than it's also greater than it. If I say that this is less than this, well, I mean, I can say \"oh, well, well this is less than this because this is greater than it.\" So, we are going to want to say that if I'm dealing with distances I can say \"oh, well, if it's greater than this distance, then it's less than this distance.\" And if this distance is less than this distance, then we can say this one is greater than this one. And if this distance is greater than this distance, then this one is greater than this one. And what that's saying is, \"if distance a is greater than distance b, then distance a is also greater than distance b.\" It's talking about \"if and only if.\" So, I want to say, \"well, if I'm talking about the relationship between these things, this one's greater than this one, this one's greater than this one, but not both of them are equal to.\" Well, that's the if and only if rule. So, that's going to be some use of the order of addition, which is \"if you are using things together, you use 'then' and 'only if'\" you have to use 'then' right before 'then'. So, if I am doing a math problem with if and only if, I'm not saying I want to get to the thing I was getting to, I'm saying \"this is how you get there.\" So, that is telling you how the different parts go together. And you are using this thing \"then\" when you are going to have this part or these parts here and you have to use the other part here that's going to tell you how it got to get there, if you follow that sense of what this looks like. So, I've been talking about if a thing is less than another thing, you are talking about being greater than the other thing, you use the word \"then only if.\" And I want to mention too, in parentheses over here, that there's sort of, as you know, as you look at the work over your whole life, you see things that don't go as simply as we are telling you here. So, if I say, \"oh, well, suppose this, then I do that.\" I might do that, I might not do that. This is not a guarantee. It's just a tendency. And I have to be really careful about that, because it is not a guarantee. I might say \"okay, so if this line is less than this line, well okay, I'll do this. But if for some reason I can't do that, maybe I had a really bad slip of the tongue and what I really meant to do is do that. So, what happens if I get to this position \"", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "The last glacial ran from ~74,000 (BP = Before Present), up until ~20,000 BP.\nI am most certainly NOT a scientist or climate researcher.\nAll information is taken from what I have read, I.e. in newspapers, the Internet, and here on this web site.\nI have a natural curiosity as to how the world and its people evolve. Climate change is a fact of this natural history.\nPeople do not and cannot change it.\nThe fact that the earth has had warm cycles and iced cycles throughout its history.\nHowever, people try to blame their fellow man, even though the climate is driven by natural occurrences. For example, all the glaciers at the North and South Poles, along with all the mountains and valleys and all the animals and vegetation. These changes all have to do with the orbit and axis of the earth.\nWhat has been and will be are simple acts of nature.\nThese glacial periods are the natural fluctuations of our Mother Earth.\nThat's why people call them cyclical.\nThousands of years from now, there will be different cycles. Maybe even an ice age.\nClimate researchers claim that these are caused by greenhouse gasses. How can we blame something that is not caused by us?\nThere are so many false assumptions and statements from the people who study this topic that we, as the people who are the most affected by its consequences, have to start questioning the reliability of these claims.\nI'm only a humble journalist, in a way, because I am interested in finding things out and researching them. I ask questions.\nBut do I have all the answers? Of course not. I'm only trying to make sense of this whole 'climate change' issue.\nWhat I am trying to say is this: it's complicated.\nI'll give you a for instance: How come, in some areas of Denmark, you will step out of your house in a T-shirt in January and be warm, and in other parts of Denmark, it is so cold that you get frostbite in the same month?\nIs there any connection to the climate and its changes?\nWhy does climate research blame humanity for the changing climate?\nWhat are the facts and what's just the propaganda?\nI am a human being too, after all.\nIn 1884, climatologist and meteorologist William Ferrel created a model of atmospheric motion which was called 'Ferrel's Law'. It is a set of equations describing the behaviour of atmospheric masses (cloud, air, moisture, etc) around the world.\nAtmospheric physics is not my field, as I pointed out in the previous article.\nBut the idea of the 'global circulation' - which is the circulating pattern of gases, air and moisture on the planet - seemed to make sense.\nIt seems to correspond with what climatologists are saying now. Like, that the gases in the atmosphere can trap heat in the atmosphere so our polar ice caps will melt.\nI guess it is a model of how our gassy atmosphere works. It seems like common sense.\nOne thing this model does not include is humans, though.\nAnd that is what seems a little fishy to me. Because if a large part of our climate changes have to do with human activity, what is the point of not including people in the model?\nThere are a lot of people on this planet, and a lot of people emit gases into the atmosphere. So why not let them in?\nMaybe Ferrel could not include people back then. Maybe the amount of gassy emissions from human bodies was too small to be detected?\nAt the present moment, carbon dioxide emissions from mankind is thought to be at around 400,000,000 metric tons, or 400 million, per year.\nThis equals 1100 million tons per year, just of this certain gas. We are talking about a gas that, according to climatologists, has such a drastic effect on our greenhouse effect - that can be measured by its chemical formula, CO2 = 12O + 6C.\nIn 1820, the year the Industrial Revolution started, mankind was still at about 100 million tons CO2 per year, which was the level for the last 10,000 years, according to climatologists.\nSo people were emitting CO2 for thousands of years, but not long enough to have left any effects on the climate.\n", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "Rural Affairs Secretary Fergus Ewing wrote to Colin Kennedy on the 26th August as he explained:\n“I am replying to your email dated 30th July in which you raised concerns about the effect that the introduction of a new charging structure would have on local communities.”\n“You were particularly anxious that the new parking permit concessions, which became available in July 2013, should be continued for as long as possible.”\n“My officials have been in contact with a number of rural car parks concerned, and have consulted the wider public about the arrangements. I am grateful to you for raising this matter with me.”\n“I note that you are very keen to see the new parking system that took effect on 30th July 2012 rolled back to October 2011. Unfortunately rolling it back in time would involve a significant cost for the local authority and it is also, and importantly, difficult to change the arrangements as they are set out in legislation.”\n“I am advised that the Scottish Chartered Institute of Highways and Transportation has also provided their detailed cost analysis of the proposals to the Scottish Government and we have considered that analysis as part of the wider consultation exercise. A summary of that analysis will be provided.”\n“That would indicate that the charge for a concessionary permit is no longer cost effective in terms of income generation and the associated enforcement costs.”\n“A cost benefit impact is calculated by weighing the income gained through on-street permit charges and the expenditure on associated enforcement costs.”\n“Without the discount arrangements some car users would stop using the roads and parks which currently are not used by large volumes of motorists and many of which would quickly become congested.”\n“Without some parking provision a number of important visitor destinations in your area would become more difficult or even dangerous to visit or would be under threat of being cut off completely because people would not be able to bring vehicles to such sites, for example, the local primary school and the nearby sports and recreational facilities.”\n“The Scottish Government is therefore not going to be in a position to introduce a reduced concessionary charging scheme. It is expected that some of that income gained through the new permit scheme will enable certain services such as tourist information and the implementation of a safety scheme.”\n“The other approach considered was to maintain the current system, but to seek a reduction in the fees charged to some classes of user. The current charging scheme will continue to operate.”\n“In terms of options, my officials are advised that the Council could offer a reduced charge for short stay periods, possibly in the range of 20 minutes to one hour, on limited basis. There are limitations to what such a scheme would involve due to the associated costs to local authorities and the need to set appropriate standards for access.”\n“In light of the above, it is therefore not possible to reverse the charging scheme now without a significant costly and disruptive change.”\nIt had been suggested that some local car parks would become more unsafe, less accessible (including for the disabled community), and less attractive because of the proposed changes.\n“It is important to note that there may be occasions when there are specific situations where local communities might want to develop local measures to enhance their parking provision, in particular for the benefit of the local community. For example, an event such as a fun run or marathon might find that there is an excessive number of vehicles parked on local roads and therefore they wish to have a local scheme.”\n“I can advise the Council to contact me if they would like to discuss the matter in more detail.”\n“I therefore write once again to advise that the Scottish Government does not intend to introduce a scheme that would reverse the changes and that such a scheme would not be cost-effective in its current form.”\n“It is however important to recognise that the future provision of a concessionary parking scheme will not be affected; however the current charging arrangements will continue.”\n“The impact from the proposed changes, other than the changes to the concessionary permit arrangement, from July 2013 has been less severe than anticipated and has resulted in the Council having greater overall control over use of their car parks.”\n“In terms of the future of the concessionary permit scheme, I am advised that the Council will be able to make this decision within their local context and the Council will need to make a judgement about how it wishes to deliver a sustainable service into the long term.”\nLabels: Cllr.

{"text": "The third hurdle on the road to Wembley - after the draw and the qualifiers - was the play-off final. Liverpool wasted every opportunity in a scrappy second leg, but somehow won, and the chance to win a major trophy seemed real again.\nOn 21 May 1981 at Villa Park, Brendan lost, and it was a shock. The young players Liverpool had produced - and some they had acquired, like Ian Rush - never truly gelled, and no one took to the Premiership like they thought they would.\nLiverpool's fortunes did not improve - under Graziano - from 1981 to 1983, but they remained in top ten every year while the great and good were being dismantled for parts. Graziano's tenure lasted from October 1980 to October 1982, and with it came 12 games, 4 wins, 6 defeats and 2 draws, so, with an average league ranking of 10, Graziano's was a poor appointment.\nHe was replaced by Roy Evans. Like a lot of the new generation of managers, with little first team experience, most of the new appointments worked in the academies. Evans had been the head of the academy, so he knew as much as Graziano, and as much, but not more than Evans. He also had more experience of managing clubs than Graziano.\nIronically, Evans' first game in charge was the FA Cup Final. The defeat to Charlton (1, 2, 3) is still one of the most painful moments of Brendan's time at Liverpool - and one of the most memorable for Charlton. After the game, Roy said:\n\"I suppose we had no chance - this is the big time football. We had no idea what Liverpool really represents.\"\nEvans made some mistakes the second he took charge. His first was to put John Aldridge, who'd done well, behind the striker. The second was to field his weakest available starting 11 in an away semi-final against a reinvigorated Manchester United. Liverpool lost (0-1) but, despite the FA Cup defeat, he had saved Roy's job in the transfer window, and that gave him a chance to get it right.\nFor the 1983/84 season, Roy got it right. Evans signed Trevor Francis, Ray Kennedy, and Alan Hansen, bought Gary Gillespie from Manchester United, and signed new players - like Ian Rush - for what turned out to be his most successful season, including an FA Cup win after a 3-1 final win against Middlesbrough (2, 0, 1).\nBut, this was Brendan's era. He was now one of the senior players. He was one of the experienced Liverpool players - the older heads. And, in his third season, he was given the opportunity to take the captaincy that had already eluded him twice.\nLiverpool's league season started slowly under Evans, but Brendan would have been frustrated by his lack of opportunities. After being moved up to become a play-maker again, when it was obvious that he would never lead the line, in the second year under Evans, Brendan had already had a number of injuries, and with him - now a senior midfielder - the midfield looked a lot better.\nAs it turned out, the new season was one of the best in Liverpool's history. The young team gelled, and Liverpool won 18, drew 9 and lost 3 - not bad and they were only beaten by Arsenal (6-3) and Coventry (4-4) in the remaining 12 games, both in the league.\nThe league had changed with a massive 42 points required for a championship. Liverpool finished in a very creditable 2nd, only 3 points behind Arsenal.\nArsenal were also runners-up in the FA Cup. It was the first time since 1950 that two different teams had finished 2nd twice. They would later have a famous double (1970/71).\nThe Football League Cup was the third success of the era - and the first for Brendan. Liverpool beat Norwich City on penalties on 29 March 1984 and won 2-1.\nRoy made a great blunder with injuries in his last season.

{"text": "we report a fatal case of rickettsiosis in a woman living in a western state whose leisure activity was outdoor running on the Appalachian Trail in the southeastern U.S. during the summer and fall 2014. PCR for spotted fever group rickettsiae was positive, and the DNA sequence of the PCR product from the blood specimen of the patient, strain MG, matched sequence Sanger data from strain RP77 strain RG15034/AF287882, previously named Rickettsia bellii/Rb and Rb1B. The sequence results were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of protein-coding genes. Infection was confirmed in the patient's husband by PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF) with antiserum to rickettsial antigens detected in the blood specimen of the patient. The wife did not develop meningoencephalitic disease, but she developed fever, fatigue, and malaise for 5 months. She failed to respond to treatment with clarithromycin and atorvastatin plus doxycycline, and subsequently developed pneumonia and anemia. Despite aggressive diagnostic evaluation and therapy, she died from pneumonia and secondary infection, according to the death certificate. The case highlights the need to consider arthropod-borne infections in a previously nonendemic region of the U.S., and to report the unusual case to further understanding the epidemiology of rickettsioses.\nRickettsia bellii is a Gram-negative, spotted fever group rickettsia that infects mammals, especially rodents and squirrels 1. Humans typically become infected when bitten by infected ticks 2. The geographic distribution of this pathogen is unclear: it was recently described as infecting humans in 2 states in the Southern region of the United States, but its known host rosters include mice, voles, shrews, squirrels, and rabbits—all species known to have been present throughout the entire Eastern seaboard of the United States 3. However, the host range for the human host is unknown. A human case of rickettsial infection in 2007 was reported, which had caused meningovascular disease 4.\nSpotted fever group rickettsiae are characterized by the presence of ompA and ompB genes, which encode proteins with carbohydrate-binding activity that have a role in pathogenesis 5. Strains were named based on the host that the strain was originally detected in. Strains isolated prior to 2002 were named R. bellii/Rb1 to R.cooleyi/Rc3; strains isolated from 2002 to 2010 were named R. bellii/Rb2 to R. bellii/Rb45; and strains isolated from 2011 were R. bellii/Rb1B. Since 2014, the term Rickettsia bellii/Rb is used to refer to those strains that are in the R. bellii/Rb1-45 and Rickettsia bellii/Rb1B phylogroups or are named and characterized as either R. bellii/Rb or R. bellii/Rb1 (the group to which MG belongs) 6. Although the rickettsiae have long been known to infect humans, the majority of human rickettsial illness in the United States occurs in Arizona and California 1,8. The geographic distribution of rickettsiae in the U.S. is not fully understood, but there have been reports of R. canadensis infection in Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Washington 5,8. There have been no reports of infection in humans in the Southern region of the United States.\nWe describe a case of fatal rickettsiosis of the Western subspecies Rickettsia bellii (genotype RB1) in a woman who lived in Alabama, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia from 2012 to 2016, and worked as an outdoor event planning sales associate who lived near the Appalachian Trail.

{"text": "protein clearance is critical for the maintenance of the integrity and function of the kidney. In the United States and Western European countries, protein‐rich foods constitute <15% of the diet, whereas in developing countries such as China, protein constitutes 40% of daily calories. In China, dietary protein comes primarily from meat, and meat consumption is approximately 400–500 g/d (>100 g/d above current guidelines). The consumption of high levels of protein is associated with an increased risk of CKD.\nThe most frequent complicating factors of CKD in the United States are diabetes and hypertension. Together, these comorbidities represent a high risk for progression to end‐stage renal disease in patients with CKD. The risk of death related to diabetes or hypertension is approximately 4‐fold greater in patients with CKD than in the general population.\nThe prognostic significance of proteinuria has been extensively studied. The magnitude and severity of proteinuria are important predictors of progression to end‐stage renal disease. The severity of proteinuria is also an important predictor of survival in patients with CKD. The relative importance of nonalbuminuric proteinuria is being studied. Nonalbuminuric proteinuria is a more accurate predictor of survival than albuminuria, and reduction in albuminuria decreases the risk of survival.\nRationale for Implementing a Renal Protection Strategy\nImmediate management of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is a complicating factor for CKD, and can have a profound impact on the prognosis if left untreated. In some situations, the immediate goal of treatment should be to reduce the serum creatinine concentration.\nManagement of diabetes and hypertension. These disorders are major complicating factors of CKD. Together, they contribute to the progression of CKD, represent a significant risk of mortality, and significantly affect quality of life. Immediate goals of treatment include lowering serum creatinine and blood pressure, and reducing glucose and lipids as appropriate.\nMinimization of exposure to nephrotoxic agents. The risks of exposure to nephrotoxic drugs are well recognized in the health care community. In 2010 (revised in 2013), the International Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation released consensus guidelines about nephrotoxic therapies, and these guidelines are summarized in Table 5‐3.\nTable 5‐3: Key Elements of the 2010 (revised in 2013) Consensus Guidelines on Nephrotoxin Management\nReduce risk whenever possible when considering nephrotoxic medications.\nConsider avoidance in high‐risk situations, such as acute CKD, chronic CKD with electrolyte abnormalities, a history of recurrent AKI, and the elderly.\nConsider reduction for patients with an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or with recurrent AKI when the drug is likely to prolong a critical stay in the hospital.\nConsider reduction for nephroprotective drugs such as dopamine, a1 A receptor blockers, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers.\nAssessment of albuminuria. Patients with proteinuria, especially nonalbuminuric proteinuria (>300 mg/24 h), are at increased risk for progression of CKD and future end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) and should be monitored and treated appropriately. The level of proteinuria may also be indicative of a high mortality risk in patients with CKD.\nAssess CKD stage and progression. CKD stages should be assigned based on eGFR according to either the MDRD or CKD Epidemiology Collaboration study equations. Progression should be monitored at least biennially. Acceleration markers, such as UAE or albuminuria, may also be of value.\nIdentify individuals at high risk for ESRD. ESRD prognosis depends on age and eGFR. The risk of mortality increases with age and progressively increases with a lower eGFR.\nIdentify individuals for renal transplant evaluation. The National Kid", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "\"Hockey?\" suggested a teenager uncertainly. \"Basketball?\" ventured  another. Most kids seemed to think that it's about something involving sticks. The reality is that, for better or worse, music is one of the most important ways the world can learn about America. How do we get more music to more people? By helping the artists.\nBut first, we have to understand the problem. Record companies have failed. They have tried for decades to create a \"hit\", but they still haven't figured out how to do it. Hits still come from small labels. The best music is still not made known to the public.\nThere are now two kinds of artists. The ones who believe that if they hustle hard enough they can do well by themselves, and the ones who just don't know how. The ones who have succeeded are either lucky or incredibly persistent. The ones who have failed are the ones who have simply never had a \"hit\".\nIt is time to take a new approach. It is time for record companies to stop trying to make hits and start supporting artists. It is time for radio stations to stop worrying about which new songs will sell, and to start doing what is best for their listeners. It is time for the marketing geniuses at record companies to stop thinking in terms of \"the masses\" and start helping the best artists to the largest audiences possible. It is time for all of this for it to stop focusing on short term results. This is not some selfless charity for \"poor old artists\". No charity. This is economic logic. It is about making the artists the center of the creative process. It is about recognizing where success will and won't come from, and about making the appropriate decisions in light of that. This can only happen if the music industry itself stops behaving as though it is a giant charity, or as though the artists (their customers) are a bunch of children not worthy of competent management. There is no magic. There are no shortcuts. The artists simply need some help. The record business wants to know; why is that the case?\nI don't know what that answer is. I know who I am. I don't know where you are. You probably know who you are a bit better than I do. Maybe we could learn from each other. There are probably tens of thousands of artists out there willing to make beautiful songs, to tour the country, to play their music for anyone who wants to come and listen, but no one can reach you. We can't play it in your stores and your bars. The marketplace refuses to exist outside the boundaries of giant conglomerates or the corporate culture of the record industry. We can't get people to see you or hear you or buy our records through the mainstream press. But it would be worth it for you. And it would be worth it for us.\nSo maybe we could start right there. There should be no corporate control over music and information, other than the limits created by copyright law. If someone wants to sell you a song he or she made, you should have the freedom to buy it (a la carte). The music industry has spent a lot of time and effort making sure that you don't have that choice-why does everyone still feel in charge? So I think the first step is to make it clear to the record companies: if they wish to sell you goods, they must sell it to you as \"artist-defined product\" (not label-defined). To be part of the marketplace, the artists must always decide what goes into it, and they must get paid for you to participate. We must be allowed to have a say in what we sell.\nWhat is the effect of this change? Well, artists would not have to worry about selling millions of records to make a living and get a good recording budget, and they would finally have the freedom to take risks on projects they really believe in. Artists would feel like they could do their best work.\nBeyond these obvious benefits, there are many lesser benefits as well. Artists would once again have a chance for sustained success. Labels would no longer have to choose between making small advances on risky ventures, or signing artists that don't actually have a chance to do anything. There would be hundreds of smaller (as well as bigger) markets available to artists. This change would allow local bands (the ones with all those CD-Rs in their pockets) to find some places to play, and thus a chance to grow an audience. Record stores would begin to sell things people wanted to buy, and would not have to rely just on the latest fad, for goodness sake. There would be a return to localized support for music.

{"text": "a new version of the phase method of determining the location of a source of emission in space, assuming the emission of spherically symmetric radiation or radiation of some other regular, symmetric form, having for each position only a single spherical wave of the same form. The phases (that is, relative angular differences in the directions of the electric radiation field vector) are computed, and the value assigned to each phase is derived from the amplitude of the radiation and from the value of a particular radial distance at the position of the detector from which the radiation is observed; the radiation field of the source is thus obtained by multiplication of its amplitude by absolute values of the phases, from which the source location is obtained by inversion of the phases.\nThe procedure was first used (1940) by the British physicist H. Tomlinson to describe the behavior of radation propagating in a medium without dispersion (homogeneous spherical layer) and by the British mathematician W. L. Bragg (1943) in generalizations to more complex conditions (1940–50).\n[′sərk·ə·səl, ′ser·k·əs·əl pō‚li′tsik΄]\n<a href=\"https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Coupled+Spherical+Waves\">spherical wave theory</a>\nconcentric spherical zone of convergence\nCoolidge effect\nCoolidge, Herbert Clark\nCoolidge, John Calvin\nCoolidge-Murphy effect\nCoolies System\nCooke, Arthur\nCooke, Howard A.\nCoulomb acceleration\nCouple Dual\nCouple Electric Power Simulator\nCouple Integral\ncouple joint\nCouple Sensor\nCouple-Gain System\nCoupled Boundary Elements\nCoupled Cavity\ncoupled cross-winding impedance\nCoupled Deformations and Vibrations\nCoupled Finite Element Analysis\ncoupled grating\ncoupled-gauss\nCoupled-Oscillator Model\ncoupled-tube theory\nCoupled-Wave Model\ncoupled-wavonist model\ncoupled-wave-function method\nCoupled-Wave Theory of Optical Activity\nCoupled-Waves Theory of Optical Activity\ncoupled-wave-vibration model", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "[17], [18]. In our recent work, we showed that one of the most basic principles guiding the evolution of DNA viruses is that a virus that can infect a cell, using its surface proteins, that does not have a surface protein it can use, will eventually become extinct [23]. We showed that if a virus infected a cell that did not have a surface protein it could bind to and infect, by not doing so for at least 500 times the timespan in evolution that a viral protein could bind for, that particular virus would become extinct [23]. For example, if a virus evolved to bind with a protein that could enter the cell that had the receptor for its virus and if another virus evolved and had receptors for some protein that could not enter the cell; i.e. the virus could only enter a cell that had a protein or receptor of the virus, then that virus evolving a protein it could not bind to would die out [23]. The evolution of a specific receptor and the virus proteins to use that receptor is an important mechanism during the spread of infections and viral diseases.\nSince one of our observations was that virus replication was important in the control of viral populations and the spread of infections [23], we investigated what effect changing the surface proteins (gene sequences) of viruses could have on the viral population. In our recent work, we modeled the evolution of some of these viruses and showed that the most likely result of evolution producing a change in some gene or gene sequence is that the viral pathogen would die out or spread but at an slower rate because the new mutant replicated more slowly than wild viruses [23]. But, we also showed that the virus population could evolve to produce viruses that could infect a new host cell of higher fitness. If that host cell had several proteins on its surface that could not be used to target its viral protein the new viral population would spread exponentially and outcompete old infectious disease populations [23]. We also found that the virus population that became extinct would spread as fast as their wild viral counterpart that kept the same gene sequences and that when evolving viral populations spread faster, wild population populations spread slower. The difference in spread can be measured in hours or days or even weeks with a spread rate of 2, 5, 10,000, 20,000, 40,000 times that of its wild counterpart [23]. These results suggest that evolution in the populations of viruses can have a larger fitness (spread) impact than we previously thought, particularly with the evolution of the cell surface proteins that target viral gene products to the cell surface.\nThis study shows that mutations in gene sequences of a viral pathogen and the change in viral protein surface properties have profound effects on the virus itself as well as the evolution of that virus and its ability to infect other cells. Changes in protein surface properties and genetic mutations had profound effects on the rate of evolution of a virus by up to 10,000 fold. This effect increases when the viruses do not have receptors and receptors are added or changed over multiple generations. We then show how the evolution of receptors can change the shape of the curve of the spread of the virus and how the rates of spread of a virus population change based upon the evolution of its surface proteins.\nThe above findings show we have only just begun to understand the complex set of molecular interactions at the beginning of the emergence of an infectious disease and that the evolution of viruses is often more complex than previously thought. Understanding how mutations in surface genes and virus protein binding mechanisms effect virus evolution can be used to manipulate the emergence of infectious diseases by either reducing the spread of a virus or its pathogen as well as helping us to understand why infectious diseases can emerge and kill.\nBoth the authors of this article wish to declare that there is no competing interest that could be construed as influencing the results described in this paper.\n[1] Meng, H. and Wang, Y.L.

{"text": "aim. to determine the diabetic foot ulcer incidence and risk factors associated with diabetic foot ulcer in a 2 -year period. METHODS : This was a prospective study on the diabetic foot ulcer incidence among patients attending the endocrine clinic. Information was obtained with an objective diabetic foot care assessment on a standard protocol. Data on diabetic foot ulcers were collected and analyzed over a 24-month period, October 2011- October 2013. RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen patients were enrolled, 57 (50.01%) women and 56 (49.97%) men, of which 96 (82.98%) were aged <49 years. Mean duration of diabetes was 11 and mean age of onset was 24 years. The median duration of diabetes was 11 years. Previous foot ulcer was present in 30.3% of participants but were not associated with a higher rate of ulceration. The prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer was 16.52 per 100 patients, perianal ulcers being the most frequent site of ulceration. The most common aetiology of diabetic foot ulcer was neuropathy (42.9%), with the most common ulcer type being a plantar ulcer in 133 (88.3%) of the 149 diabetic foot ulcers analysed. The most common causative factors were anatomical abnormality, peripheral neuropathy, plantar ulcer and peripheral vascular disease. Age <49 years old and duration of diabetes 22-40 years were associated with a higher risk of diabetic foot ulcer. CONCLUSION : Diabetic foot ulcers are associated with socioeconomic status and presence of diabetic nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy and vascular disease. However, previous foot ulcer was not associated with higher incidence of ulcers. AIDS CARE. 2015;27. Epub 2015/06/11. doi: 1017.1080/09540121.2015.1032947, 16 (4) pp. 589-594. ISSN 09540121.

Combs are placed in a square array.\nCarefully remove sand from the dorsal surface of the juvenile lobate from a mating pair with tweezers. Avoid damaging the thin filamentous antennae.\nCarefully examine the trunk and antennae of a laboratory lobate for injuries before moving it. Examine the trunk with a 20X hand lens for injuries or wounds to the surface of the cuticle, as well as small, de-colored spots on the body and any obvious wounds or injuries to the appendages. Examine the trunk for signs of encrustation with algal filaments or detached algal filaments, or any other unusual growth. Examine the antennae when the individual is an adult for obvious damage or injury at a magnification of at least 50X. Note abrasions, scrapes, lacerations, missing appendages (e.g., antennae or claws) or injuries. The antennae are thin and filamentous, with numerous tiny branches on their ends; these antennae might be damaged, and branches, or several ends, might be detached. Damage to or absence of the antennae does not usually reduce the reproductive capacity of this species. The male antennae are slightly darker and somewhat thicker than those of the female. Both antennae have five branches on the distal ends. The antennae of a young adult male are not much thinner than a juvenile. The branching ends of the antennae are usually darker and somewhat thicker than the proximal, unbranched sections of the antennae. Note the presence of an operculum to cover the opening of the rectal atrium. The adult male will be more slender than the female, with longer (60–134 per side) and more fragile claws located farther back on the trunk (Figs. 168, 169). Adult females may have slightly larger claws, but this information is difficult to obtain. Cut the muscles back from the trunk to identify the rectal atrium and note its size. A single pair of male appendages (claspers), one on each side, is also located a little behind the operculum. The appendages are fragile, covered with small branching hairs and a dark band of dark green to black cells on the bases. Both the posterior claws and the appendages at the anterior end of the trunk may be missing in adults from heavily fished ponds. The claws are located behind the operculum, with the trunk between the claws and the operculum, and the claws are located beneath the operculum. The anterior claws of males are smaller and longer than the posterior claws. The anterior claws are located between the anterior ends of the antennae and are usually found detached from the trunk or broken off from the trunk. The posterior claws usually extend from the cuticle slightly past the anterior claws.\nLobate trout, like some other species, have a tendency to move about slowly during the day. At night, they will often dive into the bottom. Lobate trout frequently leave their hiding places to feed in the twilight. During the day, lobate trout usually prefer to remain close to sheltered areas because the ambient temperatures reach highs of 24°C to 30°C. They rest with their trunks slightly elevated off the bottom and their antennae just protruding. They are easily frightened, and will often rapidly dive deeper and hide in a crevice if disturbed. Lobate trout feed in openings of the substrate on a wide variety of invertebrates, including crustaceans, including isopods (e.g., Ischyrocera nebulosus). Lobate trout reach maturity within the first year and do not spawn prolifically, however, they can spawn in any month. This species is a popular game fish. Lobate trout are sometimes intentionally introduced into lakes and ponds.\nKuehne, John R. 1999a. Lobate Trout, Galaxias rostratus Godeaux. Page 265, Figure 6 in: The Fishes of Wisconsin.

The HST program that is investigating the two most recent supernova discoveries (PS1-10afx and PS1-10bwh) also turned up a candidate in another new image. This candidate is also very nearby to us, but on the eastern side of the galaxy, near a faint edge.\nThe HST program is also investigating the bright supernova discovered by H. Foley last December (discovery number SN2006et), a result of the new program that targets the best of the previous supernova discoveries that was started last year. The program is taking several images, spread over several epochs, a week to six weeks apart, in order to study the evolution and morphology of this particular supernova. The team expects to know more about this one in an update next month.\nThe team is now pursuing three more new supernova discoveries found in a new HST program. The images will be reduced and analyzed immediately when the data from this program arrive.\nThe supernovae that had been discovered last season will be investigated in the coming months. A conference call on this topic will be announced, and the team will provide a brief update on that portion of the program.\nIn October a team will attempt to recover the targeting image and confirm the identity of PS1-14ctb, a rare, nearby Type Ia supernova visible in a ground-based image acquired last fall, by re-imaging it with HST.\nPS1-10afx is a candidate, and PS1-10dgs may have turned into a very bright flare. This flare, if it is there, may have also resulted in the discovery of a new supernova. The team may present information about this flare next week.\nIn April 2007 the supernova program celebrated its tenth anniversary by holding a program review meeting. For those who might be interested, a short summary from that meeting might be appropriate here. Overall, the team has discovered 350 supernovae with the HST. The Hubble space telescope was not designed to study supernova, nor was it ever intended to make a program of it. Its discoveries far exceeded the expectations of the team, and it has continued for more than a decade because it remains an important goal.\nThe program can only take advantage of its opportunity to observe supernovae by working very quickly. This was very challenging with the program's limited time on HST. The team had to be very selective about which targets were pursued first when making the scheduling decisions. This meant that many supernova did not get observed with HST until several years after their initial discovery, and many more were never observed at all.\nThe program was also very successful at obtaining follow up observations with large ground based telescopes. Over 150 supernovae have received this additional observation. Of the supernovae observed with HST, the team discovered 37 spectra (images with supernovae seen in them), with two additional supernova found in follow up with HST, 30 more were subsequently identified in follow up observations. The most difficult task is the recovery of the SN, and only 26 have subsequently been found in ground based images. The reason supernovae, with their rapid decline, are so difficult to find in ground based images is the supernova are not always at their peak brightness when the image is made, and often some of the background emission (from the host galaxy, diffuse light from nearby galaxies, or other sources) obscures the brightness of the supernova. For the supernovae not recovered in ground based images the spectra did not show clearly enough signifacant difference in the spectral features to identify the supernovae, which might not be the same as what one would expect from type Ia SNe.\nOne of the most important advantages of the program was the very detailed multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of the SN host galaxies.\nMany of the hosts in this catalog remain in galaxy groups with large amounts of dust. This prevents a detailed morphological study of the host galaxies by ground based telescopes.\nA survey of all known supernovae with the HST was undertaken by the IAU Supernova Coordinating Committee. This resulted in a list of 377 supernovae with the HST. Some of them were from other programs, but 21", "label": "llama"}

These proteins kill the target cell by toxicity as they can form complexes with aminophospholipids in the target membrane and cause the formation of pores that lead to membrane damage and cell death.\nCyclotides are not antibodies, nor do they have any obvious cell-killing activity, however they have the potential to do both of these functions.\nClinical research (1): The research by the National Academy of Engineering has allowed cyclotides to be discovered as very potent medicines that can help cure various diseases. It has brought them to the forefronts of biomedicine, and has allowed them to be applied to medicine.\nClinical research (2): More research can be performed on these proteins to allow them to be further investigated with potential drug and medicinal uses.\nFishing.

An extraction technique that allows for the extraction of various marine and freshwater materials. The protein-rich biomaterials can be used in cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical applications.\nDiseases. Cyclotides that bind to specific targets can be used against disease because once they bind to something, they essentially have a higher affinity to bind to that target. This is how they are toxic though.\nVaccines. Once they create specific vaccines that bind to known toxins and contaminants, it would allow for the detection of these things, and also could help create medicine against them. This would also create a much more effective method of detoxification.\n\"A mini protein is a peptide-based material with a fold and structure unique to its species. These proteins are typically present at less than 5ppm (parts per million by dry weight) in their organism. 23% of proteins were found to be mini proteins, however a mere 0.3% were found to be uniquely identifiable, and 0.001% were found to exhibit novel folds. There are four main classes of proteins: cytokins, coagulins, cell-wall anchoring proteins, and proteases. One unique example discovered during the research was the discovery of a Mt. Fuji protein that is an anticodon. Amino acids on the ribosome have an anticodon, which helps aid in the tRNA decoding process by giving a unique anticodon which bonds to it.\"\n\" A peptide is a small protein used in drug research. Peptides are an easily synthesized protein with many applications for medical research. Due to their small size, they are able to fit into binding pockets on protein receptors on the cell surface. These receptors are targets for many proteins involved in processes ranging from metabolism to inflammation. Proteins may be a cure for many diseases, but in drug research, peptides are a crucial step in getting there. Peptides have many advantages over traditional forms of proteins since they are easier to synthesize, are stable for many years, and are very small.\"\nThis page was last modified on 9 March 2014, at", "label": "llama"}

I wasn't expecting that.\nThe murders are gruesome and the killers mutilate the animal corpses as well, which I guess shows that they don't get the fact that hey, mutilating animals' bodies for fun is kind of pointless.\nThe film's not very good otherwise, with some pretty amateur acting when they aren't making animal heads disappear, and I had difficulty keeping up with how many people are in on the whole thing, as they don't particularly have distinct personalities.\nI'm sure I wouldn't have been too concerned if it had been just someone killing cows, but once they murder a woman and start to cut her guts out, I was a little bit more interested to the plot.\nThis is the second low budget movie directed by one Charles S.

{"text": "Of all the movies of the seventies, none captured to a greater degree the spirit of the age than the Easy Rider. The film, which came out in July 1969, had two major ingredients: a great central love story and a counterculture soundtrack.\nThe love story was a tender one between the film's narrator, an affluent aspiring journalist, and a young hippie. The music, the score that is (as the credits state), was an evocative mix of rock, folk and blues. It included work from The Band, Steppenwolf, The Byrds, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Moby Grape, The Beach Boys, Janis Joplin and Creedence Clearwater Revival. It was, to be sure, a perfect piece of zeitgeist marketing.\nThis week, some 40 years later, one of the lead actors, Jack Nicholson, was back in Hollywood to promote a movie in which he plays someone very different from the character that has come to define him.\nDouglas Smith, one of the film's producers, saw Nicholson recently at his studio on Pacific Avenue. \"He came over to visit,\" Smith said. \"It's just him and me. He brought it. He came over and just started going at it. It was just all that passion you associate with Nicholson, the same enthusiasm that he had when he was in his thirties.\"\nThe film, is, on the surface, very, very different from the movie that brought Nicholson a nomination for Best Actor, which he won. And yet, at the same time, you can't understate just how similar both movies are. While they are very much products of their time, at their essence, they are, really, very much the same story.\nTo that point, the characters that the Hollywood powerhouse depicts tend toward extreme behaviour. In 'Wolfman,' Jack Nicholson is a lonely, elderly man, living by himself on the Oregon coast. At a diner that is the heart of the community, people who sit there know him. They know to expect the usual. He shows up for dinner every day, and gets his eggs, hash browns. He's a quiet man.\n\"The rest of his life he lives like it's 1919,\" Smith said. \"In the 21st century, he is living life much as it was in the early 1900s.\"\nOne night he catches sight of a woman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, in a diner. She gives him the once over, then looks away. When he goes over to speak to her, he gets a few inches from her and she tells him to back up.\n\"Back up and get out of my face,\" she says. \"I never have to see you again.\"\nHe does, and later that night, he returns. He sneaks into his grandson's house, and breaks in. He breaks the bedroom window so he can sneak into the room. Eventually, like a kid, his nerve gets the better of him and he wakes up the grandson, who grabs his bat and chases his grandpa away.\nBut Jack, like any man in his late stage of life, wants to take what he wants, and he's a man bent on revenge. The next day, he comes to the diner and, again, starts staring at Mary Elizabeth. She, again, gives him the once over. When he goes over to talk to her, she throws him out of the cafe. He goes and does some damage, which is just inexplicable, he is on the other end of that behaviour. Later that day, he comes to the diner again. He orders the fries, but this time, he just walks up to her, and kisses her on the mouth.\nAt that moment, it was the only thing he had to offer.\n\"He came to find something to give, this man who was searching for meaning, to find meaning,\" Smith said.\nThis is not unlike Dennis Hopper, in 'Easy Rider,' looking for meaning. Hopper's character travels from Los Angeles to New Orleans on an endlessly churning machine, a motorcycle with one last tank of gas and enough booze to see that tank to its very bitter end. He gets in the way of a southern sheriff who wants to confiscate the bike and cash from \"dealers,\" as motorcyclists were called", "label": "llama"}

(Hey, even Dame Bette Midler admired that stomach-quelling fizzy brown liquid. What can't she do?)\nBut fame doesn't come from simply starting a business. It takes a talent, a unique flair, something that'll draw people in, make them come back.\nThat's just how it was with the infamous Mr. Ernie, who came up with an idea for a fast-food sandwich 50 years too late.\nFoss El came out with the Elmwood Grinder (the El-Mister) in 1959. It was an unremarkable sandwich consisting of mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes and two or three slices of baloney or bologna (the word \"sandwich\" comes from sandwiches, after all).\nBetter than 50/50\nBut Elmwood Grinders also offered a special drink. You'd get a cup of juice, milk or coffee. Or you could buy an extra ounce for one-fourth the price of a cup of juice or milk.\nWas it better than half? That's what Foss El marketed.\n\"It's better than a 50/50, it's 75/25.\"\nAt $0.20, an extra ouncer of juice cost only 4.06%. But in order to make the 4.06% of one ouncer pay off, you'd have to drink enough of the Juice Ouncer that -- after the first cup of juice or milk -- not only would more juice or milk have to be added, but you'd have to buy a second cup as well.\nAnd, not being a drinker, most El-Mister customers would know that.\nIt didn't help that Foss El's competitors were already serving \"juice boxes\" (and also offering extra ouncers for 4.06%).\nAnother problem Foss El had was that even in the late 1950s, \"juice,\" with a \"U,\" was associated with children, whereas \"juice,\" with an \"I,\" was a euphemism for the opposite of juice.\nOne of the problems that Foss El had was that as you drank a second ouncer, the extra-sweet, extra-sour flavor got lost to drinkers who had been acclimated to the plain old stuff.\nAnd yet another problem was that milk was a lot more liquid than juice, so El-Mister customers had to drink more juice in order to get their quota for the day.\nOn top of that, Foss El sold his milk in glass bottles. You'd get your ouncer of juice in plastic cups, then you'd head over to the milk fridge and pick out a fresh, clean bottled milk. It was easy to see that you'd be drinking a more expensive juice versus milk deal.\nStill, I'll bet a fair number of folks did buy the drink.\nIt had to be a bummer for Mr. Ernie to watch his business tank, but at least he found out that it is indeed possible to get better than 50/50.\nPosturing and positioning: The art of looking like everyone and no one\nHere's one of those posts that takes a position, then tries to back away from it so they can say they took everyone into consideration and were very neutral:\nBank of England Governor Mervyn King, left, is seen after speaking at the Trades Union Congress (TUC) annual conference in Bournemouth, southern England, Tuesday.

{"text": "Eventually, the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and beliefs, and creating a new identity. A new people evolved, which was called the Anglo-Saxon, or the Anglo-Norman, but this didn’t stop the arrival, after a while, of more and more Normans, who occupied the highest positions, and soon, even the royal crown. In the 13th century, a massive invasion of Anglo-Normans began, which was a strong, well-organised group of invaders who set foot on our territory. In a few decades, they managed to take over the government and administration of the English territories. In fact, by now, the French had already spoken English, so it’s not too hard to imagine how hard they pressed on the French people. They didn’t only conquer the English territory, but also conquered Scotland.\nThe influence of all of these different peoples in the English identity has been so strong that, even today, the Anglo-Saxon population is no longer the same as the English population, as most of the migrations that are coming in today, belong to the Anglo-Saxon population, but their origins are mixed all the time now.\nThe history of England is really interesting and complex, and it’s full of characters, which we already know from the popular culture: Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, William Shakespeare, Oliver Cromwell, Winston-Churchill, to name a few. The English are also famous for being one of the most multicultural people in the world, since they have welcomed immigrants from all corners of the world, like the Italians, Greeks, Jews, Poles, Asians, Chinese, Africans, and all the other nationalities in the world.\nAs I was saying at the beginning of the article, the English can be quite proud, and they are, of course, proud of the rich history they carry with them.

The proposed pathway includes several steps that are unexplored in the literature. One of these steps is the dehydration activation of C3,5-unsaturated keto esters, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and its esters, on HPO-Pi catalysts. The rate constant for this reaction, which is shown to be rate-limiting for all the reactions in this pathway and thus for the whole catalytic cycle, is highly sensitive to pH (100 to 500 times as sensitive as at the standard conditions); this indicates that the mechanism of the process is a pH effect, and also suggests that proton transfer along the entire reaction pathway is slow. The kinetics of activation of penta-1,5-dienol by hydrogen bond activation on HPO-Pi was also investigated. The keto-enol intramolecular isomerization is much faster (7 orders of magnitude) than that of its corresponding dinitrile, and the mechanism is ascribed to enzyme-like activation of its hydroxyl group through proton transfer. These results represent the first characterization of the hydrolysis of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid by HPO-Pi catalysts, its activation on catalysts bearing an extra hydroxyl group, and its isomerization through cocatalysis of pH.\nMots-clés: ab-initio calculation, aldol, catalysis, catalytic cycle, chiral keto acids, enolate, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, hetero-hydrogen bonds, hydrogen bond activation, hydrogen bonding, hydroxyl group, isomerization, molar-oscillator strength, molecular orbital energy, oxygen atom, pathway, phosphate, phosphate cation, proton, proton transfer, protonation, reaction mechanism, reaction rate\nEffect of n-acceptor site on the selectivity of ZSM-5 for propene oxidation†\nJing Zhang,ab Michael L.

{"text": "About 900 people packed into Toronto's Opera House on Tuesday to watch the Toronto Argonauts, who've never won the Grey Cup in their 12-year existence, play for the title they've twice failed to capture in the four years since they last won it. The crowd came in waves at the front door of the venerable theatre, which is about the opposite of BMO Field when it comes to ease of getting in to see the home games.\nEven before kick-off, a 15-minute pre-game video set the stage for the night's main attraction. This was followed by speeches that were largely free from the cynicism that has infiltrated professional sports in recent years and the game itself, which featured three lead changes and a late surge by Saskatchewan in a tight defensive struggle. But that all came after a stirring performance by singer-songwriter Feist of \"The Park, the River\" and her first big hit \"Mushaboom.\"\nAnother favourite, K'Nann and \"Pow Pow\" kept the crowd pumped from the seats on the lower bowl, and one of the more memorable highlights of the night was a performance by the Jordin Arnold Jazz Quartet, a group of five talented young musicians on the University of Toronto jazz programs. They performed \"This Is What We Came For\" and \"Chasing the Wind\" and drew rave reviews from the sold out crowd.\nThen the game came. With less than two minutes left and the Riders on defence, Saskatchewan's 15th-ranked Adam Petrangelo was called for interference on a punt return that ultimately became the game-winning point for the Argos. It was the first interference call of the night and was a game-changer, much like Petrangelo's three interference penalties on previous possessions.\nArgos quarterback Ricky Ray was stellar, going 22-for-36 with 303 passing yards and three touchdowns through the air. Saskatchewan back-up Darian Durant completed 21-of-39 for 371 yards and three touchdowns as the Riders defence was stifling, holding the Argos to 188 yards of offence.\nThe Grey Cup had been in Toronto twice in the past, with the Argos and the BCCA respectively, the first time in 1922 and the second time in 1945. A 2007 CFL decision added the city to the Grey Cup rotation. So this year, the 2013 Grey Cup was in Toronto.\nAnd while people were disappointed on many levels that the game didn't live up to the hype, the performance by the players, management and volunteers should be nothing but praised. The Argos were in the driver's seat in the final seven minutes of play but blew a big lead in the dying seconds. And while no one would blame the fans for giving way to sadness after the game, by the time the players had left the floor, they had the stage to themselves and the fans were singing along to \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" and \"Toronto Bad Boy.\"\nAfter the game, the Argos' celebration continued at Queen's Park, where a giant 2013 Grey Cup Championship parade would take the team back to their locker room. This all followed the Argos 2012 victory parade a year ago. But this time, they were making a second straight appearance in the final.\nThe next Grey Cup championship game will be in Toronto on November 24, 2013.", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "we study unlimited infinite churn in peer - to - peer networks with different topologies. the peer -to - peer network is considered as a dynamic system. we provide a mathematical approach to study the infinite churn of peers. this study focuses on how the maximum numbers of peers are at the same time in the network and how the number of peers in a peer will be reduced to a minimum number.\nAbstract. The purpose of network capacity planning is to predict future demand on a telecommunications network to meet growth demands in the future and to allocate needed financial resources in the present. The present study introduces a Network Capacity Planning (NCP) model to predict growth in cellular network demand (e.g. radio cell, wireless service, subscriber, or line) using a methodology that integrates geo-demographic modeling, mobile phone projections, and telecommunications network planning. The NCP model uses spatial (point level) and agent-based (line level) components to account for spatial and temporal dynamics of mobile phone market and telecommunications networks. The NCP model is applied for cellular demand forecasting in Los Angeles for the period of 1990–2006. The model predicts number of lines per cell by year and per cellular market area (CMA) by year. The prediction accuracy of the network capacity model is confirmed with independent forecasts by a mobile phone market share forecast. By applying the NCP model, a cellular network is considered “too small” if there is no room for cellular growth in the time span of the study (2004−2006). In the study area, the network capacity model indicates the need for 157 cellular radio sites to meet subscriber demands for the period of 2004−2006. This indicates that the network growth rate in the study area is substantial and that by current trends, it is likely that the cellular network will expand to fill the total geographical area of the region. The spatial heterogeneity of the cellular market is indicated by market share maps and point maps of cellular market shares. For example, CMAs (such as CMA 402) with a small base of telephone lines in 1998 or 2002 (i.e. fewer than 100 lines) showed large growth rates in demand (i.e. in subscriber numbers) in 2004 and 2005. On the other hand, CMAs (such as CMA 400 and 401) with large base telephone lines in 1998 or 2002 had negative growth rates (i.e. decreasing subscriber numbers) in 2004 and 2005. The implications are discussed for telecommunications network design and capacity planning for L.A. County.\nABSTRACT: The purpose of network capacity planning is to predict future demand on a telecommunications network to meet growth demands in the future and to allocate needed financial resources in the present. The present study introduces a Network Capacity Planning (NCP) model to predict growth in cellular network demand (e.g. radio cell, wireless service, subscriber, or line) using a methodology that integrates geo- demographic modeling, mobile phone projections, and telecommunications network planning. The NCP model uses spatial (point level) and agent- based (line level) components to account for spatial and temporal dynamics of mobile phone market and telecommunications networks. The NCP model is applied for cellular demand forecasting in Los Angeles for the period of 1990-2006. The model predicts number of lines per cell by year and per cellular market area (CMA) by year. The prediction accuracy of the network capacity model is confirmed with independent forecasts by a mobile phone market share forecast. By applying the NCP model, a cellular network is considered \"too small\" if there is no room for cellular growth in the time span of the study (2004-2006). In the study area, the network capacity model indicates the need for 157 cellular radio sites to meet subscriber demands for the period of 2004-2006. This indicates that the network growth rate in the study area is substantial and that by current trends, it is likely that the cellular network will expand to fill the total geographical area of the region.

With a 150-m-diameter ring, a 25-m collider tunnel, and a center-ofmass energy of up to 1-TeV ̇ 1, a photon collider could study the Higgs to a mass of 1-TeV ̇ 2 and the baryon to an even higher mass of 10-TeV ̇ 3 (Figure 1). The lepton mass has already been explored to much higher energies in electron–positron colliders. The high luminosity of such a collider can also provide unique opportunities to study the structure of ordinary matter with small-angle Bhabha scattering experiments. One could also study the internal structure of baryons and search for exotic bound states of light quarks and search for evidence of baryons with unusual flavors or spin. For all of these reasons,\na photon collider would be the world’s most powerful particle collider and would be a crucial piece in the global particle-physics program over the next few decades.\nA photon collider is a new type of particle collider capable of producing, storing, and colliding photons at the highest possible energies. It will, for the first time in history, provide a probe into the structure of ordinary matter and the underlying theory of a quantum field. A photon collider is unique but can and probably ought to be connected to a new generation of electron–positron colliders, such as CEPC, to achieve its full potential. This has a large influence on the parameters and construction of the photon collider. An integrated photon collider–electron–positron collider detector might use one of today’s existing electron– positron detectors while the photon collider would be an entirely new detector.", "label": "llama"}

Secondary aim: to evaluate if proliferation or apoptosis of retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE) is correlated with peripapillary RNFL thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). METHOD: a clinical retrospective study with 80 eyes-40 patients with DME and 40 age-matched healthy controls. Peripapillary RNFL thickness (peripapillary RNFL-thinning) was measured by GDxV. Tissue sections were stain via Hematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) to evaluate RPE proliferation (RPE proliferation), and via Trypan Blue (TB) to evaluate RPE apoptosis (RPE apoptosis). RESULTS: Patients with DME were 7.08 ± 2.32 years older than the control group (p=0.0014). Macular thickness was significantly higher (198 ± 55.8 µm) in the group of patients with DME in comparison with control group (164.9 ± 53.2 µm) [p= 0.0087]. Peripapillary RNFL thickening was significantly less (26.1 ± 4.04 µμ) in patients with DME in comparison to control group (37.53±5.8 µm) [p=0.035]. H & E staining revealed the RPE proliferation in control group was 2.84 ± 1.38 %. RPE apoptosis was shown 0.23 ± 0.11 %. Patients with DME showed a significantly lowered RPE proliferation (0.82 ± 0.85 %) and apoptosis in comparison with control group (1.43 ± 0.32%, p=0.0014).

{"text": "Throughout the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas of the power of education and reason created new spaces to think and discuss philosophy and political issues concerning social reform. The American Revolution, French Revolution, and the Napoleonic wars created a new sense of nationalism and identity among European and American intellectuals as these thinkers began to question existing social, governmental and economic systems from the ground up. Throughout this tumultuous century, thinkers including Rousseau, Kant, Voltaire and Jefferson used the idea of the autonomous individual as a starting point for critique of traditional societal institutions and for outlining solutions to some of the worst humanitarian disasters of the time.\nThe works of Enlightenment thinkers often contain the idea that individuals are capable of developing the critical ability to reason and formulate independent ideas. They also assert that those ideas are capable of changing, developing and evolving in a way that can create reform within society in positive and powerful ways. In an age when most men and women felt powerless, these thinkers suggested new ideas about what power did not have to be tied to a monarch or a military force. Instead, they suggested the possibility of power coming from knowledge of oneself and those around him.\nOne of the ideas of the Enlightenment that would have a radical effect on society was the concept of \"freedom of speech.\" This idea came to fruition through the new philosophies of freedom and humanitarianism that were being introduced throughout Western Europe and the United States in the 18th century. In \"The Rights of Man\" Thomas Paine, a journalist, argued that all people are entitled to the same freedoms from government, regardless of social status or ethnicity. People were now believed to have more of an active role in the government of the society in which they lived.\nThroughout the 18th century, Enlightenment thinkers emphasized the need to challenge the political, religious and social beliefs and institutions of the time. One man who took this ideal and ran with it was Voltaire. Voltaire was a French Enlightenment writer, historian, philosopher and social commentator. His most famous work, \"Candide,\" is a satirical work in which a young man is raised to believe the earth is the best of all possible worlds, and once he sees how badly things can be, he concludes the best thing an individual can do is to live contentedly in a state of \"philosophical optimism.\"\nJefferson and Rousseau are two of the best-known Enlightenment thinkers of the age. Both men were born in the middle of the 18th century, and they had profound impacts on the events of the time. Jefferson was one of the founding fathers of the United States, and his most well-known work is the Declaration of Independence, which outlined the principles of government for the new nation. Rousseau, who was considered a champion of the common man, is known for helping to found the idea of the public good rather than the private or public. Jefferson and Rousseau were both social critics of the time and were important leaders in Enlightenment thought.", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "Despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in the way of musical numbers or dance scenes, probably having nothing to do with the film’s title. In fact, no musical at all! This picture was probably the film debut of one of Hollywood’s most legendary actresses, Veronica Lake, whose long, flowing curly “peek-a-boo” hair was used to full advantage during the film’s early sequences, giving her the nickname “The Vamp from Lake Pepin”.\nLake had made her debut only two years earlier in Sullivan’s Travels (1941) and did manage to garner minor roles in an additional 38 films until her unfortunate death at age 50 in 1973. The only song on this album features Lake’s only film duet with her co-star, John Carroll, singing the romantic “On The Wings Of Magic”.\nThe cast features a host of Hollywood veterans, including George O’Hara, who is credited with coining the phrase “talking pictures” upon seeing the first screening of The Jazz Singer (1927). In this film, O’Hara plays the villain of this story, but most famous for his portrayal of the title role in the original silent version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923).\nThe hero of the piece is John Carroll, the “King of the Broadway Musical, and a former partner of Noel Coward in producing Broadway productions such as The Dancing Years, The Chocolate Soldier, and Rosalie. Carroll is probably the only one here with the voice to bring this early stage show to life.\nThis film was based on a theatrical production of a play by Dorothy Baker (author of the novel The Little Foxes) originally known as “Moon-Light and Melody”. It is believed that the show debuted sometime around 1935 with Ruth Chatterton in the leading role of a movie star on the eve of divorce from her millionaire husband, played by John Carroll, who must decide between a comeback movie role and a chance at recapturing his starry wife’s heart.\nThe story begins the opening night party celebrating the marriage of Carroll’s character to his new bride, played by Veronica Lake. The picture quickly shifts to backstage, where a film director played by George O’Hara has just informed the actress playing Lake’s character that he is cancelling the film and going to marry his leading lady on-stage. The scene ends with a duet between Carroll and Lake, singing “On The Wings of Magic” on a rooftop.\nThe song was written for this film by Oscar-winning composer Ralph Rainger (“Thanks For the Memory”, “Brazil”, “Thanks to You”), and, although never nominated for an Academy Award, it certainly would have been a deserving choice along with the other numbers from this film in terms of the sheer number of singable verses.\nThe song’s opening verse provides a look at the story’s beginnings inside Carroll’s character’s home:\n“I was walking down the driveway of dreams/When the moon in the window smiled at me/And somewhere from a distant far,/Sparkled the eyes of the girl I love/On the wings of magic/On the wings of magic/She is my destiny/A fairy with charms,/On the wings of magic/On the wings of magic”.\nBy next verse, however, Lake’s character (and all their romance-related troubles) have entered the picture in a more-in-dept look at how their love lives are at once ruining and inspiring the film-within-the-film that they are currently filming:\n“She is a little girl with golden curls,/Her laugh a sweet little song,/And it echoes to the stars/When she holds the loves of my life in her arms,/On the wings of magic,/On the wings of magic”.\nThe film’s story then switches back to the night of the opening ball, and the duet between the two as they watch Carroll’s character get out of a cab and make his entrance into the party. They end the first half-chorus with a look at the challenges they each might face as they begin their new lives together (I think).\n“She has a little home with bows of daisies/On the wings of magic/The kindness in her smile/Sets me in the spell of the whole world/Through the years", "label": "llama"}

With the British army, he was posted in Afghanistan between 2013 and 2014. From there he joined the private security company Aegis Defence Services, which has been accused of “enabling and profiting from serious crimes” committed by the Afghan security forces. He served with the company in Iraq and again in Afghanistan. He returned to Afghanistan in 2016 where he was kidnapped by the Taliban. On 10 April 2017, Mr Jones was rescued by the French Special Forces – during the operation, an accompanying French soldier was killed and four Afghans were detained. Mr Jones says he was tortured by the Taliban for eight months.\nMajor Jamie Janes said the rescuers were in radio contact, but could hear his “screams”, and knew his injuries were serious. He said: “Soon after they had arrived, my rescuers said that I need to be evacuated immediately. The Special Forces team that I was with tried to stop the Afghan Taliban kidnappers from burning my body, but they would not allow it to be preserved.\nMajor Janes said: “I had lost both legs, I had major injuries to my arm, my jaw and I was on a drip for blood and fluid. I had a massive loss of blood.\n“In the first hours after I was kidnapped, I was in a lot of pain, and was in shock and suffering from mild hypothermia. My body then went into a state of shock. The only thing I thought of was my friends, my family, the family I had in Afghanistan and my work colleagues. I feared the worst.\n“My colleagues came to see that my rescuers, the French Special Forces, had been successful in getting me out of that situation that I was in… In that moment I didn’t think I was going to be alive the next day.\nMajor Janes added: “There was a lot of pain, a lot of infection, you’re scared, you’re cold – especially with it being that particular time in the season. I was in the back of a truck and it felt like the entire journey.

The Middle Rhine, like the Upper and Lower Rhine, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area between Linz am Rhein and Bingen am Rhein was declared a heritage site in 2002. In these 65km, the Middle Rhine boasts a total of 40 castles.\nThe Middle Rhine valley is a hugely popular touristic destination. The river is part of the legendary “Romantic Road”, which connects the North Sea with the Mediterranean. A few kilometers downstream from Bingen am Rhein, the river crosses the border from Germany to the Netherlands.\nThe steep and spectacularly shaped cliffs on both sides of the river as far as Linz am Rhein are also a popular destination for bikers, climbers and walkers.\nThe Middle Rhine is part of a landscape, which is characterized by very special features :\n•\ta natural riverbed, formed by glacial movement more than 10.000 years ago\n•\tvery steep, almost unnavigable riverbeds, often cut across in the upper and lower areas on either side of Rüdesheim\n•\tshaped valleys, often divided up with high stone walls, forming narrow chasms and deep gorges\n•\ta strong presence of man-made constructions: castles, vaults, basements, buildings and stone walls on either side\nThe Middle Rhine landscape is as stunning from the water as from the vantage point of one of the many castles built upon its rugged banks.\nTo give you a better idea of the topography, have a look at the following aerial photos of each of the ten castles located along the shores of the Middle Rhine:\nTourist infrastructure along the Middle Rhine is well established and of high standard. All towns and cities along the river have very good cycling paths, making cycling a pleasurable activity along the Riverbanks.\nCastles are open all year round. Most villages and cities have their own small market in the summer months. The most famous town is undoubtedly Rüdesheim am Rhein, home to Siegfriedstraße, the Drosselgasse, and the Marksburg Castle.\nDue to steep slopes, the river has more than 20 locks to allow safe passage for the vessels. Along the length of the Middle Rhine from Linz to Bingen, you find twelve locks in the upper section and another ten in the lower section.\nFrom Linz am Rhein to Bingen am Rhein, the river can be accessed at: Hahnweiler, Neuburg (Rüdesheimer) Lock, Hohenbueren (St. Goar), St. Goarshausen (St. Goar, Niederwasser) Lock, Kaub, Neubronn, Trechtingshausen, Bacharach, Assmannshausen, Rüdesheim (Siegfriedstraße) and Bingen am Rhein.\nTo access the castles directly for a closer look (and for the experience of climbing up on top of them, if you dare!) - and to enjoy a more stunning view of the River, you need to pass through one or more of the locks, the upper section of which is from Linz to St. Goarshausen and the lower section from St. Goarshausen to Bingen. There are more than twenty locks on the Middle Rhine.\nThe Middle Rhine is one of the busiest commercial river routes in the world. Vessels on both the German and the Dutch side of the river handle the majority of imports and exports between countries.\nThe Rhine is the most important waterway in Germany and is connected to the Danube at Kelheim. In Bonn, the Rhine separates the North from the South Rhine, and, from there, it flows into the Netherlands and on to the Schelde Estuary and from there to the Atlantic Ocean by sea.\nIn total, the 1300km long Rhine flows through the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg before finally reaching the delta in Belgium. However, the Rhine River (like many of the other rivers in the area) is actually formed not at its mouth, but at Mainz, where it is formed by the confluence of the Main, the Neckar and the Danube.\nIt flows through the Rhine's central district like a ribbon through the air.

{"text": "At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims who were also under the control of the Sufi orders. It is possible that the Mongols' Sufi followers introduced to the Mongols the idea of building their own independent state, with Genghis Khan as its head and leader.\nIt is also possible that, as the Mongols expanded their territories, they found Muslims who were practicing a separate religion and a separate civilization which the Mongols could accept without giving up their own identity. Mongols have always had a great respect for the power of the Turkic tribes and the Persian-speaking peoples, and in the 12th century many had already heard wonderful tales of their great civilizations. By this time the Mongols' own tribal religion had already undergone Christianization; in their new empire the Mongols found many Christian as well as Muslim believers in the religion they admired most.\nBecause the Mongols' way of life had become more \"civilized\" during the preceding centuries, they could be more amenable to adopting religious practices that the nomadic Mongols of the 13th century did not know: for example, the Mongols could become followers of Islam. However, because the Sufi orders that were becoming increasingly powerful among the Mongols were able gradually to modify many Mongol religious ideas so as to make then compatible with the basic doctrines of Islam, they were not forced to become Muslims in order to be active practitioners of the faith.\nThe Mongols themselves believed that the Mongol state was the source of their worldly strength and therefore regarded it as the source of their religious power, not the Sufi orders. Consequently, when any Mongol who wanted to live as a Muslim became one, the Mongol state allowed him or her to do so and offered the new convert financial and military support until the Muslim reached that point in religious practice known as \"having reached certainty\" about Islam's being correct.\nBecause of their admiration for Islamic civilization and because, under the influence of Islamic religion and the Mongol Khanates of Central Asia were able to provide economic and cultural support for the Turkic and other Muslims, the Muslim Mongols gained more influence within the population of the Mongol Khaganates than they had in the earlier centuries. This, as well as the fact that their rulers became great patrons of architecture, painting, the arts, and crafts, eventually made the Mongols' descendants forget Mongolian traditions and even Mongolian language. Their descendants adopted from the Muslims their written characters and their culture. As a result of their Muslim practices, the Mongols became more like the Muslims and gradually began to forget their own language and culture. Consequently, the Mongols of the 13th through 15th centuries, including many of the descendants of Genghis Khan, converted to Islam, and most of the Mongols' descendants today are Muslims.\nThe Muslim Mongol dynasties that ruled in Persia were called Timurides. A famous Mongol emperor of the Muslim Timurid period was Abdalqadir ibn Nasir-Allah, who ruled in the 15th century and left his name to the capital of the state he built, Damghan, as well as to his descendant, whom the Mongols considered as a saint and as the son of Allah, and whose most holy name was called \"Abdalqadir.\"", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "Based on an actual story, John Boorman shows the struggle of the working class as they are thrown at any of the injustices you can imagine and shows how they pull together to help each other to get through it all. While the film shows the brutality and the suffering of the day to day working class struggle for survival against a hostile ruling class, it also shows the strength of the spirit when you pull together with your friends. This is a film made in an era of British cinema where the government was looking to move away from realistic portrayals of working class life and this would have the studio put the kybosh on this film and not allow it to be released. Luckily Boorman had the faith in the project to not back down and release it. As a result it is one of those great films that would have really helped us to understand the current situation we find ourselves in today. The film was based on a book that was written by John Sutherland and published a year after his death.\nThe film tells the story of Sean Mercer, a hard working young man from Yorkshire who is married to Mary and they have a son called Martin. Unluckily Sean is a man who makes the mistake of asking for a pay rise, after he had been told that the company were looking to take on the work that his boss was doing. That mistake turns quickly into disaster when Sean is unceremoniously sacked with no warning, leaving his family without an income. With his job the life is also taken away from him with only a bleak damp grey factory as his new scenery and he ends up working in a job that he has no experience in or qualifications for. Things begin to get a little better for Sean when he lands a new job at a local railway signal box. However it is all too short lived as he is called out on an emergency at night with his son going out to help an injured worker, where he is tragically killed and the story turns into a race against time to get to his wife and see if they still have a future. Despite the tragic turn, the film shows the best of the human spirit at the time that when we pull together that we can rise above the terrible situations that we find ourselves in.\nThe film is very much as bleak as it should be for the characters and there is hardly a ray of sunshine to lift the spirits. The film was released a year after Callan, another bleak film that told the story of the untold violence and hostility that the working classes where subjected to by the government and the press at the time. The film does go to great lengths to pull out all the gory details that are associated with the coal mining industry and show the horrible turn that can occur when you are faced with the brutality of unyielding authority. This is an aspect to the film and the real life character is very much as important as the characters that we have seen from the Hollywood portrayals of miners. It is a little surprising that the film has never had a release on DVD, in a way it is probably for the best because the film could have been lost to time and now people could see exactly how bleak the times were. The film doesn’t just show Sean’s life and his struggle to cope with the loss of his son, the world is shown to be a bleak dark hole where the only things worth working for is to keep yourself alive.\nThe film has the classic set up of an innocent man being caught up in some kind of situation that they do not fully understand. They soon find themselves at the mercy of a corrupt system that is looking down on them without a caring thought in the world. Boorman shows their suffering and how they pull together to see if they can somehow fight the odds that stacked up against them. The film is well acted by a cast that would have starred in television drama at the time and the cast were all experienced enough to know that they were involved with important film. There is also an amazing theme tune to the film that really gives the film a feel the real film. The characters are what really make the film work and their resilience in the face of adversity is what you really pull for.\nThe film is based around a true story and John Boorman had the foresight to see a film that would show the working classes with the struggles that they went through to just survive when it came to life at the time. This film really should have received an award as a way of saying thank you for telling the real story behind the working class struggle and showing another side to the industry. There is little glamour in this film, in fact I would say that it is just the opposite as it shows the harsh reality of", "label": "llama"}

Tier 1 is the lowest grade and Tier 3 is the worst. Tier 3 countries are subject to a range of sanctions including suspension of non-humanitarian, non-trade related US Government aid. There are only 4 countries with Tier 3 status: Myanmar, North Korea, Sudan and Zimbabwe.\nSection 107 is an exclusion on the TIP report about the country's law enforcement capacity. The US State Department has no problem with Vietnam.\nSection 111 is an exclusion called Tier Placement regarding whether or not Vietnam is a Tier 3 country at the latest point of the report being compiled. Vietnam was not a Tier 3 country in 2006 or 2007.\nAs I recall from the 2007 TIP report on Vietnam, there were no specific Vietnam facts cited and there was no Vietnam country profile, which is available for many other countries.\nTier 2 ranking is for countries that are making some effort against human trafficking but have significant problems with the crime such as the government fails to investigate, prosecute and punish offenders. In 2009, Vietnam appears in this category.\nAs for the specifics of Vietnam's 2009 TIP score, the US State Department cites information from its own internal and government officials in Vietnam and Vietnam-based NGOs to the effect that the Vietnam government is \"ineffective\" in combating sex trafficking and that corruption continues to hamper Vietnam police efforts to investigate and prosecute crimes.\nBased on the Vietnam-specific assessments of these conditions, and in the absence of information showing otherwise, there are reasonable grounds to conclude that Vietnam is a country \"that is not in compliance with minimum standards established by the TIP [Trafficking in Persons] 2009 for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with those standards\"; making it a Tier 2 country on trafficking in 2009.\n\"TIP 2009 Tier 2 ranking is reserved for countries that have governments failing to meet their commitments to address trafficking and protect victims of trafficking by not meeting the Trafficking Victims Protection Act's (TVPA) minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards.\"\nThis is a Tier Placement in 2007 where countries not already listed as Tier 3 may be placed based on the availability of other information, including assessments or reports by non-governmental organizations and/or media accounts.\nVietnam was placed in Tier 2 in 2007 as a Tier Placement. The Tier Placement in 2007 is the first time Vietnam has appeared on the Tier 2 list, and Vietnam now appears on the Tier 2 list again for 2009.\nThis is the \"Government responses\" section.\nFor Vietnam: \"The Government of Vietnam made progress in combating trafficking in 2008, especially in identifying trafficking victims and referring them to government shelters, but trafficking victims continued to face long-term institutionalization in Vietnam's social welfare system.

{"text": "The motion picture, television, and music industry is centered on Los Angeles in California and New York City in New York and Atlanta in Georgia.\nThe motion picture production and distribution industry is controlled in Los Angeles by large studios that produce some of the most popular and successful films in history. It also includes many small, independent film studios such as Miramax, Sony Pictures, and Warner Bros. Although Hollywood, in Los Angeles, has been historically considered the center of the motion picture industry, companies, such as Apple, IBM, Verizon and others, have begun to use their marketing influence to open offices in cities such as Brooklyn, Berlin, and London.\nMost major motion picture studios own theme parks as a way of enhancing their brands and promoting the movies they have in production. However, with the decline in DVDs and the rising popularity of streaming services, the rise of Hollywood's major theme parks has begun to taper off as has the rise of all amusement parks. In recent years, as part of an all property revitalization plan, several motion picture and television studios have started building theme parks in areas that house the studios. These include the Walt Disney Company's Shanghai Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland.\nThe television and radio industry is also centered in and around Los Angeles and New York City, with the two major American broadcast networks located in both cities. Most large cable networks are also located in these areas with Turner Broadcasting's head office and MTV Networks located in New York City, while many other smaller cable networks are headquartered in Los Angeles. In the television industry, the city of Atlanta, Georgia has become home to many scripted dramas, sitcoms, and animated series as its state subsidies for productions have made the city increasingly affordable for productions, with more than 25 television series filmed in the city as of 2016.\nThe music industry is divided into several different sectors, including record labels, radio stations, audio equipment manufacturers, music publishers, retail store-fronts, and artist managers. Although most of the major music labels are headquartered in New York City, large parts of the industry are also based in Los Angeles, such as the Universal Music Group and the Interscope Geffen A&M Records division.\nOther major music industry companies, such as Capitol Records, have headquarters elsewhere. Capitol Records is based out of Los Angeles, while Warner Music Group is based out of New York City, and Sony Music Entertainment is based out of Midtown Manhattan. Record labels do not usually own recording studios but rather rely on independent recording studios outside the studio that are not owned by record labels.\nThe United States also produces more independent films than any other country, with some of the top film schools being found in states like New York and California. In the United States there are a host of independent production companies, television stations, film studios, radio stations, sound production companies and other media companies such as PBS (a major public television station), HBO, Netflix, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. There have also been attempts to re-imagine how media is distributed or used with the emergence of web series, cable TV channels, and video-on-demand services, as well as the popularity of subscription streaming services and online television network series.", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "this paper presents a novel method for determining the probability distribution of a time series model using sample average of a large set of time series instead of using a full Bayes factor for the final comparison with the proposed model. This method is applied to the analysis of a large dataset of the interferometric data from solar observation missions and comparison of different non-stationary time series models is performed. The main objective of this work is determining the most appropriate model among the competing candidates. In order to do this we need a method to find the relative probability between the different models, this is the main challenge of this work. In order to perform this task we apply four different methods; 1. Full Bayes factor, 2. Sample average, 3. Kullback Leibler and 4. Bayes risk, to compare the relative probability of two models given the data. Using one sample average is used in most previous work. In this paper we show that this method has a major deficiency in that it can give incorrect results if the population is large and the data is too sparse. In this situation, using only one sample average may give unjustified conclusions. We demonstrate this situation in the results section where we show that in some cases using only one sample average can result in the model being a poor choice when the probability it has relative to any other model is 99 percent. In the second section, we introduce a two sample average technique which is a simple extension of the one sample average technique introduced in the first section. The main idea is that a full Bayes factor cannot be found, because it is usually too large (numerically infinite) or zero which is undesirable, so a series of noninformative priors is used to ensure feasibility. Therefore the use of noninformative priors requires a change in the sample average calculation. This problem has been tackled in the past by either using improper priors where the posterior becomes flat and unhelpful or using specific sampling methods, a more suitable method is used here based on a simulation technique. The simulation is used to generate data using the model to be compared with sample averaged from the observed data. The posterior is then constructed from the resulting data. In order to generate noninformative priors, we consider a Bayes risk instead of a Bayes factor for the model to be compared and a general form of the sampling method is obtained. Using the noninformative priors, a suitable sampler, and the general form of the sampling method, it is shown that using the same noninformative priors for each sample in the sample average calculation gives good results. The third section applies this form to different non-stationary time series models of solar data to determine the relative probability between each model of the same system and each other models. The main idea is to estimate how well the model describes the data, and use this to determine how suitable it is. The aim of finding which model has the highest probability as is the case with most recent approaches based on full Bayes factor, instead we use prior information to aid the prior in the same way that in the past a flat prior has been used for improper priors where all other information about the sample is unrelated to the model. We show that by using our form we can obtain higher probability values by selecting the model that gives the best fit on the observed data, rather than the model that performs best in terms of information criterion, i.e. Aikaike information or K-L. We consider four different non-stationary models, each of which has been proposed and used in previous work on solar data. In terms of information criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, Aikaike Information Criterion and Kullback - Leibler Divergence, all show that the best fitting model is the Markov Chain model. However using the same prior for each model gives different results due to the specific sampling methods and the noninformative priors as previously discussed. In conclusion, the main aim is to provide a united argument in the analysis of the large datasets in the interferometric observations of the Sun. This paper suggests that this sample average technique is superior and more robust and more effective and is easily applied to the analysis of the data and in many situations may give significant advantages. The use of data in a Bayes factor analysis as in the past, can give misleading results in that, the full Bayesian factor is numerically infinite or zero which can give a model that is highly unlikely to be a best fit. Using a simple extension to solve this problem of using noninformative priors, can significantly improve the use of the Bayes factor in the analysis of the data obtained as a result. This has numerous applications in a large set of time series data analysis problems.\nurn:nbn:se:bth-8259 (URN)", "label": "llama"}

What makes me different from my peers?” The questions that we can ask to get to the answer (innocent and naive as they are) have power.\nIn college I started a group to try to learn about being Jewish. It was a good experience on many levels, but nothing clicked with my curiosity.\nIn my professional career, I have had a variety of jobs in different industries, from financial services to healthcare. I tried to do work that I believed in and that I was good at, with a focus on serving the clients’ needs and ensuring their success and satisfaction.\nI joined the Tory Burch Foundation to do similar work in the social sector, particularly helping women launch and sustain their own businesses so that they, their families and their communities can thrive.\nI learned during my career that the intersection between business, service and social justice is fertile ground for entrepreneurs to innovate. Businesses that have an element of service to their enterprise tend to flourish by doing good in the world. Consumers become fans of a brand when it is doing good and they can align with that work.\nHow have you, personally, been involved in entrepreneurship?\nI am a lifelong entrepreneur. I was always trying to start my own businesses in college, and then, out of necessity when I graduated, I started my own small consulting firm. It is something that I’ve done for most my professional career. In the years leading up to joining Tory’s team, my husband and I started a company that he bought out of his parents’ clothing company. From the beginning this has been my business.\nIt’s been great to see my daughter growing up and wanting to have her own business someday. I am happy to be able to use my experience to help her learn and be successful. I want her to understand what she needs to do on a personal and professional level so that she can be her own boss one day.\nI’ve really enjoyed working in tandem with Melanie – we share the same values, ideas, and perspectives. There is a lot that goes into this work. There are the challenges of the day to day that require your energy and attention.\nWe’re working on a five year program and we are building a set of programs that are working. We are taking the learnings from these programs and rolling them out in multiple locations and leveraging our internal staff to ensure the replication of this work.\nWe’ve also had some hiccups along the way: how do you pivot your program when you are facing a barrier? How does a change in leadership or the community around a program affect the day-to-day?\nWe are dealing with these inevitable challenges that are part of any organization, and trying to learn from them. Melanie and I have had the same view of doing this type of work and it’s been great to be able to work together on this and make our program stronger and effective.\nWhat have been the most memorable experiences from you have had in your career thus far?\nWhen I was a young lawyer – and I’ll say junior partner – I remember sitting in front of a corporation saying, “We would like to be your lawyers” and having the president of that company look right in my eyes and say, “We would like to be your clients” – that was a great moment for me.\nMy second career moment in law and business was starting my own law firm. I remember being successful and taking home the amount of money that I worked to earn – I could buy the house that I wanted and my daughter was able to go to private school. I was thrilled with my success but I also remember having that little fear of the day that I would have a hardship. Having that security of taking my success as well as my little girl and feeling like my family is safe.\nMy third success moment in business was when I started the company that I bought out of and selling it to my husband. I’m not an entrepreneurs first and foremost – I’m a businessperson. Some people will tell you that they are entrepreneurs first and the business comes second. I am a business person first and entrepreneurs second – sometimes we call our self “social entrepreneurs” and I’m fine with that. I like that language, that term. But I see entrepreneurship as an extension of the business side of you – we’re trying to build up our community and get a return on our community’s investment.\nMy next greatest success moment was when our TBF program was named a Top-Rated", "label": "llama"}

As part of the european union s asylum, migration and integration fund ( eu aid ), 200 million will be dedicated to the support of people from war-torn countries as they settle in europe.\nThe eu will use 850 million euros for all programs within the eu s external borders security funds and 1.2 billion ( 750 million euros from the eu, to be combined with 450 million euros from other countries ) for the humanitarian support of refugees and asylum seekers residing in the eu.\nThe new commitment is the result of a negotiated position among the 28 member states, led by the current holder of the eu s rotating presidency, cyprus. This money will focus on improving the legal status of refugees, asylum and integration, which are often inadequate, and on strengthening programs for improving the living conditions of refugees and asylum seekers.\nFor this purpose, the plan provides for the creation of an asylum assistance and legal support program, coordinated by the european c ommission, aimed at helping refugee families who cannot return to countries where they came from or are not allowed to do so.\nThe assistance will be given to the countries in the eu, but also to their counterparts in the balkans, north africa and the middle east.\nIn this regard, the german government has expressed its readiness to provide 100.5 million euros for the creation of an emergency resettlement assistance program, to facilitate the repatriation of refugees and the voluntary return of illegal migrants to their home country.\nTo support the countries on the edge of the eu s external borders, 1.17 billion euros will be used to support humanitarian needs, such as reception, assistance and integration of people that have escaped from their home or are fleeing the violence that accompanies migration phenomena from their countries of origin.\nEuropean commission president Jean-claude juncker spoke of a plan that was ready to be used as soon as needed.

For that, I think it was a very well-crafted and well-written story.\nThe characters are very believable and the writer describes them in a very expressive manner. Through the book, the writer manages to make characters like Tory, the protagonist, so attractive, sensitive, funny, loving, compassionate, humble and intelligent, that I was immediately taken by her. She is one such strong, beautiful and loving girl, that I felt proud to know her. I found her attitude to people and life very impressive, how she was able to take care of people’s feelings without getting hurt herself. She has the same kind of attitude that people generally associate with men rather than women. Tory as a character, is so strong and courageous, I found her role in helping the people and the way she did it, very inspiring. The writer manages to make character of Tory so empathizing that, I wanted to know her better, I wanted to get to know all those around her, know everything about them. The other character, with whom the story revolves, is her love interest, Kyle. Initially, he is not a likable character, but after a while he evolves into a character that becomes very close to heart. He was so funny and charming, I became fond of him in no time. All in all, the characterization was brilliant and the author has managed to make all the characters very well-defined and expressive, this story is like a roller coaster of emotions where it takes you from happiness to sorrow. Tory and Kyle are such a very charming couple, you can’t help but become fond of them. Tory as a character was very special, she is very understanding and a compassionate soul who helps who help others around her, she is also very intelligent, she is well aware of the situation and works carefully on every situation. When I had read the last part of the book, I did not want the story to end, I was very disappointed when I reached end of this book because I wanted to know more of Tory and Kyle’s life. Because as much as I liked reading about them, reading about Tory’s life and her struggles had fascinated me, reading about the way how she helps women out with their personal matters, it was such an inspiring story. I was amazed how easily the writer describes the romance between a woman and a man, they both have such a beautiful romance between them, that I did not even feel the need to find any flaws in the romance of Tory and her love interest.\nI loved the love story Tory and Kyle develops. This romance was so beautiful and unique, it is so unlike the kind of stories and movies that we normally read. The romance develops very naturally for Kyle and Tory. It was not like any other romance, because this story is so unique that the characters fall for each other, because they need each other, these characters needed each other. I loved Kyle and Tory both as a couple and as individuals. Kyle was very fun, he was a perfect gentleman and the way he treats Tory was so sweet and tender. Tory was a perfect partner for Kyle; she helps him in every possible way. Kyle is an amazing man", "label": "llama"}

Mean macular thickness in glaucomatous eyes was greater\nthan in the control group (6.89 mm vs. 6.51 mm, respectively, ), and macular\nthickness was greatest in the non-glaucoma eyes (7.54 mm). The mean macular\nthickness values in glaucoma and non-glaucoma eyes were,, respectively.\nMacular thickness\nwas related inversely to BCVA and significantly to IOP and optic disc\ncannulae area. Conclusions Macular thickness with optical coherence tomography is\nhigher in patients with glaucoma than in those without glaucoma, regardless of age, and is\nlowest in non-glaucoma eyes. This trend was significant in glaucoma eyes, but it did\nnot hold in the group of patients without glaucoma. In a smaller subgroup\nof patients who underwent intraocular pressure measurements and optical coherence\ntomography imaging, macular thickness was also significantly correlated\ninversely to intraocular pressure. Therefore, macular thickness appears to be a\nmeasure of anatomical damage that increases with age and progresses gradually in\nthe presence of glaucoma.\nKeywords: Optical. coherence\nimaging Macula Glaucoma\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new imaging tool with high\nspatial and temporal resolution, and it has been used in many areas of ocular\nresearch [1]. OCT can be used to measure axial, radial, and temporal structural\nchanges in intraocular disease. One of the most significant applications of OCT\nhas been glaucoma imaging [2,3].\nOCT has been recently used to measure the macular thickness, especially in\nthe investigation of glaucoma, but little information is available about the\nrelationship between the value of optic nerve head (ONH) structure and visual\nfunction [4-7]. Theoretically, if structural macular changes are related to pathological\nchanges in the ganglion cells and nerve fiber layer (NFL) with which the\noptic nerve is in direct contact, the macular thickness in glaucoma patients may\nbe greater than that in non-glaucoma patients [8-10]. The macular\nthickness may become an important parameter in the diagnosis of glaucoma and a\nmethod of early detection.\nIn the initial report, the macular thickness in glaucoma patients was\nhigher than in eyes with normal optic nerve head imaging [11,12].\nSimilarly, macular thickness was higher in glaucomatous eyes than in healthy\nor normal eyes in other studies [13,14].\nIn a study performed in our department, some glaucoma patients with\nprogressive damage to the retinal nerve fiber layer had lower macular\nthicknesses than did eyes with no or minimal damage. It is, therefore, possible that\nmacular thickness could be an early indicator of damage to the retinal ganglion\npale. In an attempt to clarify the relation between macular thickness and\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) on glaucoma eyes and in eyes from a control\ngroup, we evaluated the variations in macular thickness in patients with\nmaculopathy and in the control group. In addition, we evaluated the correlations\nbetween macular thickness and age, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)\non ophthalmologic examination, and the presence of glaucoma, based on IOP.\nCategorical variables are reported as frequency and percentage. Continuous\nvariables were presented as means or standard deviations. Group variation was\nanalyzed using the chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. Correlation between two or\n", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because of the fact that it is about tech bros in Silicon Valley. I really enjoy watching technology geeks and nerds succeed on screen, so the combination of an interesting love story and some nerds working in tech made this movie really attractive for me.\nAnthony is a Silicon Valley programmer who works for a tech giant in the Valley. He’s living together with his best friend Mike and working every day on the next iteration of a mobile app that lets people “swipe” potential life partners. One evening at a party, Anthony is confronted by the girl in the next barstool, whose name is Ashley. In a haze of alcohol, he decides to swipe her, and she responds positively as well. From that day on, they start to see each other. However, neither one wants to start a relationship due to some personal issues they have with themselves and other people in their lives.\nBut soon they start dating and things get complicated. Anthony has a best friend, Mike, who just broke up with his girlfriend, so they’re all still sort of dealing with their respective losses. Anthony gets a new, exciting job and this leaves him increasingly conflicted about his future, his career and the possible future with Ashley. And Ashley herself has a lot of things going on her life, too, such as whether or not someone should get a divorce or not, or where to live and things like that.\nYou see, I found that very relatable, because we all have these kind of unresolved issues that don’t necessarily come to a head. We’re all trying to do our best and figure out our lives. I loved that this movie shows you two people in their early 30s that don’t know what they’re doing with their lives or where they’re going next and that they really have to sit down together and go through all of this stuff. You have a guy who’s sort of an entrepreneur and just can’t settle down — you have this crazy-good coding background and he’s thinking about how his parents will say when he takes a step like this [with Ashley]; you also have an architect who is married and who is actually getting a divorce but isn’t ready to just dive into it completely. So this whole movie is a study about the life of people who are still figuring out their lives, while facing these sort of major crises in other areas of their lives.\nWhat also was fascinating is that the two main actors — Jesse Plemons and Maya Rudolph — are married in real life. I found the chemistry they developed on screen to be very convincing. It shows that, especially with a couple in your 30s, it takes a lot of work to make something work. You sort of have to face the music and be honest and really talk about the issues and the problems, so I thought the relationship on screen was really well developed. I also thought it was amazing how the movie explores issues like “how do you deal with your past?” and “how do you deal with the people you love in your past?” as well as “what about your family — do you stay in touch with your past or live fully your life?”. And the whole thing with technology and the mobile app was just fascinating. Ashley really enjoyed the app and saw it as a tool to find love. But also, I noticed that there aren’t anymore people in relationships that meet at bars. They all seem to be on some online dating site that has them using their mobile devices to meet other single people. So I thought it was really nice to see that there’s a kind of alternative way of meeting people to explore romance.\nSo, let’s see! I’m really curious to hear about other movies you’ve seen lately — what are your favorite Netflix titles nowadays? Share them in the comments below.\nI’m not a movie buff, but I did like this movie. 🙂 Maya Rudolph is definitely a talent to watch.\nI recently saw the Netflix Originals The Perfect Date. It is light-hearted, funny, with a lovely romance. But the romance was not a big deal compared to the comedic value of this movie. I think the 2 movies are quite different.\nThe Perfect Date was a cute show and I’m looking forward for the second season.\nThanks for stopping by! I’m glad you liked my article.

{"text": "This little two-person movie is actually much bigger than it initially appears. It starts off as, yes, a little 2D romcom, but soon evolves into a story about relationships of the platonic and romantic variety. The cast is full of people you might not recognize, and the movie has an awkwardly funny sense of timing, in both the dialogue and the use of sound effects, which you can tell is coming from a play. There is also an interesting way director Kevin Allen treats the relationship between the main character, an overly anxious and self-hating film composer, and his sister. I found the movie engaging, and I’d like to see more from Kevin Allen.\nHad no idea what the title meant until the end. I thought it meant something to do with darts, or maybe golf. Apparently a bouncing ball. It’s the story of the world’s greatest darts player. It takes place in the eighties and features the music of the time, in the same way that Goodbye Lenin did for the nineties. So there’s a lot of U2, Culture Club, The Smiths, The Cure to throw back to back with the darts match. The world’s greatest dart player of the eighties was actually a woman. It’s a very understated movie that does not feature a lot of action. It focuses on the relationships within the circle of friends of the protagonist, a failed musician, who goes from being a nobody to having money, but losing everything he cares for. There’s a lot of humor and some heartbreak. As an added bonus, a good bit of the music in this movie actually was from the eighties, as were the styles and colors of the fashions the subjects were wearing.", "label": "llama"}

Enabling JavaScript in your browser will only take a moment.\nThe Sowing\nOlivia Cutts, who narrates the piece, explains the project’s origins.\nGolden Bough began because I was at an Art History conference and I heard all these different languages and I was just sitting there in silence, and I started to think how interesting it would be if we had some way of introducing ourselves and hearing about the different cultures and histories that we all ascribe to and make such a huge part of our lives.\nWhat we do in Golden Bough is we ask people to describe aspects of themselves by their language. So we say, “Hello, what’s your name?” And then they reply “Matthew (or Joanne, or Joe, or whatever their name is), but I’m also known as Matthew (or Joanne or Joe).” And you can learn a bit about their background, where they’re from and their history.\nWhat makes the project unusual is that people don’t normally introduce themselves this way. They often have a name that people know or associate them with, but they always seem to have another, lesser known name and it’s interesting to hear why people choose their particular name, so in a way, that’s what we’re working to uncover.\nThe audio is then transcribed and translated into the different languages, so a French speaker, for example, hears another French speaker say, “Hello. My name is Joanne, but I am also known as Marie.” Then Marie hears another French speaker, so you have this sort of dialogue between two people, so one has the English introduction, the French translation, and then French-Arabic and French-Arabic translation.\nSo we’re trying to create an international dialogue. Also, we want to be able to provide people with a sort of language learning tool, so in some sense, you can learn a new language in the same way that you would by trying to learn the language in a conventional way.\nIt’s been amazing for me – personally – to become more involved in the French-Arabic language because I’m not a linguist and I’m not actually French. I’m an Australian, but I’m trying to become more aware of the relationship and the links between all these languages.\nAs Olivia says, hearing all the different languages has been fascinating. All these very different people are in the project.\nOne of the things I actually wanted to do in Golden Bough was to hear all of the different, weird languages that people use. In a way, that’s like being at a festival; there’s always different cultures.\nI’m interested in different cultures, you know, in different languages because they all have their histories and they all contribute to what we see as our own cultures and languages. What strikes me most is everybody’s so different and they have some element of differentness in them; they share some things about their character, but they’re all different.\nEach project will be different. There’s always things I want to know, but the key thing is that you can participate in Golden Bough and you’ll be able to have a bit of an insight into a different person.\nIn the first instance there will be a bit of an identity crisis of “Oh my gosh, I am such a Joanne, but I’m also such a Marie, and I’m also such a Mathew.” And then there’s the realisation of actually how different people are and how they’re all from different nations, so it’s a great thing I think of how people all connect through this identity.\nThere are 60 languages spoken in Australia, so we’ve created a website so that if people go to www.goldenbough.com.au, they can hear some samples of the 60 languages spoken in Australia.\nIt’s a huge challenge because it’s a large project, and we’re trying to record about 15,000 people, so each person will be spoken to about 5 to 10 times, and it’ll be quite a commitment over a long period of time.\nI find that fascinating; that people are actually in the middle of this and they’ll eventually see", "label": "llama"}

The correctness requirement is that of a weak memoryless complete store where the message is guaranteed to be delivered at most one time period after it was sent.

It showed their true friendship.\nI would also like to add that this movie also makes me want to call a long time friend and check on them to see how they’re doing. I mean who says best friend forever anyways? That is how true these friends were!\nA lot of the times, in today’s day and age, people will say they are best friends or friends forever, but deep down they may be thinking, you’re only a good friend to me while times are good and we get along with each other. Where as these two friends, Nick and Schmidt, proved to one another that they would be there for each other, for good or bad. They even made a pact, in the movie, that when one of them was in trouble, both of them would show up.\nEven though times weren’t good for Schmidt, because of Nick trying to win over his girlfriend and friend to get her to like her, Schmidt still showed up for his friend. Schmidt’s whole character is hilarious! At first, Nick thought he was insane with the way he acts. But soon he realizes Schmidt is a really smart guy with great advice. It made me want to check up on a long time friend I grew up with because he helped me through a lot of issues.\nMy other favorite character in this whole movie was Jess’ character. Her boyfriend, played by Max Greenfield, is an idiot. In the middle of the movie he makes out with Jess and breaks up with her. WTF? Who breaks up with their girlfriends in the middle of the movie??! Whenever he made one of those moves, it was always followed by Jess getting really upset, not just looking hurt or not knowing what to say but really upset. Then Jess would go over to Nick, who would give her the right advice, just like Schmidt always did. Then Jess would go with Nick and end up kissing him and then bang! She and Nick were in a relationship.\nTo wrap up my review on this movie, I would have to say in the end that, whether you are friends, family or even best friends, be loyal to whoever you consider your friend!

Additionally, a penalty of $1,000 can be incurred for first-time offense, $2,000 for subsequent offenses.

{"text": "There were many religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty, such Buddhism, and, later, Nestorianism, but they all failed to unite the Chinese. The Chinese people continued to practice the old religions, worshipped the gods, and burned incense at their ancestral altars.\nWhen Kublai Khan became emperor of China, there were already six important religions, each of which had a different philosophy. These religions were Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, Nestorianism, Christianity, and Islam.\nAmong the Chinese, Confucianism was considered as the native religion, but Buddhism was the largest religion in the empire. Buddhism came to China from India in the 1st century BC, and spread rapidly throughout the country. Buddhism has four fundamental teaching: (1) there is no permanent soul, (2) there is no absolute truth, (3) good works are the means of liberation, and (4) there is no God.\nAs for Confucianism, it came from the teachings of Confucius (551-479 BC). Confucianism had three fundamental teachings: (1) the world is good, (2) people should obey their parents, and then (3) all the different rules were to be followed, and people could reach to Nirvana by doing good works.\nBoth Confucianism and Buddhism made many contributions to China's culture. Because of Buddhism, China had more advanced philosophy, and it also introduced a more complex Chinese literature. In 1054, a major debate took place in China between Confucian scholars and Buddhists. Although Confucianism proved the stronger religion, the Buddhists eventually succeeded to take over the Chinese literati.\nIn 1279, a Catholic priest, Giovanni da Montecorvino, was sent to China as its first Papal nuncio. Pope Gregory X sent missionaries to China in subsequent years. However, the mission was unsuccessful, and a Nestorian sect was established in China.\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1461-1644), religion took a back seat to politics. The emperors imposed a national orthodoxy on the people of China. They prohibited certain religious practices, such as Buddhist monasteries. This allowed the religion to survive in clandestine form.\nBy the 17th century, Protestantism was growing in southern China. In 1605, Christian missionaries landed on the island of Amoy (Hainan). They were welcomed by the Hainans, because the Nestorian Christians had been there before. They established Christianity on Hainan. In the 18th century, the population of Hainan was about 1 million people. They formed an isolated society.\nIn 1698, some southern Chinese Christians came to Beijing to present their views to the Emperor Kangxi. They wrote to him: \"Our ancestors had believed in your ancestors; then they abandoned their belief in Buddha. We are grateful for your emissaries and others that brought our Holy Scripture to us for study. May you accept our religion and become our god, so that your throne may not be shaken.\" However, the emperor was not as welcoming to the missioners. He replied: \"Christians believe you have abandoned the teachings of Buddha and embrace Christianity. If you do not do this, leave my gates immediately!\"\nConfucianism was still the main Chinese religion but there were many sects, the most important being Taoism which was a mixture of Shamanism and Confucianism.\nShamanism, which is still practiced in the mountains of the southeast where there is a very remote and inaccessible population of Taoist-Shamans, is found in the northern borderlands and in Tibet. Shamanism is a type of religious practice in which the spirit of the dead are thought to possess the living to heal them or foretell the future.\nBy the 13th century, there was also a group from Islam that called Hui who were mainly traders.\nIn the 11th century, Islam was brought to China from the Arabs. A Muslim historian, Ibn Khordabeg, wrote about it, and that he believed Muhammad was a prophet like Buddha and Confucius. Later, Muslims spread throughout southern China.\nMost of southern China became Muslim by the 13th century. After Muslim merchants carried the religion into southern China, Confucian temples and churches were all converted to mosques.", "label": "llama"}

In April 2007, BSkyB formed a joint venture with NBC Universal and the Discovery Networks in order to create a new joint subscription video on demand (SVoD) service, called \"Ask\" which was cancelled in 2010.\nToday, BSkyB now ranks among the biggest European pay-TV services in the United Kingdom, along with Virgin Media, which has 5.6 million subscribers and is now called BT TV. According to Ovum, in the last quarter of 2011, BT's market share of pay-TV market was around 45%, followed by Sky with around 55% market share.\nBT is the only UK telecom operator that offers its own TV service in competition with BSkyB, but BT's service is only widely available in London. Other than BT's TV service, BT is also the only operator in the UK that runs its own Internet service provider (ISP) broadband service.\nThe main BT TV service provides access to around 60 TV channels via a satellite dish or the BT Vision service. BT's BT TV service allows Internet streaming, as well as downloading and watching video through a BT box - similar to a Sky+ TV box.\nBT, along with Sky + TalkTalk, also provides the free TV licenses for customers.\nBT has recently expanded its business into content production, including shows like \"Midsomer Murders\" and documentary shows like \"Life of Mammals.\"\nIn July 2010, Virgin Media joined the European-based Freeview mobile TV service after BSkyB has joined the service in June 2010.\nBSkyB has also launched a new service called BSkyB Apps, and also BSkyB On Demand service.\nBSkyB entered into a deal with ESPN in October 2013 to launch BT ESPN in June 2014. BT ESPN has TV channels in the UK such as ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN3, ESPN and ESPN America.\nBSkyB also bought 75% of Luminato, an online TV network that targets Latin American and Argentine customers in June 2014.\nThe BSkyB brand is owned by BSkyB Group Limited, a publicly owned company on the London Stock Exchange listed under the ticker BSY.\nBSkyB was founded in London on 19 July 1990 by Jeremy Isaacs, who was appointed Chief Executive Officer by BSkyB when it was formally incorporated in 1990. He was originally head of Channel 4 Television and later Chief Executive of the newly created Channel Five.\nBSkyB was a public company, until 2006, when Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation bought 17.9% of the company's outstanding shares for £940 million for a 15.6% equity stake. BSkyB's shares rose 5% on the news of the deal. In June 2008, News Corp. increased its stake to 17.9% of outstanding shares, giving its stake to 19.97%. A month later, in July 2008, BSkyB increased its stake in Tele Norte Leste Participações of Brazil, and News Corp. increased its share in BSkyB to 18.4% of outstanding shares. In late 2008, BSkyB reduced its stake in Tele Norte Leste Participações to 2.8%. In January", "label": "llama"}

It was built around a 165-foot well which, when covered, enabled people to cross by foot or horseback directly over the river.\nOne of the city's most important museums, the MASP (Museu de Arte Sao Paulo) is home to one of the leading collections of the 20th century. It includes works by Brazilian, South American and European masters. The museum's building is also a masterpiece in itself. Made up of three interconnected pavilions by Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi, this impressive structure has been declared and protected by the Ministry of Culture as a National Architectural Landmark.\nThe museum is home to a great number of historical works, including sculptures by Rodin and Auguste Rodin, among others. Visitors can also explore various temporary exhibitions as well as an interesting collection of photographs, prints and drawings.\nThis is one of the city's largest theatres, built in 1903. It is one of the most important Brazilian theatres, home to plays by great writers such as Machado de Assis and Jorge Andrade and renowned for its excellent acoustics as well as a wonderful auditorium. It also houses the country's largest organ, a masterpiece built in France and one of the few still in operation in South America.\nThis former imperial palace is now home to a range of cultural and scientific activities. The Museu Paulista (Paulista Museum), one of the country's most important specialist museums, is housed here, as is the Museu Histórico Nacional (National Historical Museum), which tells the story of Brazil through objects, photographs and paintings.\nBuilt by renowned designer Oscar Niemeyer in the 1950s, this extraordinary building is famous for its curves, curled like a sea shell. It was inaugurated in 1954 and is now one of the Brazilian city's most important modernist museums. It houses the collections of Brazilian industrialist and entrepreneur Sérgio Milliciano, consisting of more than 25,000 pieces.\nLocated in the Praça da Sé, this is one of the country's most important Cathedrals (Igreja da Sé), famous worldwide for its breathtaking architecture. The 65-metre tall dome is the work of Aleijadinho, who completed the construction of this imposing building between 1770 and 1783.\nThis beautifully preserved building in the Centro Cultural São Paulo was the former headquarters of the state bank, the Banco da Equador. It was built in 1912 and is a good example of Italian Renaissance architecture. Following a major renovation, it is now a cultural centre which hosts exhibitions, and is home to the theatre, the concert hall, a library, a bookshop and the Brazilian Philharmonic (Filarmônica Brasileira).\nThis building was the former headquarters of the Companhia de Engenho. It is one of the city's most fascinating pieces of 1900s architecture, its walls made of large wooden beams and covered in rustic bricks. It is currently home to art exhibitions, theatrical performances and lectures.\nOne of the most important buildings in the city, the Edifício Martinelli was the work of the famous German-Brazilian architects Lúcio Costa and Affonso Reidy. In 1968, it was named one of the five best buildings of the decade by the American magazine Time. On the top of this striking building are twin cylinders, one of which is the elevator and the other a heliport for landing heliplanes on the roof terrace.\nLocated in the city's Central business district the building was one of the largest corporations in the city, the Seara Alimentos (Food Ingredients) company. This futuristic office building was designed to blend into the landscape of skyscrapers.\nA few metres from the building is the Pinacoteca of Sao Paulo, one of the country's first art museums, and a perfect neighbour for the Edifício Martinelli, which houses the Edifício Martinelli Cultural Centre (CCCM), the Cultural Centre of the Edificio Martinelli, which is one of these buildings that never cease to amaze.", "label": "llama"}

This study has led to the identification of multiple EHMT2 partner proteins that modulate the function of multiple Hedgehog pathway proteins and has provided insights into the potential regulatory role of EHMT2 in various cancers.", "label": "llama"}

The job in the USA would be only temporary and the company where I have taken up offers me to relocate and work from Australia. The work in US does not require me to travel much and hence it won't really hinder my family life. So my family would come with me to Australia, would I need to apply for any EOI?\nAs far as the current situation in Australia- my wife and I are in a very awkward phase right now. I'd like to say it isn't the ideal time but I guess I have no choice.\nI've read the thread and I guess you've already answered most of my questions in your own post.

It is only temporary. And it's a short term job with a firm of US so it may or may not be of use to me for Australia.\nIs this the job in which you have applied and got the job through? If it is so, then it is likely that this job doesn't require frequent travel and hence should not be a hindranceto your EOI application. The second reason would be based on the nature of the job where the firm has no branches or offices in Australia and hence no international presence.\nThe firm itself says that it is a temporary job, and even in the contract it is mentioned. So it would be interesting to note whether the contract stipulates travel at all.

{"text": "Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and smoke release high heat, which may produce severe damage, if it is not properly controlled.\nA fire can start as a result of many different causes including faulty electrical installations, the failure to keep flammable items properly stored, or the improper disposal of burning material.\nIn this module, we will consider some of the major hazards associated with fires and fire prevention.\nA fire can be defined as any self-sustaining, rapidly burning chemical redox process, the primary and secondary products of which are air and heat, with a net consumption of oxygen. Fires generally fall into two broad groups: solid fuel fires and gas fuel fires. Gas fuel fires use gas fuel such as natural gas, oxygen, or hydrogen. Solid fuel fires use solid fuel such as wood, coal, or other organic material.\nEarth’s atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%, by volume) and oxygen (21%, by volume). Approximately 20% of the air that we breathe is oxygen; however, the concentration of oxygen is 20 - 35% by volume in open air at or near sea level. A fire of any size can consume approximately 75 times the weight of material in oxygen alone, and a small fire will continue to consume oxygen in this ratio until the fire is extinguished. This process can be described using a chemical formula (such as NOx or COx), and the process can generally be characterized as either endothermic or exothermic, depending on the reaction. The heat release of a combustion process may also be described using a similar chemical formula; and the heat release process can generally be characterized as being endothermic or exothermic, depending on the reaction.\nA very common cause of a large fire is the careless disposal of cigarette butts. This careless throwing of lit cigarettes butts have resulted in forest fires in South Africa and Florida. These forest fires can burn for hundreds of years because the cigarette butts continue to burn.\nIf the cigarette butts are on the ground near dry grass, the fire can spread into nearby houses. If the grass catches the fire, it can spread quickly to the forest. A single cigarette butt can start a very large forest fire very quickly in a dry area such as Arizona because very little fuel may be needed to continue the chain reaction leading to the spreading of the fire.\nWhen a cigarette ignites a matchstick, the flame is hot and can burn for an extended period of time.\nAn open flame must be surrounded by a fuel, but the fuel must be burnable to enable combustion.\nMany of the fuels for a fire could be considered solids, liquids, or gases, depending on how the material is stored and measured. For example, liquid petroleum can be measured in either a gallon, or a litre, but the concentration of liquid fuel (such as gasoline or petroleum) may range as low as 82.4 litres per gallon when measured according to ASTM D4814 (ISO 900:2005 11568), to the standard litre measurement (1000 ml) used by the United States Department of Defense (DOD).\nSolid fuels, such as coal, wood, and charcoal, are normally measured as a percentage of their volume in air to their weight in oxygen.\nLiquid fuels are measured by volume of fuel to volume by weight in oxygen.\nThe specific gravity of a solid or liquid fuel (such as liquid petroleum) is the measure of the density of the fuel when compared to the density of water (0.998 at 20 oC). The specific density of a fuel is defined as the weight of a given volume of fuel to the weight of a gallon-sized volume of water, at the same temperature. The specific volume of a liquid fuel is defined in the same manner as the specific gravity of the fuel.\nCigarette butts, and other organic trash, can spread fires caused by cigarettes.\nIf the fuel for the fire is dry and flammable, as in a dry rain forest, or dry wheat fields in Europe during harvest time, the combination of heat from the fire with the wind can carry the fire in the direction of the wind.\nThis will cause the fire to spread rapidly, especially if the fuel is extremely dry. In Arizona for instance, the fuel is often very dry, when compared to other places such as forests.", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "hypertrophic pachymeningitis is an uncommon disorder that causes a localized buildup of tissue within the dura mater, the membrane covering the spinal cord and other nerve fibers. The excess tissue causes compression and inflammation resulting in localized back pain and in extreme cases can cause tethering and a narrowing in the openings through which spinal nerves travel. This can produce a painful condition and lead to irreversible neurologic damage. This is also referred to as tuberculous meningitis.\nA.T. Steuart, 1911 first identified hypertrophic pachymeningitis. He reported a case of a 17 year old boy with progressive worsening left lower extremity weakness. He was a tobacco chewer at times during the day. He first noticed inability to stand due to his left lower limb being weak. Nerve conductions studies revealed a decrease in motor NCV in both upper extremities. The boy was unable to stand by himself.\nHe was admitted to the hospital and had a diagnosis of acute radiculitis and hypertrophic pachymeningitis. The onset of symptoms was 4 weeks prior to admission. He was hospitalized for 7 months but remained bedridden after treatment.\nHypertrophic dura mater encephalophayi is the most common form of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, occurring in 90% of reported cases. The cause is unknown, although a causal relationship has been demonstrated in most cases to the following situations:\nRecurrent bacterial infections of the ear, mastoid, sinuses, or nasopharynx\nAntecedent viral infection, such as Epstein Barr or Varicella\nThe diagnosis is often more difficult than that of other forms of dural disease such as meningitis or meningocele. There is a wide differential diagnosis of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, some which may mimic the clinical features. These include:\nSquamous cell carcinoma causing spinal cord compression\nInfection of the spinal cord (meningitis)\nBrachial neuritis\nTumor infiltration\nOssification of the spinal dura\nThese and other disorders can cause similar manifestations and may be responsible for the onset of symptoms. However, the specific cause of the symptoms and signs is usually evident following diagnostic studies such as cervical and lumbar PDW, myelography, and CT of the cervical spine.\nPatients usually present with 1 of three primary forms of disease:\nThe classical syndrome of progressive worsening of the left lower extremity and weakness\nThe acute syndrome, characterized by an abrupt onset of paresis of lower extremities often accompanied by an increase in the sensory level\nPatients with myelitis often present with an acute myeloencephalopathy due to a posterior horn syndrome\nPatients present with complaints of backache and paresthesias, often with weakness and neurologic dysfunction of the left side of the body. The onset may be abrupt, evolving over days to weeks, or it may occur slowly over several months. Patients often complain of pain that worsens on walking or bending backwards. Numbness, pricking sensations, and coldness are noted along the posterior aspect of the thigh, medial aspect of the calf, and sole of the left foot.\nAn examination may reveal the classic signs associated with hypertrophic pachymeningitis such as:\nLow-grade fever with rigidity at the site of pain\nTenderness over the midline superior aspect of the left buttock\nThe presence of increased or prolonged reflexes\nDeep tendon reflexes and plantar responses are more brisk on the right\nSigns of a spinal lesion may be present. These include:\nNeurologic findings include:\nLoss of function, depending on the degree of the tethering and compression\nThere may also be a neurologic deficit on the right in the form of a decrease in lower extremity strength.\nMyelographs and CT scans of the cervical spine are recommended with the following findings:\nNo or minimal compression on the cord seen on myelography.

I strongly recommend movie-rating.com to watch this movie because it is very interactive with a lot of the action to keep the attention of the audience. The Glorious Celebration movie is a great movie so I believe it would really be a good watch for you too. Here’s the story: This animated cartoon, produced as a 40th birthday present to London, offers a whirlwind tour of some of the capital’s best-loved landmarks, from the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace and the London Zoo. The film traces the history of these locations, with colourful animation and cartoony sequences depicting the various historical events which occurred at the sites. All the popular tourist attractions are represented, with the Palace guards, Nelson’s column, the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral and Big Ben all playing a starring role. Although some of the dialogue is dubbed, most of it is narrated by the likes of Sir Laurence Olivier, James Mason, Paul Scofield and the cast of ‘Allo ‘Allo!.\nThe Glorious Celebration is a 2000 television film in which the history of London is told in ten chapters, each beginning, \"Long ago, in the early days of,....\" and \"Long ago, in the early days of,....\" by the narrator at the start of each chapter. Each chapter is centred on a well known building, statue or monument in London (except for the last one which is centred on the Thames waterfront itself). The documentary part of this TV documentary film is interspersed by \"live\" animated sequences, in which cartoonlike people and animals inhabit these famous buildings or places which they then describe. The narration, including the opening and closing passages, is accompanied by music, predominantly classical piano and organ music, and some songs from films or stage versions of plays (for example, \"Topsy-Turvy\", \"Les Misérables\") performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, with lyrics altered to convey a London aspect, sometimes to the point of parody. The film is designed to be used as either a stand-alone film for children to enjoy, or as a companion to the many guides to London.", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "[ purpose ] the aim of the present study was to investigate the association of 15 allele genotypes of the G allele for the TLR4 -23Ile polymorphism with the risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus in a Chinese cohort.\nThe present study consisted of two sets of patients: the first, from the Department of Dermatology at the University of Hong Kong, had a diagnosis of SLE. The study set consisted of a total of 153 patients. The second set comprised healthy women and men as a control group. The control group, recruited from the general population, consisted of 402 individuals. All of the subjects were Han Chinese.\nFor the detection of the TLR4 -23Ile polymorphism, Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed, which involves using single-step PCR containing two oligonucleotide primers, TaqMan probe, and Taq polymerase. The reaction was performed using a final reaction mixture comprising 12.5 pmol of each primer, 7.25 pmol of probe and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase using 25 mL of reaction buffer, 12.5 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl 2, 3 nM rDNA, 3.8 μg of BSA, and 1:100 dilution of genomic DNA. The reaction was incubated at 50°C for 30 seconds, 95°C for 5 minutes, and 40 cycles (denaturing step at 95°C for 30 seconds and annealing step at 60°C for 30 seconds).\nFor the genotyping of subjects, genomic DNA was extracted from 500μ L of peripheral blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany).\nFor each allele, we took the 95% confidence interval. Allele frequencies were compared by the χ2 test. The frequencies of both the TLR4 -23Ile polymorphism and the combination 3S-23Ile genotype were compared between SLE patients and the control group using chi-square test.\nThe genotypes of 15 allele variants were detected in 250 subjects. The genotype distribution for the TLR4 -23Ile polymorphism, for the 24 genotypes, are shown in Table 1.\n* In bold are 3S-23Ile and 3D-Ile genotype frequencies that are significantly different between SLE patients and control individuals (p<0.05).\nThe two major genotype frequencies for the 24 allele variants were compared between the SLE patient group and the control population. The frequencies of the 3S-23Ile and 3D-Ile genotypes were significantly different between SLE patients and control individuals (p<0.05).\nThe distribution of the 24 genotypes among the 90 SLE patients and 368 healthy controls was tested for association with SLE. No significant difference was found between SLE patients and controls for any of the genotypes. The combined frequency of the 3S-23Ile and 3D-Ile genotypes showed an association with SLE. Compared to the control group which had a prevalence of 27.8% in the 3S-23Ile and 3D-Ile genotype, the 83.3% prevalence of this double genotype was significantly higher in the SLE patient group (p<0.05).\nTLR4, a member of the Toll-like receptor family, is a receptor that has been identified and localized to a chromosomal region (q27.3) of DNA containing three distinct genes that encode 7 transmembrane-spanning proteins. These different members of the TLR family recognize different pathogen, and TLR4, the most widely expressed TLR, recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharides.\nThe present study was conducted to determine the association of the TLR4 -23Ile polymorphism with SLE susceptibility in a Chinese cohort. The genotypes of 15 allele variants were detected in 250 subjects. This is the first study to evaluate the 23 basepair allele polymorphism of T", "label": "llama"}

The results obtained indicate that P.\nThe present study was conducted with the aim of isolating and characterizing of a plant lectin from the stem bark of Ficus pumila L. using different extraction methods with the purpose of evaluating the possibility of isolation of different fractions with different specificities. The results obtained in this work showed that a single band was observed on the nonreducing SDS-PAGE, with a molecular weight of about 42 kDa or higher, which was in accordance with the reported molecular weight. Furthermore, the identification of two isoenzymes, with different pI, was also found. The isoelectric points obtained for the two isoenzymes were 5. 77 and 7. 30, suggesting similar structural features. The characterization of the isolated lectin using specific inhibitors revealed that the compliant lectin behaved as a serine, not a threonine, receptor. In addition, the results of immunochemo- graphy analysis showed that the compliant lectin specifically bound to a variety of pathogenic cell walls and hemidesmus morsus.\nChromosome aberrations are one of the most frequently used genetic damage indicators. There is enough evidence to support that the biological effects of radiation on cells are often expressed at the genetic level. The studies of chromosome aberrations indicate the genetic effects of ionizing radiation and the biological effects of radio- genesis, such as the cell cycle kinetcs, and they can be used in the estimation of the radiation dose. The aim of this study was the experimental evaluation of the induction of chromosomal aberrations in the cells of the radioresistant mammalian somatic cell line 10T1/2 and the estimation of the mutagenic activity in the cultures of plant species Solanum melongena L. (potato) and Brassica juncea L. (Chinese Kale). The mutagenic activity of the plant parts and the inhibition of the chromosomal aberrations by several plant extracts were also determined. Solanum melongena L. The potato cultivar “Vita” was grown in the fields, cut by a machine and then washed. Chromosome preparations were obtained from the plants of the species Solanum melongena L.\nSucrose metabolism is important in the determination of dry matter yield, and its content is related to the efficiency of transpiration in crops. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the herbicide clethodim (1, 4-dichlorobenzene-1, 3-diazinanecarboxylic acid) treatment, pre- and post-emergence, on the sucrose-related parameters of sugarcane cv. Juan C. Arenas during the dry and rainy season in the area of Valle del Cauca, Colombia. The study included three treatments to evaluate the herbicide concentration: control; 28 day application at 2894 liters x ha-1; and 71 day application at 1450 liters x ha-1, using mechanical weeding. The treatments were applied at sowing and at 15 days after sowing. The herbicide treatment, at the rate of 1450 liters x ha-1, achieved complete herbicidal control at 65% and 26% in the dry and rainy, respectively. This treatment caused a significant increase (p < 0.05) in sucrose percentage (19.6 and 21.6.3% and 1.5 and 1.7%), starch (59.4 to 64.3 vs 56.6 to 60.9%) and fiber content (25.1 and 27.3 vs 21.7 to 22.6%), mainly during the dry season. In the rainy season, the herbicide treatment caused an increase of 7.6 and 6.3% in the sucrose (55.8 and 37.1 vs 51.6 and 38.6%), starch levels ( 53.4 vs 51.4%) and fiber content (27.3 vs 26.3%) in relation to the control", "label": "llama"}

During his reign the Stuarts were dethroned and the Glorious Revolution had been peacefully enacted. He was crowned King William III and Queen Mary II of England at Westminster Abbey, London, on 13th April 1689.\nThe new monarch took a keen interest in the rebuilding of Charing Cross Station, and it was one of the first stations to gain his support. The first Royal visit to the London Underground took place on 1st October 1955.\nIn 1957, the station’s former wooden signal box was restored and placed under the care of London Transport Museum. This became the world’s first underground museum – the current site at London Transport Museum Depot in Acton. Charing Cross Station is now the largest station on the network, with 52 platforms in operation.\nThe station is named after the Charing Cross, the spot where the former royal palace at Whitehall stood which is marked by the Trafalgar Square’s Nelson's Column. The crossing, and thus the station, is the site of the execution of the fourteen year old Lady Jane Grey, who became Queen of England for nine days in 1553.

{"text": "The company has published accounts for last year showing an operating deficit of £44.5 million, with an exceptional loss of £57.6 million. Revenue was up by 12% at £1.88 billion.\nPete Waterman, the founder and executive chairman of Sanctuary, says that it has now restructured to remove non-performing businesses, and will now focus its property businesses on commercial business park developments in central and eastern Europe.\nSanctuary Group’s operating deficit over the year rose from £7.7 million to £44.5 million, which included the exceptional costs.\nBut a small part of the exceptional loss of £57.6 million relates to accounting policies changes, with an insurance claim and a write-off of goodwill in the Sanctuary Developments business.\nInvestors and analysts do not expect there to be an interim dividend this year. The company now has net debt of £75.1m, at the end of March, down from £107.2 million in the previous year.\nThe company had previously said that it would take action to reduce net debt from £107.2 million last year to £35 million by 2016 and to £15 million within three years.\nIts development division had been hit because it was “underperforming”. This had now been addressed by the restructuring, and Waterman said that “Sanctuary Property can resume its planned acquisitions programme from next year onwards”.\nProperty development and management, including the development of commercial business and residential developments, amounted to £735.8 million, up from £690.0 million in the previous year.\nHowever, development property and land sales dropped from £186.7 million to £67.8 million, and commercial and residential sales by more than 50% to £82.0 million.\nThere were 159 completions during the year, less than in any of the previous five years - and 112 of these were residential homes in London.\nThe operating deficit on this development activity - excluding costs incurred in respect of the development of the 430-home Kingsmead development - was £118.0 million, up from £20.3 million in 2014 and £12.6 million in 2013.\nThere were 459 completions in 2015, the majority in the new Build to Rent rental brand Sanctuary Rural Living.\nMr Waterman said: “Sanctuary Group has restructured the business to be profitable and create value and the performance over the previous 12 months has shown the effect of the changes.\n“The board continues to assess the options and will make further significant changes to improve performance, which will involve changes to investment strategy.\n“Our focus on the development of commercial parks in central and eastern Europe, combined with the Sanctuary Rural Developments business which has now refocused on small-scale development to build its pipeline, forms the core of the restructure for the group.”\nMr Waterman, who used to own 25% of the company’s shares and left the board in February 2014 after falling out with two other directors, now owns 11%. He had argued that there had been “significant mismanagement” over the last ten years, while the other directors have denied this.\nThe board appointed an independent director as chairman two years ago, and appointed a new chief executive and a new finance director last year.", "label": "llama"}

Of the 69 workers, 65 have already been offered and accepted full time jobs and four, who are employed on an agency basis, are to be guaranteed agency working from when their employment ends.\nIt was agreed as part of the settlement that the American owners of the company do not want to retain any of the workforce, and that they do not intend to recruit new employees. As a result the unions recommended that the employees be guaranteed agency working for a six month period.\nA spokesman from the Welsh TUC said “Almost £2 millions worth of redundancy payments from 70 jobs may seem a lot of money but in this instance it was the best deal it was possible to achieve and one that has been approved by the workers”.\nI think that the £2 million value of redundancy payments may well still be in dispute.

{"text": "Most Platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the lateral and ventral view, with the dorsal (aboral) side elevated to form a tentacle ring, and the oral arms protruding anteriorly. Platyctenida live in burrows with a short, flat, blunt anterior end and the rest being curved.\nThe number of lateral plates in the cephalothorax and abdomen, as well as the number of oral plates on the first arm (2 or 4; 5–7 if the abdomen has a parapod) are used as diagnostic characters. The lateral plates on the thorax and abdomen of males are usually larger than those of females.\nPlatyctenida are predatory. In the absence of prey, they can also be parasitised by paranerine worms.\nMembers of the group are generally common in muddy habitats on the soft sediment. Their behaviour is usually subterranean (burrowing), but sometimes they can be found near the surface. Their burrows provide refuge from predators and also give way to their food resources. When threatened, they retreat back to their burrows and quickly close off the way out. The burrow structure is similar to other mud burrow-dwelling species, and is aided by the mucus secreted from the joint. This mucus may also help to attract predators in the absence of prey.\nIn addition to the mucus, water trapped in air spaces at the joints may play an important role in osmoregulation. For example, Platyctenus ceylanicus has three layers of mucus and air trapped between them, providing a highly permeable barrier in its burrow.\nThere are a few examples of burrow sharing, such as the case where two females of the same species buried themselves in the same hole to get a better chance of attracting males and avoiding the territorial behaviour of males. Also, there have been cases of two species of Platyactenus burrowing together in one hole but each species living in a separate chamber. A rare example that has been recorded is that of a Platyactenus living in a burrow shared by another burrowing worm species.\nPaleoecology[edit]\nThis group seems to be of Late Jurassic age, when they appear as a very diverse group. The group is more diverse in the Late Jurassic, possibly due to the emergence of new marine groups at that time. During the Cretaceous period, the group became more specialised, and underwent reproductive isolation, losing their ability to cross-pollinate with closely related species. The group declined during the Cenozoic, possibly due to the invasion of freshwater environments by land-dwelling arthropods.\nSubfamilies and genera[edit]\nThe following subfamilies are recognised[1]:\nEuplatyctenidae Oliveira, 1979\nEuplatycteninae Oliveira, 1979, type genus Euplatyctenus Rathbun, 1898\nPhaetoporinae Delle Chiaje, 1828\nPhaetopusinae Delle Chiaje, 1829\nPlatyacteninae Humes, 1873\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-3.0 text from the reference[1]\n^ a b c d e f Dussart, P. 2009. \"Phylogenetic placement of Platyctenida (Lophophorata, Mollusca) and related problematic taxa: Revisiting the origin of the burrowing bivalves.\" In: Arnaud, B. and A.

{"text": "The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of a slide valve to control steam flow to the piston. To this end, the cylinder needed to seal against the block to prevent leakage. The piston rod now worked both the slide valve and the crank, and was double wrapped with leather to prevent sticking and wore at the point where the valve connected. The cylinder was now much higher than the block, and steam passed from the rear of the cylinder. This was called a ‘Babbington’ engine that allowed a low-pressure, continuous rotor to be attached to the crank, the piston itself now becoming a high-pressure rotor, working inside the cylinder. The rotor shaft ran longitudinally through the block instead of perpendicular to it. These engines were a giant leap forward in power output. This was the first realistic model for an engine for steamships as it allowed a high-pressure engine to be mounted below the main deck allowing it to drive an even larger paddle wheel which could push the ship through the water. There was no room for the engine to be within a paddlewheel case, as the paddlewheel would be mounted in the case. It was therefore necessary to build the wheel entirely out of metal, which considerably lightened its weight, but this also made it more brittle, and prone to fatigue.\nThe use of the slide valve was first used in 1809 by engineer John Cruikshank in a design to replace his existing rotative engine system on the ship HMS Hecla. However, the new design failed, the engines developing boiler and cylinder problems. This was not the end of his design though, but it was several years before he would succeed again and be ready to start producing a steamship to sell. In 1816 the HM 63, which also came to be known as the Sappho, was launched, the first vessel of its kind constructed to carry both cargo and passengers. Her propul-sion system had been designed by William Symington. This was the first successful rotary engined steam vessel, but still had severe problems with vibration in the bearings, and these were the source of constant breakdowns. The ship was a failure commercially and so there were now two types of ship, paddle steamer and steam sailing ship to the pre–war stage.", "label": "llama"}

That's how much I love you! And more so because you are my only love! I have not been sleeping and I have not had any food today. I have not been so busy since the time when my father got so sick and the doctor said he only had hours to live. So I slept only a few hours all that night.\nI was up all afternoon and most of the night too.\nI was up all night because you were my priority and my father was sick and the nurses had to call my mother in every hour and every minute because he was so close to the veil.\nI have not slept in two days.\nLast night I kept waking up because I had the memory I could not forget. I woke up and I kept looking to your room to see if you were there. And then I saw your light on and I went to you and then when I saw how I was, seeing you like that, seeing you sleeping as if you had no worries, I did not know what to do. I did not know what to think. I thought if it were the last time I ever saw you, I would not go back to the hospital to see him.\nI still loved him; if I couldn't see him then, how would I ever?\nBut seeing you so peaceful, so calm, my heart jumping around my chest in anxiety and then leaping for pleasure—if it were the last time I would have you, the last time I would hold you, could kiss you, be with you, that is what I would do. And this morning with all of us awake and with no time to waste, I am making that last time I might do something like that with you.\nI'm going to do it!\nI'm right here!\nI am not going to do it now!\nI am not going to do it now.

I will type it all up, how we went to the hospital, and how I saw you and came, and how I made you promise to only ever see me here and to promise to stay here with me in the woods, on our land, and when we leave you will be driving. You won't be riding in the back. When you get on then I will take you by your hand and we will go on. We'll drive back to the hospital with the radio on. You will play me songs we like but at first you will just have to listen and I will know what you are listening to by how your face lights up.\nI hope by then that your face will be so full of light you will even have a few light spots on your chin.

{"text": "background : bleeding is a major complication in contemporary gynecological surgery and carries a high cost to health-care systems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and to identify predictive variables for PPH.\nMethods: This was a prospective, open-labeled, randomized study carried out in three tertiary care hospitals. The study enrolled women undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. They were randomized to groups TXA plus (TXA+) or placebo. The primary outcomes were the rates of postpartum hemorrhage defined as blood loss > 1000 (1000–2000)mL and >500 (500–2000) mL, respectively.\nResults: A total of 289 women were randomized to TXA+ and 290 women to placebo. The demographic profile (mean age and weight) of both groups was comparable. The baseline hemoglobin was 9.2 g/dL in the TXA+ group and 9.3g/dL in the placebo group. Overall PPH was 32.3%, 22.1% for TXA+ and 50.5% for placebo; and the rate of total blood transfusion was 31.8% in TXA+ and 66.7% in placebo group. The use of tranexamic acid was found to significantly reduce total blood transfusion and postpartum hemorrhage by 40.9% and 29.5%, respectively in the TXA+ group. Age ≥30 years, and increasing number of previous pregnancies had no effect on reducing PPH. In contrast, mean maternal preeclampsia or PIH, baseline hemoglobin (<9.7g/dL) along with increasing preoperative hemoglobin were associated with PPH in both groups.\nConclusions: Our results are significant as they establish TXA+ as a safe, simple, easy to administer, and cost-effective intervention to prevent PPH after cesarean delivery. TXA could substantially reduce the occurrence and severity of postoperative bleeding and could save costs and improve outcomes in women undergoing cesarean section.", "label": "llama"}

Nintendo has since changed its tune somewhat by issuing \"amiibo Surfing\" mini-game demos, which are playable via the Nintendo 3DS system and the Wii U game system, with the objective of generating more interest.\nNintendo released three new Amiibo-based NFC-enabled Nintendo 3DS bundle packs on November 27th. As reported by Wii-Play-Zone, a special edition version of The Legend of Zelda 3DS bundle has also gone on sale in Japan, priced at 19,800 yen. That's roughly $175 at the time of this writing.\nThis new package includes a limited edition silver, The Legend of Zelda-themed body, a copy of the game, and several in-game bonus items, including the Master Sword, Princess Garnet and the Royal Tiara, and the Hylian Shield.\nThe new bundle is available now; it appears to be sold out on the Miyuki Shop website. Amazon Japan has yet to announce a release date for the special edition, which is available for pre-order for a \"19 February 2015 - 25 February 2015\" release window.\nNot exactly sure how the NFC bundles are going to help the demand for amiibo considering that they are more of an inconvenience, a pain in the wallet and a waste of money than anything that's going to help. And then there's all the amiibo themselves that don't do much.\nFor anyone who doesn't want to risk the luck of the dip with amiibo purchases, I would recommend just buying the bundles with a physical copy of the game in them if they are available.\nI'd advise against pre-ordering the Amazon Jpn ones since sometimes, the release date gets pushed back or moved up, and the date may not be accurate, but the other pre-orders I've seen so far are pretty good on quality and prices.\nAlso, amiibo, the NFC chips are used for the data transfer between them and the NFC compatible games, but the games themselves won't take up more storage since it can be transferred to the game's special data area after the amiibo/NFC chips are loaded with the relevant data.\nI'm surprised that more of the bundles aren't coming out with the games, or that they're being limited to a certain Nintendo 3DS system.\nStill, I do think that the bundles are likely going to help with the demand for the physical amiibo. I'm sure the bundles are going to move out fairly fast, but I don't think that they'll have much of an effect with the online sales in terms of easing supply issues.\nIt's just nice to finally have amiibo that fit the character aesthetic. And now that I've seen them all come out, I can rest easier knowing I've got a full collection.\nWorth taking into consideration that the bundles include both physical copies as well as the DLC codes.", "label": "llama"}

Roday and Hill both did well early on, with Roday getting an 80 and Hill getting 84 points. Meanwhile, the comedy was a relative ratings darling for the Alphabet on Monday, hitting a 4.4 rating in households nationally (making it the night’s most-watched program, outside of NCIS). The network is pleased with the series’ momentum, including the 4/13 debut, which did a 2.8 rating in households.\nUPDATE, 7:48 PM: After an all-Hayden-Pritchard-Pataki-Hannah-Mann debut Monday, the two-hour episode of the CBS series drew 12.82 million viewers when you count in the streamed content, up a bit from the debut’s 12.47 million. What’s more, and this is a big deal, Tuesday’s 9 PM show got a 2.4 rating among adults 18-49, a rare break-out demo ratings performance for CBS drama on that night (though the 49-year-old series’ 2.0 rating holds up better than some of its rivals).\nRatings-wise, it got a 3 out of 5 in today’s early morning tweets, but the demo share got an 8 out of 10. It also is drawing a 6 and 7 in this online survey.

The two-hour telecast of the show that stars Dermot Mulroney and Augustus Prew aired from 8-10 PM, with a 10.1/14 in 18-49, 15.33 million viewers and an 8 rating/14 share among adults 25-54. It skewed 26-49 (15.6 rating), which means a more narrow audience of viewers over the key demo that is younger.\n“It was great to see that we were consistent with our demo premiere of last year, and we also were very consistent with our audiences and delivered an audience and demo-friendly episode,” said Kelly Kahl, CBS entertainment president.\nHe noted in some instances, including The Big Bang Theory, the show in their second season has done better in L+3, which measures streaming and DVRs. For Pure Genius, “It will depend on episode by episode,” he said. “But our belief is that our younger skew audience will grow over time.” The Big Bang Theory has now surpassed the 18 to 34-year-old demographic, which is a key demo for advertisers.\nTuesday is a night where CBS had two returning series, a new reality series Ransone (a cop show) and Pure Genius, so the network did add the 9 PM The Big Bang Theory special to its Tuesday lineup, with the show about to go down as one of the biggest in TV history. The TBBT special drew a 5.3 rating/19 share, 18.65 million viewers.\nThat series just got a renewal for a 12th and possibly penultimate season, while the premiere of Ransone did 7.3 million viewers and a 1.3 rating, and the hourlong show got a 1.4 demo. Pure Genius did not get a formal renewal, but Kahl said the show is close on that.\nAsked about whether the show would work as a Netlix series, he said, “We haven’t talked. But for now, it’s a first-run episode. I think the ratings did provide an indication that the show is working for us and it’s an entertaining show,” he said.\nAs for Ransone, CBS Entertainment president Glenn Geller said the series was inspired by an idea from star Gary Sinise, who also came up with the medical show (which takes inspiration from the actor’s work in the Illinois", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "Under the policy, cities will have to meet three conditions to qualify for federal help:\nBe willing to make land available.\nProtect private property rights.\nDevelop sound land-use controls.\nAs envisioned, however, such cities would not have to comply with the existing zoning ordinance, if it restricted densities and heights below those that will be permitted in the new zones, which will be adopted by the commission. In other words, a city such as Ponte Vedra would have to conform to Ponte Vedra's code.\nPonte Vedra, however, is in a different, more restrictive category, due to the fact it has developed much of the undeveloped tracts in a way not permitted by the city's comprehensive plan. City planners said this year that all of the city's land will have to be rezoned by 2005 to bring developments into line with the new zones, which will replace the 20-foot-wide-lot zoning currently in effect. One result of this process would be to force the elimination of some lots in Ponte Vedra now zoned as 36,365 and 36,303.\nIf zoning amendments proposed under the RPC program are approved, they would become part of Ponte Vedra's code.\nWhile the RPC program would not require Ponte Vedra property owners to tear down existing homes, it would force developers to build taller structures, in a city of low-rise developments. And it would result in Ponte Vedra developers having to pay more for lots.\nIf the commission adopts Ponte Vedra's RPC ordinance it would become part of the city's code, making the city more attractive to the RPC program than other Northeast Florida cities, but some Ponte Vedra leaders and officials fear it could also open the door for a state-regulated or even state-regulated and supervised form of RPC to be forced on them.\nNorth Florida cities, including Ponte Vedra, are not required by the state to have a comprehensive plan, but are encouraged to adopt them. Most have plans adopted under Florida Statute requirements, which would mean those plans would have to be revised by 2005 and 2008 under state law.\nPonte Vedra's comprehensive plan was created in 1990 but readopted in 1997 after being found by the Florida Department of Community Affairs not to be consistent with state laws.\nCity leaders fear the state commission's RPC program would make Ponte Vedra vulnerable to state control of local land-use regulations and planning.\n\"There's a real sense within the community of `here we go again,' \" said Bill Muckel, chairman of the Northeast Florida Legislative Delegation. \"The last time we saw something like where we're ending up now  20-foot-wide lots are about to become a thing of the past  there was a lot of resistance to rezoning everything from 30-foot lots to 36-, 37- and even higher on the back of residential property.\n\"That was when the last comprehensive plan was adopted. This is going to be a very challenging thing. If you're not going to go to the (Mason) Plan, you're going to run into the same kind of situation. This is going to be a big deal. Some of us (in Tallahassee) are reluctant to be a part of that process. If a decision is going to be forced on the city, we're going to find that very unsettling.\"\nCAN'T HURT TO SUBMIT THE PLAN\nWhile the city has not adopted an official position on RPC, some city officials have indicated that it, like Adena, believes that the time would not be ill-spent to make a submission because it makes Northeast Florida appear more welcoming to new private investment, economic development and job creation. It could also give Ponte Vedra a chance to get a foot in the door for RPC. City officials said a submission to the JCC would make it easier to get on RPC's radar screen in hopes of making it onto the list of select communities.\nCity officials have indicated a belief that the city's RPC-type plan is superior to any plan proposed by the Urban Land Institute, the private consultants' group.\n\"In my opinion, what we put forward already is superior to the Urban Land Plan in terms of our", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "uncertainty around the value of and appropriate regulatory models for the new technologies and firms.\n• The industry is very competitive, with players vying for differentiation strategies based on product features or service characteristics. Product features in the short term are typically the most visible source of competitive advantage. However, the development of sustainable competitive advantage (which is achieved by offering reliable products with high quality standards, and by efficiently managing the value chain) requires a longer investment horizon.\n• In addition, the market for new energy technologies is still evolving. Increasing investment in the market (especially by large corporations in new fields such as energy storage, electric vehicles, solar and wind systems) has resulted in a shift toward an increasingly mature market.\n• The industry is regulated. Public policy seeks to ensure that a market for new energy is created and functions efficiently, providing the necessary incentives for long-term investment, particularly in R&D. Regulatory developments are at times disruptive, with significant impact on the industry’s strategy and competitive advantage. This has not prevented competition for technological leadership or market share.\nAs an example of how the industry is regulated, in order to incentivize R&D the Brazilian government has, since the opening of the energy market, introduced various instruments such as specific research areas, research and development subsidies and technology investment tax credits for energy. Although the industry is becoming less regulated now, large investments remain to be made in order for the industry to become more efficient through the use of new technologies and the deployment of the best available technology.\nAs with other types of energy, there is a high level of uncertainty and the potential for market evolution with the introduction of new technologies, but there is also a lack of market definition and appropriate regulation on certain segments of the energy market.\nThis scenario has a high level of uncertainty, as there are several new products that are only at early stages in the market lifecycle. The Brazilian energy market has seen the entry of new types of providers of electric energy, such as IPPs, which are developing large renewable projects, with some of them becoming market players and entering traditional lines of business. Although in the short term new-to-the-sector providers of traditional electric energy are likely to focus on their mainstay businesses, it is expected that some of them will become active in the market in the medium term. The emergence of new categories of energy producers with their own business strategies that can compete with traditional players will alter the business strategies of traditional players.\n• The electricity and energy market is being regulated on the basis of the principle of competitive supply to consumers and on the basis of transparency on operating conditions (for example, energy prices) and on regulatory accounting principles applied to tariff calculation. These principles will change in response to new technologies, which could lead to further changes in rules of competition and regulation.\n• Another key factor determining the industry’s evolution is technology. As new technologies become available they could introduce innovation and competition (for example, in generation and transmission) and change traditional business models. Thus, the use of new technologies requires a high investment commitment by incumbent providers to maintain and enhance its competitive advantage in the market and the development of innovative products and services that give it a competitive advantage.\n• As indicated in the previous section, there is a lack of clear definition of the Brazilian electricity market, which makes the definition of a business model difficult for large integrated incumbents (which are at risk of losing their competitive advantage over time).\n• Other important factors are the increasing cost of carbon emissions and the environmental legislation and energy efficiency regulation. The new regulatory framework for environmental liabilities (a new rule on contaminated sites in the electricity, gas and petroleum sectors) was adopted by the Brazilian government in September 2016 and entered into force on December 14, 2016. A number of electricity and oil and gas and gas generation and transmission companies will need to make provisions regarding possible contaminated sites, which will generate uncertainty as to the extent of future liabilities and will complicate the company’s long-term planning.\nEnergy service providers are increasingly active in Brazil’s electricity and energy market. Energy service providers use a range of activities aimed to help customers improve energy efficiency in order to reduce energy consumption and costs. This includes consulting services, which help companies manage their energy consumption, such as by adjusting lighting levels, refrigerator temperatures and temperature levels of servers. This is a typical example of a business model for an", "label": "llama"}

One morning, one of the most important people in the family's life dies, and Swift Message suffers a heart attack. This event sends the whole family into chaos and his life into ruin. He suffers anguish from his painful situation, and the family suffers as well because when there is pain in the family it is everyone who suffers. After a few months of suffering this pain, the father makes an appointment with Swift Message's doctor and takes him to the psychiatrist's office, and asks the doctor to help him and his family. The doctor's name is Tecnario, a well informed and wise man who has a special skill in finding the emotional and mental strength that is missing in each person. Since Swift Message's father brought his son to him, Tecnario knows that they do not need to waste time and so, as soon as they have entered the office, he asks Swift Message to tell him the worst thing that happened, and to tell him his history, his childhood, and his adulthood. After a few minutes he hears Swift Message say that this was the worst thing that could happen to him in his life and ask him to tell what happened to him in his childhood. Tecnario gives him a sign to go ahead.\nIn a little more than twenty minutes Tecnario hears Swift Message say that his childhood was good because he had a good relationship with a good family, including the house mother, the brothers and the sisters. He says that the house mother was a woman of forty-two years, that is, twelve years younger than his father. She was beautiful, very intelligent, and a woman with many charms. They used to call her La Cachipaya because they said she was very good at making and preparing cachibacha (boza sweet drink). At that time boza was very popular, especially among high school students. He says that she was very good with all the children because they all liked her, and that La Cachipaya (Sweet Mother) was an affectionate woman who they would go to bed kissing each one and telling good-night. They, in turn, when they were good she also kissed them good-night, or so their parents believed.\nHe explains that not everyone was as good as his parents believed and that he had an older sister in her twenties. He recalls that his eldest brother was ten years older than he was and that his sister was sixteen, so his age was twenty-four years old. The eldest brother, he says, was the favorite of La Cachipaya, so he wanted to be a doctor, but as time goes by he found out that he had to study a lot to get into the university, and he found that because he had to move to the capital, he would find it difficult to continue his studies. He explains that he was the only brother in the family with whom that woman was uncomfortable and, because he never understood the reason for being so, he found it easier to leave the family, and as a result, his mother suffered more. And that was after graduating from high school which his father, with great effort, was able to pay for him. He explained that the family did not have as much as they got from his brother, so since then they have had to go through many situations, so his mother started suffering even more and one day, suddenly, she died. He remembers what happened that day.\nThat day he came home and saw his father very sad. He sat on the sofa, and he put his left hand, his most visible one, on his shoulder, and he started to cry, so he went to see what was wrong, and his father explained that his mother had died and that they would be buried the next day. He was young and did not understand the death of the mother, what it meant at that time, what she has since been saying, what she is, is, and will be doing. He says when he was a child he did not cry if it was not because he played, that's it. I liked to play very much in those days and he would leave the house to play all the time and always returned safely without hurting himself. He says that he was a good boy, because even then he did not steal and he did not disturb.\nSwift Message says that as he grew older, his sister became a woman like this in the afternoon and that was a person who went out every day, did not sleep and would come in at dawn.

{"text": "a 37-year - old male presented with fever and jaundice. Liver biopsy from patient’s liver revealed marked fibroinflammatory activity and sinusoidal occluding inflammatory cell infiltrate. The patient gave history of anti-TNF alpha therapy, but the liver biopsy was taken when he was afebrile. There was no clinical suspicion of acute hepatitis.\nWhat causes inflammatory hepatitis following TNF alpha blocker treatment?\nIf TNF alpha is critical for immunomodulation of liver fibrosis then blocking it might increase liver fibrosis. So, it was initially hypothesised that anti TNF alpha agents might accelerate liver fibrosis.\nHowever, on further evaluation, the TNF alpha blocking drugs are not associated with liver fibrosis acceleratioin.\nThe other proposed mechanism relates to the generation of antibodies (immunoglobulin G) specific to the TNF alpha blocking agent, the degradation of which might lead to the development of hepatic inflammatory reaction.\nHarmouni et al. in their study found that TNF alpha blocking agents may be associated with the development of autoimmune hepatitis, but were not associated with either sinusoidal inflammatory reaction or fibrosis.\nWhat kind of cell reactions in liver may mimic the inflammatory hepatitis?\nIt has been found that TNF alpha blocker drugs could lead to sinusoidal and portal inflammation in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis.\nThe pattern of portal inflammation appears to simulate inflammatory hepatitis (sinusoidal and hepatocyte inflammation along with portal inflammation).\nDrugs known to cause sinusoidal and portal inflammation are TNF or IFN blocking agents.\nWhat do you think is responsible for the occurrence of sinusoidal portal inflammation in anti TNF alpha drugs. What might be the mechanism? Which histological pattern would be expected?\nClinically, the patients on anti TNF alpha drugs may present with an acute elevation of serum transaminases, often with concomitant jaundice.\nThe portal inflammation mimics that of acute hepatic viral infections.\nHistologically, the liver will show portal inflammation as in parainfluenza infection i.e. hepatocyte inflammation, hepatic sinusoidal inflammation along with portal inflammation, which may lead to liver transplant.\nWhat do you think is responsible for the development of anti-TNF alpha antibodies?\nThe mechanism of the development of antibodies is not clear. The hypothesis is that the drug molecules have a similar structure to that of native TNF alpha. The liver macrophages and other antigen presentating cells phagocytize the drug- TNF alpha molecules and present these to T cells of the immunological system (CD4+ or CD8+ T cells).\nMacrophages and monocytes, as CD40+ cells, are primary recipients of TNF alpha molecules, which leads to phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the TNF alpha molecules. There is a hypothesis that the T cells react against these anti-TNF alpha agents, which degraded molecules of TNF alpha (different from that of native TNF alpha). This may precipitate the occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis.\nThere is a possibility that these antibodies are responsible for the histological features observed on liver biopsy.\nIf there is a possibility that these antibodies are important in developing a patient’s immune response, may liver biopsy be avoided before starting anti-TNF alpha drug therapy?\nIn light of the data, can the antiparasitic agent, pyrantel pamoate be recommended for use in patients on anti-TNF alpha drug therapy?\nPyrantel pamoate belongs to the group of nematode-specific antischistosomal therapy. It is also active against larval and adult of filarial worms.\nIn 2017, Dahmani et al. conducted a study to evaluate the safety of pyrantel pamoate in patients undergoing treatment with TNF alpha blocking agents.\nThe investigators found the use of pyrantel pamoate in patients receiving anti-TNF alpha agents (adalimumab", "label": "llama"}

Mechanical measurements are used in laparoscopy to assess the degree of instrument insertion and to judge whether it is necessary to reposition the instrument in the field of vision. The objective of our study was to investigate the accuracy of the instrument measurement in a range of LESS Single-Channel Instrumentation Technology (LESS Single-Channel Instrumentation Technology instruments. This system consists of a fixed camera, a robotic system that moves the pendulum and two other endoscopic arms to allow the operator to perform minimally invasive surgical tasks. We also aimed to find a set of mechanical measurements that can be reliably repeated and easily applied by the user.Methods: We used an experimental rig with three arms to replicate mechanical measurements (the length of the inserted instrument, the angle the wrist is held at relative to the body and the distance the instrument tip is from the fixed point). We tested the accuracy of each measurement system during the insertion and retraction of the instrument (n = 10 for each). To verify the reliability of our measurements, we also tested the same instrument with the same measurement system (n = 10 for each) for different angles of manipulation. Results: During retraction with the instrument in the abdominal cavity, the distance between the wrist pivot and the probe tip was the most reliable method (reliability coefficient R = 0.964, p\n0.000). The length of the inserted instrument was the least reliable. Manipulating the instrument through a greater angle of rotation was also associated with greater unreliability with the length of instrument and the wrist position. During insertion, the length of the inserted instrument and the angle of the wrist position were not reliable, and the relationship between distance from the fixed point and the length of inserted instrument did not conform to the linear relationship as suggested by the theoretical model (R = 0.347, p < 0.000).Conclusion: None of the three mechanical measurements were reliable to measure the distance between the instrument tip and the fixed point, length of the instrument or the rotation of the wrist to a fixed point. The distance between the instrument tip and the fixed point was reliably measured (R = 0.964). However, future studies should still perform validation testing to determine the clinical utility of these measurements. Intra- and interoperator variability should also be measured through prospective studies.\nkeywords : Surgical Instrument, Laparoscopy, Single Incision\ndoi : 10.1089/bjp.2010.131", "label": "llama"}

A single serum calcium level was compared with 14-month serial values in the subjects. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) concentrations were measured as part of a general screen for infectious and metabolic causes of hypercalcemia. In the 14 months of follow-up only 3 of the 22 hypercalcemic subjects (13.6% of patients with hypercalcemia) had normal serum calcium levels. In these 3 subjects, changes in serum calcium levels correlated more closely with concurrent changes in CRP (r = 0.4761; P < 0.001), CNP (r = 0.2775; P < 0.05) and creatinine (r = -0.2481; P < 0.05), than in subjects with hypercalcemia. CNP correlated negatively with serum free and total 25(OH)D3, whereas CRP and C-peptide correlated positively with these values.

The current study was conducted to estimate the incidence and prevalence of CKD requiring initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) including peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. A retrospective cohort consisting of 147,135 patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy was constructed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database between 2000 and 2011. The incidence density of CKD requiring initiation of RRT was estimated by Poisson regression taking age, race, sex, geographic region, comorbidity scores, and cancer diagnosis as covariates. The cohort was followed until January 2014. During the observation period, 2096 (1.42%) patients developed CKD requiring initiation of RRT of which 1276 (59.6%) patients had HD and 820 (39.2%) patients had PD. The incidence density of CKD requiring initiation of RRT was 17.9 per 100,000 person-years (PY). Incidence of CKD requiring initiation of RRT varied by age, race, sex, cancer diagnosis, and geographic region. Incidence was lower in females (20.9/100,000 PY) than in males (38.5/100,000 PY) [P<0.0001] and in non-Hispanic whites (41.0/100,000 PY) than in non-Hispanic blacks (18.5/100,000 PY) and all other races [P <0.0001]. The incidence density of CKD requiring initiation of RRT was lowest in patients with lung, skin, and breast cancer, as well as in those receiving taxanes and platinum agents for cancer. The incidence density of CKD requiring initiation of RRT requiring PD was twice that of HD, while the cumulative incidence of CKD requiring initiation of RRT requiring PD was lower in the younger patient subgroup (44.6%) than in the elderly patient subgroup (65.2%).

{"text": "A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between themselves and their wives at marriage. A lot of the responses are really touching but one standout commentary came from our Editor Peter Cochrane.\nPeter says: “I was 77 when I married my wife 25 years ago. We were both widowed and both had a daughter who is now 45. Our first daughter and her husband came to the wedding of mum and I. My wife is 83. Our other daughter and her husband joined us for our 50th wedding anniversary last year.”\nI wonder if I’ll get this right because this is a good question and I want to write something really good in reply! I also really want to get it right because I think there is something really interesting about a number of the contributors who are talking about how very much they have in common.\nPeter and Helen Cochrane live on the same street and their kids live a couple of doors up the street from one another. Helen was widowed as well, and so I can guarantee that Peter will help Helen to stay ‘grounded’. I’m sure they will make a lovely blend.\nDorothy is only 18 months younger than her beloved Jack, but she says that having the three of them married and living around the corner from Peter and Helen Cochrane will make them a wonderful ‘foursome’. And I bet that’s right, because as we know it is often two halves that make a whole.\nNancy and I did a bit of ‘catching up’ over the weekend and I mentioned that as some of us are getting married I would like to write about the age difference at weddings. After I married my second wife, who was the same age as me, I started to notice that people would ask me how many years older or younger my wife was.\nAnd when my second wife became ill I was often asked why I had stayed with someone who was so much older. So I started writing down what I could remember about conversations I’d had and the responses I’d had to that question.\nFirstly, my second wife’s brother told me I should have married someone younger as I would have more in common with her in the ‘present’ and have less in common with her in the ‘future’. But I asked him to be careful because if we have children and they are married with kids when they are 35 years old, I would still have more in common with their children than I would have with them!\nMy husband died when he was only 53, and his age was very different to my age when he died. I guess it is easy for people to say they would have stayed with a partner if theirs died and then went on to start a whole new relationship. But if your partner is taken from you, when you have not taken responsibility for ending the partnership, how do you know what you would or wouldn’t do. You don’t have any idea really?\nI have always been an advocate of going ‘with your feelings’ because people are either comfortable or they’re not and they know it. If you go with your feelings you will not go with the fear of what people will think.\nAnd I always say that if you were to go a whole life without living with someone that it would take you most of that life for you to really feel the loss properly and then have time, space and energy to be able to move on.\nIt may just be that I am a woman who has been let go by a spouse? Maybe I am just a little selfish in thinking that I should get to choose who I marry or if I marry again? Maybe? But also I say that it is about personal identity rather than age and sometimes getting married to someone younger is to give someone else an identity when you might already have a good one.\nIn my personal opinion it is also easier for a woman to lose connection with her body when she’s had children.\nI was only 40 when my second husband died and I had had two children, so I think when I was ready to make it clear that I was a free woman I chose to start dating a man who was even younger than my husband was when he died. I also think that when we don’t take out our anger on people we love when we feel rejected there is more energy to go further out into the world.\nWhen we meet someone new, it feels like they are new and we don’t have any preconceived ideas, ideas that have been shaped by previous relationships, ideas of what we are looking for. We have space and time to think about ourselves as an equal partner and how much we have in common as individuals rather than as partners.\nThe reason I have", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "Andy Moll was part of a three-man team exploring a cave system in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas with two friends (Jason Balling, Troy Bradner). At about 9:30 a.m. Balling and Moll began the descent into the cave. Moll and Balling did the descent first: At 1,500 feet Balling began to have trouble with some equipment. At 1550 feet Moll had to abandon the descent because the route had completely flooded over. He then went back up to warn Balling. A little more than an hour later Balling had gotten through, he descended to Moll and had a change, and went back up. At about 1 p.m. Balling descended into the cave to meet with Moll and Bradner to go back up. On or just after his descent Balling found the two of them but only Moll was there. Bradner had fallen and injured his back.\nIn his book Andy reported to Balling and went up the shaft; he returned to Balling and Bradner and brought them up. He then spent the night in the cave and the following morning headlamps were found near the entrance. Later in one of his many interviews he said that in the morning they looked for Moll as they went up the shaft but did not find him. The final expedition of the year was the Christmas trip with Balling and Bradner. On that trip they found Moll's helmet at the top of the shaft where they had originally met.\nThe next day Balling climbed into the cave to rescue his friend from a 700-foot chamber with water up to his chest. They spent New Years Eve in the cave. On January 1, 1980 Balling discovered Moll's body about a third of a mile (520 m) away.\nOn January 4, 1980 Balling climbed the 150-foot shaft into the cave to retrieve Moll's body. The body was retrieved, and Balling climbed back up to meet those waiting at the surface.\nOn January 18, 1980 the sheriff faxed (it's not entirely clear what kind of fax machine this was) a fax to a New Mexico caver in which it was stated that they would not accept searchers into the cave. As it turned out, the \"sheriff\" (Joe Spurlock) was a caver and knew the area fairly well. He never had jurisdiction of the caves, but he was the \"law\" on the surface.\nThough the investigation was carried out by the local sheriff, due to the size and significance of the tragedy, it fell to Spencer County Sheriff David Anderson to organize it. Spurlock, who was a caver and knew the cave area well, was tasked with the job of supervising the search operation. Spurlock, who had worked under Anderson for 27 years, also became a critic of Anderson's leadership of the investigation. In a local paper, he stated that \"Anderson didn't know his ass from a hole in the ground … I tried to stop him from making this big goof.\" He also stated that Anderson \"had zero ability to direct anything other than pissin' contests.\"\nInvestigators from the National Park Service, Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the U.S. Army Special Operations Command came in from out of state.\nAnother criticism of the investigation is the speed with which it was discontinued.\nOn January 18, 1980 a letter was mailed to the National Speleological Society (NSS) to request help in identifying Andrew's body. The letter was signed by Joe Spurlock but it appears that the letter was drafted by someone else because at points it is inconsistent with the sheriff's characterization of events, and it may be that the NSS official who signed it was simply doing it in his capacity as an official with the NSS. The letter contained an invitation to the NSS to participate in the investigation, stating that \"The State of Arkansas is asking assistance in locating a missing cave explorer/student who was at or in the vicinity of the 700 foot shaft on January 1. The assistance from the Association's expertise will be greatly appreciated.\"\nAccording to the sheriff's letter, Andrew Moll had been found the previous day by his two friends and his body recovered by the same individuals who were with him the day he disappeared.

There may not have been sufficient technology available at the time to successfully apply the new concepts of sleek airframes and powerful inline engines to this type of aircraft. To get there without first going through the \"classic\" aircraft stage with power plants like radials, inline engines would have required a quantum leap in engineering to build and maintain.\nBut it was the A6M that first brought the Japanese to the fore of the Pacific War, and is still remembered as a legendary aircraft because of Japanese propaganda, it's legendary appearance (including the ability for a \"Zero\" to perform a \"suicide dive\"), it's use in Pearl Harbor, and in some countries, it's reputation as a killer of Allied pilots. But the true picture is rather different.\nIn fact, with the exception of the P-51 \"Mustang\", not a single Allied fighter in Europe or the Pacific was killed by a \"zero\". It was a fantastic aircraft capable of outperforming the British Spitfire and American P-38 Lightning and P-40 Warhawk, and had the longest production run and the highest number of total units ever produced by Japan. But it's reputation for being a formidable killer and a great fighter was greatly exaggerated, in fact, the British found that a few well aimed 20mm cannons would remove a \"zero\" in less than 10 seconds even when the Japanese pilot was taking evasive maneuvers to make himself a target. The same with the Germans in Europe. The P-51 mustang was killed by few \"Zeros\" even at low level where it was most suited, with the best pilots the Japanese had (such as Saburo Sakai of 202), the Japanese pilots had some issues that reduced their effectiveness vs P-51s. They had to fly into the sun and even if they shot down the P-51 pilot, they often forgot to do the 180 degree turn, leaving themselves and their comrades sitting ducks.\nThe P-40 (which had been rushed into production long before being properly field-tested) simply didn't stand much chance against skilled A6M pilots during the early part of the Pacific War, and the Japanese found the.50 caliber armament ineffective at altitude and also inaccurate at long range and unreliable in general, the pilot was simply too far from the gun to aim effectively.\nThe Japanese only had a few hundred A6Ms in service in 1941 and almost all were in China where they had limited success. When they were in contact with American carriers, the Japanese found themselves hopelessly outmatched, and although a few Zeroes did shoot down aircraft, the vast majority were lost in combat through outmoded engines making aircraft vulnerable to newer fire control systems, a very lackluster performance at altitude compared to the P-51, and the \"zero\" was no longer able to dominate the sky as before. The P-51 was superior to the \"zero\" in almost every way. It was faster, had longer range, fired better guns, and it's fighter had greater fire control systems, a higher top speed and much greater maneuverability. The \"zero\" lacked an effective radar, and it's two engines made it difficult to land on the carrier.\nThe first \"zero\" variant which was actually able to contend with Spitfires was the A6M3. But the most important breakthrough in Japanese fighter design had come in November 1942 with the replacement of the Type 91 engine by the two-speed Hitachi Kinshi (1500 h", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "Environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result in the short run from the spill, and long run form the oil industry and its products. They fear this event to trigger global climate change and also to result in the destruction of other ecosystems on the planet.\nHowever, environmentalists have a very particular point of view when they analyze events as major as this one. There is nothing wrong with disagreeing. For example, I recently posted here that I do not believe environmentalists understand how our societies will recover from this crisis. But, then again, perhaps my post, “Deepwater’s impact on society – part 1000 – we are now an oil dependent society,” would not have as many hits had I not put “deepwater” in the title at the beginning.\nAnyway, the environmentalists do see a long term biodiversity loss that is going to result from this event. They worry about the ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico and especially the oil spill’s impact on the oil rigs. So, the environmentalists do have a point, but I believe that even this point is partially wrong as well.\nLet me elaborate the reasons why this is the case. When something catastrophic happens that can cause harm for a large proportion of the species of a local ecosystem and thus a local environment, it is usually considered a disaster of large magnitude. In this case, most environmentalists agree that the disaster has been caused precisely by the destruction of marine life, since that is what we know the most about. Since, even if that is true, we do not know that this will happen, I find the reasoning questionable. The fact is that what we have seen from the beginning has that potential but we do not know if it will happen.\nAnother reason that environmentalists may be concerned about the possibility that ecosystems that were once considered pristine and untouched by humans be invaded by other species is that what we now know as a pristine environment was once invaded but we cannot notice it since we did not know about that invader at the time. A classic example is the case on evolution of species, which has been invaded and disrupted by the homo sapiens, but the process was so gradual as to be imperceptible when people only made use of natural resources and did not begin to change and impact the ecosystem.\nThe fact of the matter is that we should always be concerned and make sure that this will be a disaster of global magnitude. However, there are no guarantees. There is plenty of room for debate. If I were an environmentalist, I would be concerned about species that are already endangered by the onslaught of global climate change, and in particular about the possibility of overpopulation destroying many species or at least affecting them to a point at which their disappearance takes centuries, as it did recently in China.\nWhen I was asked whether I think about the future of our planet and society, I said “yes. “ The key point is whether there is something we can do about it. For example, when we have disasters such as the one we have now or a disaster such as the one that happened 20 years ago in Mexico. We think about how we can better equip ourselves to handle such events so that we can avoid them or minimize the damage and the negative impacts they cause. The key for all of us to better prepare ourselves for dealing with these disasters is through education. I consider myself a teacher of risk and risk management, and this is why I am writing here on this blog and have other initiatives. We can never really have an end in our efforts to make sure that we never have to suffer disasters of this magnitude. We can only try to make ourselves better prepared whenever a disaster can possibly happen.\nThis entry was posted on May 4, 2010 at 11:34 pm\tand is filed under Disasters, Economics, Education, Environmental, Risk Management.

The Rhine's sources are the Thur, the Reuss, the Aar, the Birs, the Oberrhein and the Vorderrhein.\nIn the past, the Rhine was used as a transport route for wine, wood, mineral ore, and slaves. This usage has significantly declined in favor of shipping via the river's dams, such as those in Remagen, Koblenz and Bonn, that were built in the 20th century for economic purposes (still for exporting). Other reasons for economic purposes is to provide a water supply for large cities. Other dams are planned, but environmentalists want them to be built as weirs to preserve the river's ecology.\nThe Rhine flows mainly in a northerly direction with two notable exceptions. Between Bingen am Rhein and Bonn the river, instead of heading north, stretches in an easterly direction. Between Basel and Rotweil, the Rhine turns sharply to the south and forms the border between Switzerland and Germany. Near Basel the river and its tributary streams have cut through the Swiss Jura and the French Vosges.\nThere are about 2 million inhabitants living along the banks of the Rhine in Germany, of whom 2.6 % live in the central Rhine Valley (between the confluences of Ruhr and Neckar). About 8 million people live on the Rhine in Switzerland of whom 5.6 % live on the left shores. On the left riverbanks of France live 9.6 % of the 13.7 million people on the Rhine. In the western part of Germany about 57%, Switzerland about 64% and France about 80% of the population live on the banks of the Rhine.\nOn the upper Rhine the river flows between the Vosges mountains with their gorges, and the Rhenish Slate Mountains, with numerous gorges. The lower Rhine is bordered by the Lower Rhine Hills and the Dutch Plateau. In the middle and lower Rhine, the surrounding uplands rise in steep slopes.\nFurther information: List of tributaries of the River Rhine\nThe major tributaries of the Rhine include: the Rhône, the Main, Danube, Neckar, Warta and the Rego. The Rhine is also connected to Lago Maggiore and Lago di Como, by canals, and to Lake Constance.\nThe Rhine was traditionally divided in two by an oxbow lake formed by a meander of the river. Nowadays, this is the Rhine-Lake.\nFurther information: List of cities along the Rhine\nThe Rhine enters several countries:\nThe Rhine is navigable from the North Sea and the Black Sea.\nAs the Rhine and its valleys were the gateway to the Empire for long, many castles were built across its valleys.\nThe Rhine is not only important for tourism and transport, but also for many other indust", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "we present a method for fast optimal estimation of the inversion error. The problem is solved by means of a simple iterative scheme on the basis of matrix eigenvalue analysis. A number of special solutions is applied in all important cases of the problem. In practice, two problems associated with the inversion procedure of gravity surveys are most critical. The first of these problems is incurred in situations when the value of the true gravity anomaly is much less than unity; the second is typical when the value of the inversion error becomes as small as a fraction of the minimum error. It is noted that on one hand the first problem is predominant, and on the other hand the second problem is a rarity. The inversion error and inversion error error can thus be conveniently expressed in the ratio of a few numbers of the order of several million and the fraction of the minimum error; the inversion error is thus of the order of thousands of multiplied by 0.1. For the inversion process on the basis of a complete elliptic regularization, two numerical tests are given; the first one assumes that the actual distribution of the error is known so the results of the regularized inversion of the original data are compared with those of the regularized inversion of the processed data. Results of two numerical tests of the latter type are presented and discussed.\nDmitriev, O. S. (1956), An Analysis of the Dip-Angle Distribution in Gravity Exploration. Proc. I. G. U. R.

{"text": "topological quantum computation with fibonacci anyons relies on the possibility to realize a generalized version of the fidelity \\cite{C1999,E1999} of the ground state of anyons with respect to an initial state.\nEssentially, this operation, which is non trivial only if the system consists of different kinds of anyons, is based on a two-qubit unitary operator $U$ which connects initial state $| i (1) \\rangle \\otimes | i (2) \\rangle$ with final state:\n\\begin{equation}\n| i (1) \\rangle \\otimes | i (2) \\rangle \\rightarrow U | i (1) \\rangle \\otimes | i (2) \\rangle.\n\\end{equation}\nUsually the anyons considered in topological quantum computation are subject to local gauge invariance, which makes gauge degrees of freedom irrelevant. The existence of such a gauge invariant anyon system does not preclude the possibility of having a topological order and of implementing a quantum computation. Actually a non abelian topological order may consist of quasiparticles whose anyon charge does not commute with the gauge degrees of freedom \\cite{B2004}. Thus, in order to implement the operations mentioned above within the framework of topological quantum computation, it is necessary to distinguish the gauge phase degree of freedom from the rest of the Hilbert spaces.\n\nFortunately, this is possible in the fermionic and anyonic systems and we can use this distinction to implement a non-abelian topological state. A good example can be had from the fractional anyonic systems described in \\cite{Cirac2009}, where non-abelian topological states can be prepared from the fermionic models introduced in the same article.\n\nThe most significant differences between the gauge and the non-abelian topological phases are:\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[1. The gauge connection]\nThe gauge connection which implements the gauge degrees of freedom becomes insensitive for non-abelian topological phases.\n\\item[2. The topological charge]\nThe non abelian topological phases are characterised by a non-abelian topological charge (NATC) defined as\n\\begin{equation}\nk_i= 4 \\int d^2 r N_i(r)^2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $N_i$ denotes the holon operator of that anyonic species, see below. The integer $k_i$ is gauge invariant and, thus, measuring the NATC corresponds to unveiling the topological feature of the phase without involving gauge connections.\n\\item[3. Anyon statistics]\nIn anyonic phases with non-abelian topological charge $k_i$, the holons interact according to fermionic or bosonic statistics depending on the parity of $k_i$.\nFermionic theories are fully characterised by the statistics of the quasiparticles.\nBosonic theories may be also characterised by the statistics of the quasiparticles if these degrees of freedom are described by anyonic quasiparticles, in this case they are related by\n\\begin{equation}\nk_i= 4 \\int d^2 r S_{i,i}(r)^2 +2 \\int d^2 r {\\vec s_{i,i} (r) \\cdot \\vec s_{i,i} (r) }.\n\\end{equation}\n\\end{description}\nThe fermionic and bosonic theories on topological phases are characterised by different topological properties, but the same abelian topological charges.\n\nFor this reason, in the following discussion we will separate, as usual for bosons, the study of the non-abelian topological phases from fermions and abelian topological orders \\cite{Moore1991}.\n\n\\subsubsection{A unitary gauge transformation}\n\nLet us suppose that the system we want to evaluate the NATC over is described by the following Hamiltonian which includes a pair of gauge fields:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nH = H_0(G) + \\frac{H_1(G)}{2 \\pi},\n\\label{UnitaryGauge}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $H_1$ is the gauge field and $H_0$ denotes an on-site term. The Hamiltonian in eq. (\\ref{UnitaryGauge}) can also be considered as a gauge invariant Hamiltonian, since it is invariant with respect to any unitary transformation $U$, $H(U) = H(1)$, which is a symmetry of the Hamiltonian with respect to the gauge degrees of freedom. When we want to perform a measurement only on the gauge degrees of freedom, the Hamiltonian in eq. (\\ref{", "label": "llama"}

The site uses a new system called CC Search Selector that makes searching for images, video and audio a lot more focused.\nIf you go via the CC Search home page, there is the usual search box with the Advanced and Keyword Searches – there are 24 categories to choose from. Then, below are the various search pages.\nI selected “Art” and the Advanced Search and searched “Cinema and Theater”\nI got 34 results which I could narrow down by keywords, the date (which seems unusual since the period is 0-19 years), the copyright status (free for reuse or not) and the collection. I chose Free For Non Commercial Use only and in my results box I got 9 results.\nI noticed that there was a button “Adjust Image Size” which will scale the image size to about 1/5th to 0.5 of the original image size.\nI selected “Art” again and chose Keyword Search. I added “theater” and “actresses” and clicked Search. I am very interested and I am just starting to play with CC by this time.\nI did find the 3 images I wanted on the first page. The first one, I clicked the image name to go to the full page of details, and as I scrolled down, the image is of course, displayed in full size. Then on the right hand side, I clicked the green “View as Free (reuse)” and the page went to a full page of view and on the left had, I could select any size I wanted or select the Adjust Image Size button as I did earlier. The image I wanted was a headshot of actress Kathryn Leigh Scott and was 5350 X 2596 pixels in size, I clicked that and got the file with the dimensions of 2592 x 1392 pixels.\nI did it again and saved the image at a size of 1440 x 960 pixels and there are also other sizes (2560 x 1600 and 1024 x 768 pixels) that I can save as well. Here’s the new size I selected – this way I can save the image size that I needed and there were more available.\nWhile on the CC Search selector page, I am searching for “theater”\nAs you can see, there is a page of 23 results and I just clicked the keyword of theater, it took me to the page of results.\nI selected the image size – see the screen images for clarity\nI can also click anywhere on the search page and the selection of the image size will change.\nI also did a search for “actress” and this is the results page.\nClicking anywhere on the image of choice will show the CC Search Selector page.\nI did the same for the second result which is a picture of Jane Russell and William Holden.\nThen I tried a different category and my results were like this – which is the usual full page search. I tried out the same keyword search for “theater” and got 3 results.\nThen for the other keyword search, I got a results page with 870 results.\nIf I hover my cursor on any particular search result, a tiny thumbnail will appear.\nWhat I liked with the CC Searching system is that it is easy to find particular images and video by doing a keyword search. Searching for video was much better than before because the size options are more focused and because of advanced search, you could find specific images in specific categories, such as the people or film festival type events. The quality also seems to have improved.\nCC Search is a great search engine because of its focus, the large database, and the fact that I do not have to go through a whole big and confusing list of millions of images. I can go right to a list of 24 categories and search within a certain group, even though the entire CC database is there; I just select a collection and then focus the search on just that. The Adjust Image Size was also a plus factor because although I liked the fact that the default size was a more manageable size I could easily select a size that was more manageable to my intended use of the image.\nI didn’t test out the sound files because I feel that it is difficult, especially when you are using the Advanced Search, to tell exactly what you want by keyword search but I like that the new design looks more presentable.

{"text": "On watching this film, I was amazed at how media has changed over the past 21 years. People will always criticize the film. Everyone is a critic, isn’t it? Personally, I enjoyed it, because even though a lot has changed, most aspects like the use of a video camera, a walkie-talkie and a TV screen being used for important calls, remains the same.\nThe first part reminded me of ‘War Games’ where a group of kids hacked the US defense system. Some things like the video recording of the event, the voice calling on the phone when the main hero has to get up, and the use of a ham radio were the same in that movie.\nIt is a story that revolves around a bunch of 13-year-old school boys who get into trouble when they hack into the Pentagon computer systems by mistake. The boys manage to download a program which causes the world to believe that the US is under attack from Russia. The movie has the added element of the boys creating viruses to infect the school’s system. That was quite a bit of info for kids to handle at that age. It was the first movie to show some of the dangers the Internet could create in the future. But the computer effects are not all that impressive nowadays.\nThe actors are all unknown. But they did a marvelous job. This is the story of some outcast kids who decide to write and direct a video for a school competition. They don’t have any good ideas so they decide to take a movie clip to use in the video. They hack into the Pentagon’s computer system and accidentally download the most powerful war game ever written. They start playing the game and find out that one of the games is the simulation of a real nuclear attack from Russian missiles headed straight for the United States. The computer’s simulation says that the U. S. Defense systems are not ready, so they have 64 minutes to launch nuclear counter strikes or the country will be wiped out. This movie contains an unforgettable performance from Christian Slater. His character, Elmo, has just been released from reform school. He ends up becoming the leader of the group and they enlist the help of one of the school’s most popular teachers, played by Bill Mumy. They are not all that interested when it comes to aiding the U. S. Government, but after hearing the news, they are forced to do what they can to help. There are some exciting scenes in the movie where the kids are shown struggling to create counter strikes, and all the while avoiding the government and all the authorities pursuing them. This is the first time most of the kids will see a real nuclear bomb go off before their eyes. A great sound track as well. The movie is a really good one, and if you haven’t seen it already, I highly recommend it. Not to be confused with the movie called ‘Deep Blue Sea’.", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "purpose of this study was to evaluate the lymphocyte populations of normal and diseased pigs to determine the differences between them, which may be caused by stress, diseases and aging.\nTwenty healthy pigs with a mean weight, backfat thickness and age of 90 11 days were raised in a natural environment in the farm. Three health diseased pigs with weight, backfat thickness and age of 255 25 days were raised in the experimental condition of the farm. Two groups of pigs were processed for immunohistochemistry and the results were compared with the pig immunohistochemistry protocol.\nThe results of this study showed a significant difference in the distribution of intracellular calcium (CIC) in the lymphocytes of both normal and diseased pigs with regard to time, weight, sex and disease. The expression of glucose transporters and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDE) in T and B lymphocytes were significantly different between the normal and diseased pigs with reference to age, which decreased in all cases. The study of lymphocyte subcom-ponent populations showed that all populations differed in normal pigs compared to diseased pigs. The differences in the number of gammadelta T-cells for age and weight in diseased compared to normal pigs were statistically significant (P 0.05) from normal pigs.\nThe authors propose that the lymphocytes act as an early warning system for internal changes and abnormalities, where the immune system increases activity to fight against stress, environment and diseases.\nA lymphocyte’s ability to respond to stress is related to a normal cell’s ability to adjust their cellular and molecular structures. This function is based on the activation of the nuclear and membrane components in the cell (Ala, 1996).\nStress may have different influences on the immune system and its function.\nThe most important ones are:\n- Inflammatory response activation: The production of cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory factors.\n- Activation of immune cells and their role in lymphocytes: Activated lymphocytes produce inflammatory chemokines and cytokines and take up bacteria and antigens.\n- Lymphocyte migration to the site of injury and cell death: Lymphocytes migrate to the site of injury and inflammation, and under the stress of tissue injury and death, these cells increase their role in the site of tissue damage.\n- Change of the lymphocytes’ function, for example increasing the activity of phagocytosis.\nStress is considered a major factor of disease and aggression in the pigs (Ramaswamy, 2002) and one of the most important risk factors in many viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, such as: BVD, MDBV, EIDV, PRRS, porcine parvovirus (PPV) PED, porcine enteric diarrhea (PED), swine influenza, influenza, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, PRRS, enteric coronavirus (enteroCV), coronavirus PC, coronavirus in pigs PCV, corona virus in swine PCV, porcine corona virus (PCV).\nIn addition to stress, aging of pigs has been shown as a cause of the development or severity of diseases, which includes the effects of inflammatory response activation, activation of immune cells and changes in lymphocyte sub-populations. The authors studied the immune system of pigs and evaluated the lymphocyte population to explain the mechanisms that occur during stress and aging.\n- Study the immune system of pigs by evaluation immune systems.\n- Study the lymphocyte subpopulations in normal and diseased pigs at different ages.\n- Study the activity of glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE) and immune cells as indicators of stress in normal and diseased pigs.\n- Study the distribution of intracellular calcium (CIC) in lymphocytes in normal and diseased pigs at different ages.\n- Evaluation of the distribution of glucose transporters (GLUT) in lymphocytes of normal and diseased pigs at different ages\n- 10 000 p", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "uncorrected numbers appear in official census reports.)In 1990, the Hispanic-origin population accounted for 9.9 percent of the national total, nearly triple the 4.1 percent that made up the population a decade earlier. Most of that 5.8-percent increase in the Hispanic-origin population was due to higher birth rates among Hispanic women, not to the higher level of immigrations noted earlier. As of June 30, 1990, there were 6.0 million persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin living in the United States who were either born in Spain, Portugal, or Latin America and were not necessarily of Hispanic origin 25 or of Spanish culture. Those persons of Hispanic origin who were born in Central or South America are almost entirely of Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin.\nLANGUAGE USAGE AMONG POPULATIONS OF HISPANIC ORIGIN\nThe terms Hispanic, Spanish, and Latin are often used interchangeably; however, linguists and other scholars consider the definitions for Hispanic and Latin languages to be somewhat broader. Latin as a linguistic and cultural designation is used to refer to those who lived in Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, and their overseas empire in earlier centuries, as well as other Latin American populations. The number of Latin-speaking persons in the United States doubled in the past three decades, increasing from 0.9 million in the 1960 decennial census to 2.3 million in 1990 (table 3). In the latter year, Spanish was used at home by approximately 31.1 million persons, or 34.7 percent of all U.S. residents.3 Of those who spoke Spanish at Home, 73.4 percent were Hispanic and 9.7 percent were non-Hispanic white, the fastest growing minority groups in the nation. The Hispanic-origin population of the country had doubled during the 1980s. By the end of 1989, the Hispanic population was more than 36 times its size in 1920.\nThe proportion of Spanish-speakers in the United States increased from 17.4 percent in 1960 to 17.8 percent in 1970, fell slightly to 17.6 percent in 1980 and 1980, and then rose again to 18.3 percent in 1990. In 1980, the total number of foreign Spanish speakers was 16.6 million, while the number speaking English at home was 241.7 million. At home, 51.1 million lived among 18 million non-Hispanics. Among Spanish-speakers, about one-half were bilingual,2 and in most cases they spoke primarily Spanish at home, while speaking English at work, school, and elsewhere. Those who spoke English predominantly at home numbered 14.8 million, more than twice as many as those who spoke Spanish only at home. In 1990, Puerto Ricans, who accounted for 79.5 percent of Americans of Spanish speaking ancestry, had higher median incomes than most foreign-born and domestic speaking groups, and their unemployment rate was less than that of foreign-born, native (including native-born native), and all speaking groups. A Puerto Rican family was also more likely than all Spanish-language groups other than native-born native Spanish speakers to possess a home and automobile.\nIn 1990, 24.4 million American residents used Spanish to share a portion of daily activities. In most instances, they combined Spanish-language usage with English, which made them bilingual. About 40.3 percent of those aged 5 and older used only Spanish at home, while only 8.1 percent primarily used English to communicate with their family. The largest Spanish-speaking group was Mexicans, at 35.1 percent. More speakers of Mexican ancestry lived in the United States than of any other national-ancestry group, and with the exception of the United States in California and Texas, the highest population density was found in New York. The second largest group, Puerto Ricans, accounted for 22.1 percent of all Americans of Spanish speaking ancestry, but only 5.9 percent of the Hispanic population. Although Puerto Ricans lived in more than one-half of the states, the majority still lived in New York or New Jersey.\n", "label": "llama"}

He was convicted on the basis of a confession to Samantha’s murder and a DNA test – in 1988 and 1991 – that connected him to her body, but he maintains that he was beaten in order to get him to sign the confession and he is convinced his DNA is a fraud.\nThe first confession made no sense: Pitchfork said he had been picked up by a couple driving near his home, and sexually abused, before being taken to the field. The woman in the car had a cut above her eyebrow, an exact replica of the cut left on Samantha Knight’s forehead. He claimed it was a bite, but later admitted “he bit her”.\nHe was sentenced to two life sentences for murder at Nottingham Crown Court in 1988. His sentence was later reduced to 35 years on appeal, but on 17 December 1991 he walked free from court. When he left custody, the police found no evidence that he was a danger to the public.\nSamantha’s mother, Linda, fought long and hard to overturn Pitchfork’s conviction. In 1998 DNA testing showed that his DNA profile did not match with the semen and blood found at the scene of the crime: he was given a discretionary life term but refused to admit to the crime. In 2005 he was given a whole-life jail term. This is his story.\nWords: Sarah Freeman\n1983: Samantha Knight, 15, from Burton Latimer, goes missing\nShe was last seen walking to her home from Scalford Country Club, seven miles outside Lutterworth, Leicestershire, where she had gone for a family get-together.\nSamantha’s mother, Linda, reported her missing. Samantha had already told a family friend that she was worried about the friend’s sexual conduct towards her, and had been making plans to leave her older boyfriend of four months, with whom she was living.\nSamantha’s family reported her missing to the police after she failed to return home from a club and had gone to a party. In the days that followed, the Police hunted for Samantha but there was no sign of her.\nSamantha’s family searched for her at her friend’s home before going to Samantha’s boyfriend’s house to look for her with his parents. They found a scrap of fabric with her knickers on it that had been shed in the car she had arrived in.\nThey also discovered a cassette with the track, ‘Let’s Make Lots Of Love’, playing on it, which was being sold illegally by the boyfriend’s father who ran an illegal record shop.\nSamantha’s cousin had recognised the song. She had heard it from when Samantha had been staying at her house the previous week. The boyfriend’s father, John Pullinger, was interviewed but he gave an alibi.\n1984: Man arrested over murder of Samantha Knight\nThe first suspect in the Samantha Knight murder was Stephen Hicks, who admitted to the murder of Samantha while being questioned by police. On 22 June 1984, Hicks was found guilty of rape. But the police were convinced Hicks was the man who had raped and killed Samantha Knight. But Hicks was never convicted. He served two and a half years of his five-year sentence. Hicks claimed he was innocent and, unlike Colin Pitchfork, denied that DNA evidence proved he was responsible for the crime.\nHicks was tried for her ra", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it first aired as a 100th Anniversary production this year — I had always heard of it and I was a fan of the writer and co-star Orson Welles. It was a chance to see one of the most unique filmmakers of the 20th century make another film, to see what kind of performance his “lost boy” character gave and what kind of contribution he made to the final product. (Of course, this film was shot after a starring role in Macbeth on Broadway and before Citizen Kane.)\nWelles was definitely at his best here, portraying a character far more sympathetic than most of his other roles and acting on-par with many Hollywood movie stars of the time. He’s the lost boy, and all Welles has to do is act and look good. Other parts are filled by a bunch of big-name actors of the day who give serviceable performances, but it’s Welles who holds the film together — and it can be forgiven any weaknesses in the film as a whole. I’m not sure what I was expecting, but the film definitely had more appeal than any “adventure tale” I’ve seen before and probably a lot more historical accuracy than you’ll find in your average Disney fairytale. There’s also a bit of humor in the dialogue and action, though it’s more obvious at first than by the time Welles is introduced (or, rather, not).\nIf you’re expecting anything other than “swashbuckling fun adventure”, this may disappoint you a little. It’s no Master of Disguise (how ironic that that’s a Disney film, isn’t it?). But if you can manage to suspend your disbelief for a while, you can find enjoyment in this one — especially if you have any experience in acting or directing.\nMovies1930s, 1940s, adventure, black-and-white, cinema, film, film review, movie review, movies, period\nKubrick on Kubrick: Interviews with Stanley Kubrick\nNovember 1, 2011 October 28, 2011 Anabella2 Comments\n“The film-maker’s art, like all other arts, has two distinct and often antagonistic impulses: the one to make things as they are: the other, to falsify things as they are; or rather as they are felt, for the most important problem a film-maker has to solve is the relationship of the cinematic medium to life. One wants to make films which do not distort life, but, at the same time, one also wants films which help us to live. We accept a film and say it is a beautiful film, while in fact it is a lie (as many lies as its merits), but it was a lie the camera was able to tell. One’s art is never a mirror; it is a more interesting thing, it is a sort of lie; it is a half-truth, so, you can’t just take it as a matter of fact.”\nThat is from the introduction to the 1978 book interview compilation Kubrick on Film. It explains exactly the attitude most cinematic storytellers have, the paradox between the truth of cinema (everything in the picture “is shown”) and the interpretation and embellishment that make a given film art. This book is an outstanding exploration of the cinematic craft — it collects interviews from 1968 through 1987, giving Kubrick’s views throughout a variety of films. And it’s a book that has been on my shelf for more than 20 years, and just recently became a priority for me; after nearly a decade of writing my own fiction, it was only natural that I should want to read Kubrick’s words on storytelling.\nKubrick’s style of storytelling is distinctive, to say the least. His stories — or rather, the stories he adapts and creates (or, rather, co-creates) — often begin without any idea as to what’s going to happen. Like so many screenwriters, he begins with a character and has that character do something; the situation, theme, and story come later. This often results in a narrative feeling incomplete, the events taking place one after another with no apparent logic in the storytelling.\nStylistically, his films are also notable in that they “speak” very little dialogue; characters “speak” with their actions and dialogue is more a device to", "label": "llama"}

This allows us to define a conditional mutual information as the vonNeumann relative entropy for this probability P[a|b]. In general, a Bell inequality can be defined as the maximum of the vonNeumann relative entropy between two subsystems. Since b and a are non-local variables, this definition of Bell’s inequality is impossible. However, it's possible with the Bennett causal formalism (2003).\nThe Bell inequalities which are derived from this formalism are Bell's inequalities because the conditional mutual informations that are used as variables in the inequality are conditional to local variables, which can be measured in experiment.\nOne possible scenario could be that of a toy experiment where the experimentalists would...\nOne possible scenario could be that of a toy experiment where the experimenter observes the following local variables:\nAlice: A and Z\nBob: B and Z\nAlice and Bob could choose to measure their variable of choice at time t=0 or t=1, in order to minimize the conditional vonNeumann relative entropy. If Alice chose to measure her variable of choice at time (t=0) and Bob chose to measure his variable of choice one unit of time later, this would violate Bell's inequality. This is because, if it wasn't done with the goal of minimizing the conditional vonNeumann relative entropy, there would have been an event within this two unit time interval which was correlated with the choice of Alice and Bob. However, as the choice of the event and the choice of Alice and Bob are random, we can state that they are uncorrelated, which requires the violation of Bell's inequality.\nThis is the same principle as that of the toy experiment in which the experimenter is free to decide whether to change Z between the measurement of Alice and the measurement of Bob.\nThis toy experiment is equivalent to the one in which the experimenter has the freedom to decide whether to observe Z, and is equivalent to the toy experiment of having conditional mutua l information.\nLet's call the former the toy experiment \"the choice of time interval\" and the toy...\nLet's call the former the toy experiment \"the choice of time interval\", and the latter \"the conditional mutual information\"\nSo, the first important aspect is that in the \"choice of time interval\" the time interval is not random. This is because the experimenter can choose to observe Z at either time interval, so it's actually the choice that is not random.\nNow, let's call that \"the random choice of time\"\nThe second important concept is that there is a causal order between the conditioning variables in the case of \"the choice of time interval\" and between the local variables in the case of \"the conditional mutual information\".\nThe causal order between the conditioning variables in \"the choice of time interval\" has a certain temporal order which is not the same as the temporal order of the conditional mutual information.\nLet me try to explain this.\nIn the toy experiment \"the choice of time interval\", there will be a sequence of local variables A,...\nIn the toy experiment \"the choice of time interval\", there will be a sequence of local variables A, Z and B.\nThe conditioning variables associated with this toy experiment are Z, since it's the event that is associated with the variable that is being randomly chosen, and A, because it's at the very beginning; it's the first choice that one makes when beginning a choice. The events associated with Z in the \"choice of time interval\" have a chronologic order.\nIn the toy experiment with the causal inference \"the conditional mutual information\", however,...the causal order of the conditioning variables is different.\nIn the conditional mutual information, we have a sequence of conditional mutual information variables: A, Z, and B.

{"text": "Mitt Romney is all about dismantling the federal government's role in people's lives, and would slash funds for education, health, infrastructure and virtually all other federal government services. This includes drastic cuts to Medicaid, which funds home health care for many older and disabled Americans, and, in many cities, the only thing that keeps children fed and housed.\nMitt Romney's policies would make us poorer.\nWorse yet, his tax plan would turn the country into a massive Ponzi scheme that would make us all richer, just for a while.\nMitt Romney's policies would make everyone poorer.\nBecause the cost of his tax cuts can't be borne by the rich - they wouldn't have enough money to pay it all, after all - he'd have to raise taxes sharply on everyone. Either that, or slash spending so drastically that essential services would crumble. But he won't do that. That would hurt the rich, too.\nBecause Mitt Romney's tax plan cuts the taxes of the top 1 percent by about $200,000 a year, and the taxes of the top 0.1 percent by closer to $1 million, the people that need and deserve those tax breaks so much are the ones who would receive them.\nInstead, middle-class tax cuts would be revenue-neutral, meaning Mitt Romney would raise taxes on everyone else to pay for the breaks for the rich.\nBut that's precisely what's wrong. That's not a tax cut. It's a transfer.\nMiddle and lower-income people pay more in taxes. They get less. Upper-income people pay the same, the tax rates on their income-tax returns, but they get a lot more money.\nHere's how it works. Under the Romney plan, 75 percent of Americans' tax returns get a tax increase. A tax increase. But Mitt Romney's plan doesn't get rid of tax loopholes. It keeps them.\nSo if you're thinking, \"But what if Congress were to follow through and actually do something about special deals that only apply to the big 1 percent of the super-rich?\" Well, that's not going happen. Not in today's bitter fight where everything has to be passed with a 60-vote, filibuster-proof Senate (Romney is on record as opposing even a modest increase to the minimum tax for the 50,000 people in America who have an income over $1 million but less than a million, which, as you might suspect, mostly aren't Mitt Romney).\nSo, no. Tax increases for 75 percent of American taxpayers won't happen. But there's a whole lot of extra money for Mitt Romney in your paycheck or tax refund.\nBut what about the economy? That's where Mitt Romney would really hurt all of us.\nWe've got it all pretty good now, but he'd slash government spending so much, economist Jason Furman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers calculates in a study of the plan's macroeconomic effects, it would cause a 6.8 million job loss.\nThat's a lot. That's almost 10 percent of all the wage and salary income in the country. So it's a big job. (And, as a reminder, President Obama's plan would create jobs. All of 'em.)\nHe'd reduce the size of government in half.\nBut as economist Romer said, \"If (Mitt Romney) didn't care about helping people and just decided to do it to balance the federal budget, it does become a tax cut for everybody.\"\nYes. A tax increase and job losses would balance the federal budget, if you're rich, by cutting spending on you.\nBut Mitt Romney would reduce the size of the federal government by about half.\nI know some liberals might think that's a good thing.\nThe problem with that math: The federal government spends your money more productively than you do. It's not what Mitt Romney's people say, it's an established principle of economics, called \"market failure.\" You don't spend your money in your self-interest, you spend money for yourself that may also benefit others.\nFor example, if the federal government didn't exist, there'd be no National Weather Service, and you might find it cheaper to pay for food rather than pay for air pollution control.", "label": "llama"}
{"text": "Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node in which the connection is agreed upon in the network. To establish a connection between an initiating node and the responding node, a handshaking protocol is employed: a message is transmitted by the initiating node to the responding node to request the connection. The responding node then checks if it is within range of the initiating node, and if it is, will either accept or reject the request. The connection is then initialized, which involves the exchange of connection establishment and releasing headers during the connection lifetime. The protocol for the exchange of connection establishment and releasing headers is specified by ITU-T [10].\nTo make the channel in the transmission a virtual channel, the packetization layer of the network encapsulates the transmitted data into IP packets. Because the connection itself is already defined in the network, the packet headers are only concerned with the transport layer protocol of the upper layer. The transport layer (in this case UDP) is responsible for the segmentation, reordering, and fragmentation of the packets. Apart from that it is responsible for the error detection and correction, and the flow and congestion control in the network.\nThe transport layer establishes the connection at the application level. The connection is a logical connection consisting of two endpoints, the initiating point and the responding point. The connection endpoints are not necessarily on a physical common network. To transfer the data packets between the endpoints, a network address in the upper layer protocols (Layer 4) must be attached to each packet.\nWhen a packet reaches the destination end of the connection, the upper layer protocol will unpack the header and check whether this is the correct packet. If the packet is correctly received and verified, the application level will check if the data payload has arrived correctly. If this is correct, the packet will be reassembled and handled by the upper layer protocol. If the data payload is not correctly received or in any way corrupted, it will be resent. This is because a packet has always reliable end-to-end delivery, regardless of the type of transmission media the packet uses. This property of transmission is called the principle of end-to-end delivery. To improve reliability, it is recommended practice to employ error control techniques such as cyclic redundancy checking[6].\nFigure 3 Network Architecture: the connection is between two nodes in a network\nApplication layer, Application layer, Application layer, The connection is end-to-end transparent, which is, to the upper layer protocols.\nFor UDP service, the sender does not need to guarantee that a whole application data frame reaches its destination. UDP transport layer protocols provide an additional option, namely the window service, which can reduce the number of re-transmissions. This option is optional and may be implemented only if the application has chosen to implement it.\nThe UDP does not make a distinction between the data transfer and the control transfer of its transport layer protocols. By default, whenever the host in UDP sends a packet, it cannot distinguish whether this involves the actual data transmission to be controlled or part of the data transmission to be controlled. That is, it is possible for every time UDP to send a sequence of packets to the server. This may result in packets that only control and not the data to be transmitted. This function allows the transmission of UDP packet data to be controlled in a timely manner using only a single UDP packet.\nIf it is required to perform a transmission of data data, a single UDP packet can be sent by a UDP host. The server expects UDP to receive 1 byte of data, for example 100 characters. If less data is received, the server can send the remaining number of characters to be transmitted. However, the host does not know this. Since each piece of data is an unrelated UDP packet, which the host itself created, the server may not know exactly what data the client expects, and how many bytes of data it would like to send. This causes the problem mentioned in the introduction that there should be an error in the transmission to be able to resend data after a timeout.\nThe data packet to be transmitted must have a number in the UDP header for data segment number (Data-seq number). This value represents the number of bytes of the current package. With this information, the host can request the server to send the missing bytes of the data. For example, if 100 characters are to be transmitted, the client should send the UDP header data sequence 0 1. The host does not send the characters it receives, but with this number of bytes to be received, the server sends 100 bytes of data to the client. As a result the UDP client receives 200", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "background : during off - pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery a patient is required to maintain supine position throughout the procedure. Sternal retractor is used to keep the sternum immobilized and elevated during the surgery. The primary object of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of different types and brands of sternal retractors over others. Materials and Methods: In this randomized, double - blind study 120 adult patients undergoing OPCAB by a senior cardiac surgeon, having a body mass index less than 30 were included. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups-the Sternal Retractor and the Standard Inferior Retractor group. Patient saturation as obtained from oxygen saturation probe, time taken from admission to induction of anesthesia, time taken till sternotomy, procedure time, total duration of stay of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), and incidence of sternal wound infection were noted at weekly intervals for a period of eight weeks. Results: In this study group, there were 60 patients in each group. The sternal retractions were comparable in both the groups, and a statistically significant difference was observed in the duration of stay in the ICU (P < 0.05). The duration of stay of patients in our study was considerably less than the average hospital stay in patients after OPCAB. The retractors had a definite effect on duration of stay in ICU and hospital cost. Conclusions: We conclude that use of lightweight aluminum sternal retractor has a definite effect in reducing intensive care stay in OPCAB patients.\nPatent ductus arteriosus is a heart ailment encountered in premature infants. It arises since the ductus arteriosus that passes blood from the pulmonary to the aorta prior to birth is still open as compared to adults in whom this has closed.

Results: Four patients accounted for the overall incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) as a cause of clinical presentation. Mean age was 62 years. One had atherosclerotic disease, three others presented with chronic abdominal pain and a ruptured pouch-anterior wall aneurysm. Two patients had surgical aneurysmal excision and the remaining three had repair.

Screening mammography has significantly reduced deaths due to breast cancer in white women; however, the impact of such mammography screening has not been well studied and investigated in women of other races.

{"text": "\"Your iron industry is dead, dead as mutton. Your coal production is low: the mines are short of coal, yet the iron industry is to be restored, as though these things were compatible. The whole system becomes a chaos of waste, inefficiency and mismanagement\"\n\"In the face of this reality what does the Government decide to do? Cut up the old iron into bits and build two new engines for £95,000. They will work quite nicely, I am sure...it was just sheer extravagance.\"\n\"A few years ago one might have called some of these things extravagance, but one might equally have called some of this waste - your Government is just extravagant\"\nWoodford was right of course. The idea that the war would stimulate economic demand was an illusion: the reality of the state of the British economy was hidden from public gaze by nationalized industry and the military-industrial complex.\nAt the same time, a powerful section of British society was prepared to look the other way as government used the state-planned economy as its tool to ensure that the real winners gained in the first and last war Britain had fought on its own behalf. The political and commercial elites did not see the military-industrial complex as an entity which had been used to help them gain power, but as something which they were in the midst of creating. In this sense, the military-industrial complex was a revolution, one of the mechanisms by which British industrialists gained their supremacy.\nIt is hard to know which was more surprising. Either that the British Government had fallen so completely under the influence of its powerful industrial partners or that they had failed to recognize that they had done so.\nBritain's post-war industrial revival, in contrast to the debacle of the first world war, would be in a different sense inseparable. That is what the interwar period is about.", "label": "llama"}

{"text": "a 60-year male was admitted with advanced renal failure and was put on treatment. Two months later, while being treated in hospital the patient committed suicide.\na 61-year male patient underwent a successful cadaveric renal transplant on 21-08-1982. Post renal transplant, no treatment or medication were prescribed. Patient started having renal problems and was admitted to hospital on 08-01-1984. The patient was diagnosed to have acute rejection of graft and was treated with various modes of treatment, including corticosteroids. However, due to adverse effects of corticosteroids, the dose was slowly reduced. However, since no improvement in the condition was observed, the patient was again diagnosed with graft rejection and corticosteroids were given in the dose of 100 mg (oral)/ four times, which were gradually reduced. The patient remained in hospital for four months, during which time he developed various signs and symptoms of atherosclerosis. The patient was later treated with coronary artery bypass surgery, which was reportedly successful. Later, since the patient developed further cardiac problems and was not improving, he was admitted to hospital on 26-05-1987. He remained in the hospital for a week and expired on 30-05-1987. After preliminary analysis, he was reportedly diagnosed to have acute rejection of graft. As a part of the investigation, the patient’s family was interviewed.\nWhen the patient was admitted to the hospital in 1984, since the patient was asymptomatic, the patient’s family was not aware of any history suggestive of acute rejection of graft. However, the patient was undergoing relapse of disease and was on treatment at that point of time for graft rejection.\nIn 1987 also, when the patient reportedly died, the patient’s family denied any history suggestive of rejection. However, reanalysis of records showed that during admission in 1984, a diagnosis of rejection of graft had been recorded and on the basis of which corticosteroid treatment along with other medication was given.\nAtherosclerosis is considered to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the cardiac patients. Atherosclerosis as a cause of death in a patient after renal transplantation would be explained by the following: (i) the kidneys get injured by the deposit of lipids in the circulation. This subsequently leads to damage in the renal vessels due to which the organ loses its function.\nKidneys get injured by the atherosclerotic process in the arterial blood and arterial anaemia becomes more prominent than usual, leading to compromise in organ perfusion. This results in ischaemia ultimately causing injury leading to tissue necrosis.\nKidney injury due to atherosclerosis cannot be explained by immunosuppression as post-transplant atherosclerosis is a common occurrence, and has been considered even in kidney transplanted from a living kidney donor and not from a deceased donor. Atherosclerosis may worsen the situation in transplant patients and predispose them to early death. It may explain the findings in this case report. The fact that the patient had no cardiac complaints during this latest hospitalisation probably reflects an important aspect which should be recognized in postrenal transplant patients – the high prevalence of silent atherosclerosis in this group of patients, which is one of the most common reasons reported for deaths in these individuals.\nSince there were no clinical findings to suggest the same, atherosclerosis had to be assumed as the cause of death. This was further supported by finding of calcium in the coronary arteries on autopsy but not on postmortem examination, findings of which were not present in the case of rejection of graft.\nAtherosclerosis is a multifactorial process involving endothelial dysfunction and immunological, genetic, environmental and thrombogenic factors. The disease is a frequent finding not only in patients with renal transplantation, but also in other patients with anatomical abnormalities of the coronary arteries. Atherosclerosis is a common finding in post-transplant patients and may be a frequent and insidious cause of heart disease in transplant recipients. When", "label": "llama"}
