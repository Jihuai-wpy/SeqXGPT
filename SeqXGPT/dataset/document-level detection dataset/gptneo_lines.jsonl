{"text": "quantum decoherence can arise due to classical fluctuations in the coupling between the two modes. In a regime where the interaction is small but still fluctuates between a low and a high value, the decoherence is much more evident since the low coupling mode enters the interaction dynamics twice (once for the preparation of the excitation and once for the decay of that excitation) and therefore enters in some way into all the dynamical processes of the system. This is the essence of quantum correlation: the effect of quantum noise on the quantum operations is often greater than the effect of quantum fluctuations alone (see discussion of the effect of noise in a qubit system in Ref.[@ref31]), even in the case where the only source of such noise is the quantum fluctuations of the coupling. The quantum correlation is closely related with entanglement, which as we discussed above, is the cornerstone of information processing.\n\nWe note that the model of a single mode interacting with an environment (the single mode bath) at zero temperature which is a fundamental element of such models describing coupling of photons to a single vibrational mode in the ground state of a solid was first investigated theoretically by Duan et al. [@ref32]. They found that if the environment mode was coupled to the mode in a way that the system modes can exchange energy with the mode only when the total energy $E$ of the system+environment is a positive multiple of the energy level spacing $\\hbar \\omega$, then entanglement is present provided that the quantum interference can occur (i.e., both the modes are initially in the $n,n+1$ state). They proposed a model in which the modes interact during the passage of a single photon by passing one mode through the environment, which can be a bath, cavity or oscillator. In Fig.\\[fig1\\] the interaction of a single mode (the bath or cavity mode) with an environment (mode 2 or another bath or cavity, or oscillator in the Duan et al. model) is such that the energy of the interaction system is a positive multiple of the energy level spacing and the excitation transfer is then possible only upon completion of some quantum phase process. With such a model they also showed, interestingly, that the entanglement and the coherence are present and that the quantum interference acts as a witness against the presence of entanglement.\n\n![\\[fig1\\](Color online) Schematic diagram of a single mode interacting with an environment at zero temperature.](fig1.eps){width=\"0.50\\hsize\"}\n\nThis model can be extended to include multiple baths and a general oscillator by introducing a number of modes $m$ in Eq.(1) in a similar way as in the case of the multiple-bath case where the second mode can be coupled to a bath at a rate $\\gamma$ or to a cavity at a rate $\\kappa$. We note that even in the multiple-bath case the energy $E$ of the total system is a positive multiple of the energy level spacing at any time.\n\n![(Color online) Schematic diagram of a system consisting of a single mode plus a mode coupled to an environment. The quantum interference effect is due to the fact that the modes can communicate via a path which includes both the modes (for the case $m\\ne 0$). The energy of the total system is now a positive multiple of the energy level spacing $\\hbar \\omega_0$.](fig2.eps){width=\"0.50\\hsize\"}\n\nTo investigate further into this model we now study a spin system as an example of a system consisting of a single mode plus a mode coupled to an environment (see Fig.\\[fig2\\]). We again assume that the mode has constant energy independent on the quantum number $z$. Moreover, the case $m\\ne 0$ is taken into account such that the modes can pass through the environment and interact with it. The Hamiltonian for this system is obtained by inserting the mode frequency $\\omega(t)$ in Eq.(1) into $\\hat{H}_{0}$ $$H_{1}=\\hbar \\omega(t)\\sigma_{z}/2$$ where we assume that the environment mode has the same energy $\\hbar \\omega_0$ and $\\hbar \\omega(t)$ is the total energy. The interaction Hamiltonian acting on the spin is obtained from Eq.(1) by inserting $H_{1}$ into $(\\hat{H}_{1}-\\hat{H}_{0})$ where $\\hat{H}_{1}$ contains a product of a spin 1 operator $\\sigma_{z}$ acting on the environmental mode with the environmental mode operator $\\sigma_r$ acting on both $\\hat{H}_{1}$ and $\\", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "According to Sheldon Ungar's comparison with global warming, the actors in the film that are actually in danger are not the large-scale polluters. They are the small-scale polluters.\n\nUngar, an environmental and energy consultant based in Austin, Texas, calls himself a \"pessimist\" but maintains his approach makes him very realistic. \"I look at everything as a worst case scenario.\"\n\nWhat does making films — particularly feature-length ones — actually do for people who think the world's got it in for them?\n\n\"I feel that it's a part of what we're here for,\" he told Business Insider. \"I personally feel, a little like I said to you that I don't believe the world's against people or even against us, but that it would help out if we don't fight. I feel that the world has chosen us, that's our role to play.\"\n\nThe argument that movies and Hollywood might actually be bringing about a better world has a long history and goes back several decades. There's a belief that with people spending time together in a communal manner, they might come together and start to treat each other with compassion. But it doesn't work like that: There are real-world examples where conflict leads to more conflict, and this tendency continues to create a \"film bubble,\" in which people seem to think that their private problems will be addressed by other people.\n\nA 2016 study by psychologists at the US Army War College found that the mere presence of a movie made people feel less safe, and made them worry their neighbors would leave their homes if they were attacked (a similar study found that the mere presence of reality TV was the most important factor in people becoming less afraid) and that it was the wrong choice to see what others were experiencing.\n\nA 2014 study in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found that young adults who spend their free time watching television are more likely to have poorer communication and social skills with their peers. They also have a harder time empathizing with others and having empathy. They are less effective than others at understanding the emotions of others. For that matter, there's a study published in the same year that found people thought someone would be a better parent if he watched a lot of video games.\n\nIt's not just that making a movie or the act of showing a movie can lead to negative consequences. There are also instances of real-world events taking place in the world in the absence of a feature film.\n\nIn 2013, the director of NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover, Andrew Coelho, died on the surface of Mars during a mission he'd spent years leading. Mars Pathfinder, the first rover to walk on the red planet, went even farther to bring back pictures of the entire planet. The mission lasted for over two years and the rover is still working (but no longer roving). Another story is the story of the three boys killed by a gunman in Newtown, CT, that was shown as a movie in 2012, only it wasn't shown as a movie and it didn't have the impact they wanted it to. The movie \"Lincoln\" became an Oscar-winning drama and the best movie of 2012.\n\nIn his book \"The Emperor's New Clothes: The Untold Story of the Battle Between Lies and Truth in the War on Terrorism,\" author Steven Casey says that when people complain about \"America\" it's really about what they have been conditioned to accept: \"The US-patronizing narrative of American supremacy and exceptionalism has been one of what's wrong with culture, in general, all along. If you want to find out about what's real and the truth, you don't have to go to Hollywood.\"\n\nCasey doesn't necessarily go as far as Ungar, but he says that the reality is that the film industry plays the role of protecting people from themselves. \"The industry has convinced people that because they are the dominant economic and cultural paradigm — you know, that is what we're told, it's not going to be the same every day — and because, you know, reality TV makes a certain amount of money and reality shows are the only things we're allowed to watch. It's a protection mechanism for the system. People are not going to find out they've been lied to.\"\n\nIn 2013, Ungar made a short film about the dangers of the film industry, \"How to Talk to a Movie Audience.\" The premise was that people were too gullible for their own good and did not believe anything they saw in Hollywood movies. The film was a comedy, but it did not shy away from the reality of Hollywood criticism: \"And I do think there are some films which are out of line. I also know that there are some films the audiences would like a little more realism in.\"\n\nUngar called the film an \"impressively optimistic way for me to address myself the way I see it in Hollywood,\" and while it didn't make a", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "measurements of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) temperature provide, respectively.\n\nThe igm is made up of  -sized particles as dark matter of roughly the size of the Milky Way, and an extremely, highly ionized plasma that fills the region between galaxy clusters (the Virgo cluster). In order to understand the origin of the igm, we must first understand how its large and relatively dense components formed.  The formation of the low density components can be understood by considering galaxy mergers. As galaxies merge, most of their baryonic matter is transferred to the more massive component. In most galaxies, the massive galaxy will then collapse into a black hole, and then a second generation of stars form in the newly formed bulge. This bulge and the new stellar material then collapse to become a large elliptical galaxy. The first generation of stars in the bulge will merge again and turn into a second group of low mass stars. The next stage of galaxy evolution is then one of hierarchical buildup, as most low mass galaxies merge to form the most massive galaxies, leading to a large elliptical galaxy such as the Milky Way. The stars forming in the galaxies that are merging together become hot (cool) and dense. While still being in the merger, some of these stars are being heated up by the large scale gravitational potential of the galaxies, in order to remain in a star forming galaxy and become active sources of luminosity (supernovae, gamma ray bursts). The heating of these stars then gradually cools them and makes them more massive and more luminous (and hotter and denser). The stars within these galaxies eventually settle down (turn off) all their internal nuclear stellar activities at a point when the internal temperature becomes close to their observed igm threshold. Once this occurs at a certain point, they become stable objects in the sense, the galactic imeasurements are not much dependent on their internal stellar physics or the galactic environment they were born in. By definition such stable objects have reached a igm threshold of roughly the right temperature and density regime for star formation. The  igm temperature and density has been determined for this galaxy by the star forming activity, and it is  imelike in the sense that the intergalactic medium has reached what is required for the formation of new stars. Other galaxies with ongoing star formation will reach this threshold at different times; but their properties will also continue to be igmlike since they will also have galaxies that started with star formation activity. When our Galaxy is formed out of gas and dust from galaxies merging together, most of the galaxies around us were star forming galaxies.\n\nWhen two stellar galaxies get closer to each other, they continue on merging together as described above, which causes the igm to be made-up of stars that were formed in the earlier massive galaxies. When two large elliptical galaxies merge, they then continue their merger to make a large elliptical galaxy by adding small amounts of stars to the merged galaxies. The galaxy merger then continues as a galaxy cycle of merging and dissolving. Stars that were formed in the earlier elliptical galaxies will merge into the current elliptical galaxy, and the old elliptical galaxies will become old disk galaxies. With the merging of these galaxies over time, they continue to grow and grow over time to become the modern galaxies we observe as our Milky Way.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n\nCategory:Star formation\nCategory:Stellar astrophysics", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering an all-too-typical slice of life on the French-Canadienne border, turned out to be far more than that, as was apparent from the opening scenes alone. And if one thing is true in this film—a woman's sexual awakening—it is that most men do not actually want what they seem to want; it is far more likely in their nature to desire much more, or much less than the woman's desire.\n\nDirector Claude Chabrol (who was, in fact, the real life father of the actor François Cluzet), set his films in the 1950s and '60s. This was an era of repression and taboos against sex, so such stories and the actors who played sex-crazed role models were not unknown in the French cinema, and often very popular in film fan magazines. What Chabrol also set out to do was to present a film that was not about sex, which he would film instead as a series of intimate and sensual conversations with his leading lady, Julie de Toulouse (Frédérique Blanchard), and the two young men who were a part of her inner circle of friends, the young artist and poet François (Michel Simon) and the young intellectual François-Xavier (Dany Boon), all three of them in love with each other. It was as if Chabrol, his screenwriter Christian Morin, and their French writer-director, Christian Petzold, had just come together to create a novel that could take a few months of very intense dialogue and very intimate scenes for the storyteller to finish, but in the form of a film that would be far shorter, in a much longer time.\n\n\"How did it start?\" Chabrol asked Pierre (Michel Simon).\n\n\"He had an article published in _Playboy_, and I had a story of my own to write for another magazine, and I asked if he would like to write and do an adaptation of his story? And he did. So that's where the idea came from.\"\n\n\"And you didn't do the adaptation directly from his story?\"\n\n\"No. I wrote the story, and I wrote the screenplay. And then I was offered the job of director. And I thought this was a wonderful opportunity, to create a film out of a story that was very close to me, that I had written and published. I don't know if he was happy about directing, but I was happy with the film we produced.\"\n\n\"And why do you have such strong feelings,\" asked Chabrol, \"about the story and the two characters he made?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Pierre admitted, \"it was so true. I don't know. To be honest, I don't have strong feelings about the characters when you make a movie of people you know.\"\n\n\"But in this case, you did.\"\n\n\"In this case? No, I don't. It's the story, I would like to say that, or that it was the character of Julie who had strong feelings. I don't know really. I can't explain.\" Michel Simon's face was suddenly thoughtful as he nodded to the director, and with a little laugh he added, \"No, it's not true.\" He stared at the director who was still standing there, a little embarrassed, while Pierre sat for a moment as if taking his thoughts into his own hands. Then he looked back at the director, his eyes sparkling, and once more the conversation picked up. \"He liked the characters very much,\" Michel Simon, and Chabrol now understood that this was precisely the case, that he had been unable to resist the temptation to portray the three young people who were very much at the center of his life, and in a way, and who had not the slightest interest in having him as a director. Chabrol was delighted. This was his chance. He could not afford to let this pass.\n\n\"I think you know,\" said Pierre, \"that as a young man I had spent some time in Africa, in the Sahara. I had read many books written by a man who had been there some years ago and had tried to understand how a tribe was organized, how the people treated each other. In particular, I had read about a tribe called the Soninke or Zenga, who are called a warlike, even brutalized people. I would like to know if you think any of them resemble you.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want the film to go as far as it did in your own book,\" Chabrol said with a smile, \"because I believe in giving the audience as much as possible to choose themselves. Not too many people in your book, and not too many people in the movie, right?\"\n\n\"You are such an artist!\" Michel", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "First and foremost: I, the author of this piece, don't care whether or not you believe what I have to say. This is not a post about my views on the Israel-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East, although, of course, these may in part shape them. It is about my views on a certain type of discourse about Israel, especially when it involves the language and imagery of Israel, like it or not.\n\nYou see, there's this common tendency among Jews and non-Jews alike: I think that, when it comes to matters of Israel and Palestine, people are far more willing to engage with the subject of the conflict as \"Israel-phobia\" or \"anti-Semitism,\" even if they themselves don't actually subscribe to the view that such a thing is a thing that exists in history and exists today.\n\nThis has always struck me as somewhat ironic, because to suggest that \"anti-Semitism\" is not, itself, an invention of the 19th or 20th centuries -- I mean, isn't that, historically, kind of the norm, or at least that common perception of history? -- seems somewhat strange to me. That's because, honestly, I know that there are people from my generation, who, as I write this, are actually about to be celebrating the sesquicentennial of the Balfour Declaration (the declaration that laid out the principles that led to the creation of the modern nation and Jewish state as two separate countries, or, put another way, two countries -- but never mind!) who, despite the rhetoric of anti-Semitism itself -- the fact that it claims to have been perpetrated by Jews in the 19th Century, despite the fact that it was perpetrated by the British government and not by Jews -- still seem to feel confident that their anti-Semite friends are mistaken about who was really responsible for anti-Semitism, despite the actual historical record supporting that fact. If I'm not mistaken, these individuals have never had the opportunity to read the historical record about the \"anti-Semitism\" that was perpetrated against the Jews in pre-Balfour times, where anti-Semitism was defined as the hatred and prejudice against Jews and Judaism as an exclusive religion, all of it by definition anti-Semitic. (Some anti-Semitism was also perpetrated by the Jews, as I discuss below in this post.) These people can only learn about such histories from actual writings that were actually conducted by historians and not merely from what history books -- and history documentaries -- have told, because without those kinds of records there would be no way to be sure with certainty that such anti-Semitism was indeed committed by Jews and that this phenomenon is, in all probability, an artifact of an already existing discourse about \"Jew-hatred\" and \"Anti-Semitism.\"\n\nNow, it's worth noting that I don't see this as exclusively a European phenomenon. If this were solely a European phenomenon, then I would be more inclined to conclude that Europeans are more prone to engage in anti-Semitic discourse today. However, I would also concede that this is not exclusively a European phenomenon, as is also exemplified by their use of the \"Zionist\" term \"Zionism,\" which is also associated with and used by European Jews. I am not arguing one way or another on that issue.\n\nAnd, to put it bluntly: I am anti-Zionist.\n\nI have always felt that the Zionist movement -- the movement that led to the establishment of the modern state and statehood for Israel in 1948 (among other things) -- is a movement that bears many traits and tendencies that are not exclusive to Israeli citizens. One major reason is because in the words of Israel Hagedorn, the founder of the modern Jewish National Home government of Israel:\n\nThe aim was to create an independent Jewish state and the only possible way to do that was to ensure the existence of a majority-Jewish state in its own lands. The Zionist movement was therefore essentially an attempt of the Jewish people to ensure the creation of their own state. Zionism was therefore the creation of a people with common interests and common origins that would struggle together for their own state. This aim was not an ideology, but the aim was to create a people with an identity.\n\nAt the very least, it makes this movement not just about Israel and Israel as a part of the Jewish people, but also about the Jewish people as a whole. What's more, it also helps to differentiate the Zionist movement from other movements that had similar aims for another country, but which, I would argue, in fact are not similar. In Israel, Zionism is the attempt to create an independent state by ensuring that the majority of the people living in the land of Israel will be Jewish. (And, although not as well-known, the reason that I think the establishment and ongoing presence of the Israeli state are \"part of the Jewish people\" is due to Zionism, specifically to the Zionist people.)

{"text": "Most of the Rhine's current course was not under the direct influence of Roman rule, but it was influenced both by the Romans themselves, and by the tribes to which their soldiers were attached. A legionary commander who lived or fought within the Rhine province or in Germania would have had a particular responsibility for the protection of the river. His role was to maintain the integrity of the frontier, and to prevent the river from drying up (and, if in the hands of the Romans, allowing them to occupy the disputed lands). The legions also had to maintain law and order in their own frontier regions and prevent local tribesmen from encroaching on it. These were often the tribes who, in ancient times, were regarded as the first line of defence against Roman expansion.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of the Roman army after their defeat in Germania Superior (in 410–411 and under the Emperor Honorius in 476), an independent, local dynasty called the Franks established a strong hold on the Rhine River. However, the Franks had a good reason for being at odds with the Roman authorities in the area they were occupying. First, they were Germans, and by definition, were not Roman citizens. Their king, Charles the Simple, fought in the Battle of Adrianople in 378, in which the Romans were defeated and forced to seek permission to re-establish their authority over German territory. This was granted under the name of emperor Valens, and was met with open hostility towards Roman authority in the region by the Franks. However, the Romans were not able to prevent the German tribes from rebelling and attempting to regain their independence against the Romans, and for the first time within living memory the Romans had control over most of Germania.\n\nThe early years of the Fifth Punic War (264–241 BC) were the most violent period of all that had ever been recorded in history. Both sides used terror tactics to win their armies round the battlefields. The victory of the Gallic army at the Battle of Tegea in 269 was almost a total victory for the Romans, but the battle had been won with much bloodshed, and eventually the Gauls were driven home from their positions of victory.\n\nThere was also an international aspect to the war which had more to do with the struggle between the powerful Rome and Carthage. The Romans had decided to take on the power of the Greek city of Alexandria, by sending an expeditionary force to defend it. Whilst this was happening, the Greeks launched a war of conquest against the Carthians in Africa, supported in their war by Romans. This resulted in the destruction of Carthage in the Battle of Himera in 241 BC (although it was rebuilt two decades later, both by the Romans and Carthaginians). The war between the Romans and Greeks finished off with the capture of Carthage in 146 BC and the end of the Greek world, with the Romans taking control of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAfter their victory over the Romans in the fifth Punic War, the Greeks withdrew from the sea areas west of Carthage and founded an empire centred on the Ionian island of Chios (which grew to encompass most of mainland Greece), and the city of Athens was established. The Romans were still able to control their Empire from their naval dominance in the Mediterranean, with the conquest and conversion of Carthage and the end of the Carthaginian Empire in 146 BC. The battle at Cannae was the final great engagement of the war between the Roman and the Carthaginian Empires.\n\nThis was a period of time that saw the downfall of the republic of Athens, which had lasted for around 472 years. The Greek cities of Italy, such as Etruria, Romagna and Latium, were dominated by the Romans, but also controlled by other forces such as the barbarians. This period started in 212 BC, when the Romans occupied Italy and defeated the last of the Greek resistance. After this, the Romans conquered and absorbed the tribes of the northern Italian peninsula for around 70 years, culminating in Emperor Augustus' conquest of Rome in 29 BC (in the year 30 BC) and the establishment of the Roman Empire.\n\nDuring this time a Roman Empire had been established and the Roman language was still used in a significant way. This allowed Romans to make important contributions to science and literature, which would have otherwise not be possible. For example, Cicero was the first known Roman to write and record the philosophy of Epicurus. However, there was a problem because of the use of the Latin language, with the inability of Roman soldiers to speak Greek. They therefore had to live using an approximation of Greek which was known as Latin. For example, Julius Caesar ordered his soldiers to use the Latin form of address in frontend to their commander and Caesar's soldiers. Other Latin words, such as those used to describe money (aditus) or to describe the military (expeditus) remained in the words in use by the Romans themselves until the 16th century.\n\nFor a number of years", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "In the Philippines, the private sector has been a major engine of economic growth. This has been apparent for some time as the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Philippines expanded at an average rate of 4.4 percent from 1993 until the end of 2002. At that time, the total economy of the Philippines was projected to rise to 2.7 trillion pesos. The following table provides a summary of that growth.\n\nThe size of the economy at various dates\n\n1/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2002\n\n2/\n\nThe Philippines at the end of 2003\n\n3/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2004\n\n4/\n\nThe Philippines at the end of 2005\n\n5/\n\nThe Philippines at the end of 2006\n\n6/\n\nThe Philippines at the end of 2007\n\n7/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2008\n\n8/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2009\n\n9/\n\nThe Philippine economy at the end of 2010\n\nFrom these data, one can observe that the Philippines economy grew slowly from 2003 until 2008. This was due to the relatively low GDP growth rate for 2003. This slow growth was due to the fact that the country experienced economic shocks from 2004 to 2006 and from 2008 to 2009 through the aftermath of the crisis in the Middle East.\n\nIt is important to note that between 2001 and 2005, the Philippines experienced an economic shock with the collapse of the Philippine peso. This contraction had a huge economic impact since the collapse of the peso was the first to reach the level of the equivalent of 9% GDP growth. After the devaluation of the peso led to an economic shock in October 2005, GDP grew between 2004 and 2006. This showed that the economy is resilient to shocks.\n\nEconomic shocks\n\nThe first shock came in the form of the collapse of the Philippine Peso in 2003. The economy of the Philippines experienced a GDP decline of 3.2% of GDP. During this phase, the economy was hit by a number of cyclical factors.\n\nOne of the major events that led to this crisis was the slowdown of a number of countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and South Africa. Inflation in the Philippines was also at an extremely high rate during this period reaching 10.4 percent by year 2009. These economic shocks came out of nowhere. They are not related to the crisis in the Middle East.\n\nFigure 5 shows the Philippine economic data for 1997-2005. The following table shows the cumulative impact of the country's economic shocks on GDP. This would show the extent of the impact on real GDP from the economy of the Philippines.\n\nFigure 5\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nThe above graph indicates that the effect of the above-mentioned economic shocks has been cumulative. This has been evident for the following reasons. During the period of 1997 to 2004, the Philippines experienced an economic shock with low GDP growth rate. After the economic shock of 1998, the Philippines economy experienced lower growth until 2004. After the 2007 economic shock, the Philippines experienced a surge in growth after reaching a high point in 2007. The graph shows how economic shocks have been able to recover after the economic shocks and are still capable of recovering even when the economic shocks have not ceased.\n\nAfter the economic shocks, the growth rate grew in 2006 and 2007. This was due to the good weather in 2006.\n\nOne of the major measures used by the Philippine government to stimulate the economy is the stimulus program. This is one of the areas for future research. Since most of the economy of the country is agricultural, future development should focus on this type of industry.\n\nThe government should take into account that economic shocks affect not only the government but the private sector as well. This is due to the fact that people would often take measures to deal with economic shocks. This is due to the fact that people take measures based on their own beliefs and assumptions.\n\nIn response to many challenges, the Philippines economy is resilient and has become a major market to export many goods. For example, on average, every year 4.3 goods exported by the Philippines are to countries in the Middle East. This is in spite of the fact that during the above mentioned period, the Philippines economy experienced many economic shocks.\n\nIn spite of the above, other challenges were experienced during the 1990s. One of them was about the role of the government in the economy. The government was still considered a major contributor into the economy.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government reduced the role of the private sector in the economy. Before the economic crisis of debt, the private sector had been the main contributor to economic growth. A number of policies were introduced by the government that sought to limit the role of the private sector in the economy.\n\nIn summary above, the challenges experienced during the 1990s showed that the government's role was still a major contributor to", "label": "gptneo"}

They are quite expensive though, and if Apple is trying to keep costs down the last to enter will probably be the cheapest.\n\nSo when will it be time to switch to Apple products as opposed to the Android products?\n\nI would have assumed you would have written that article for PC Mag instead of this blog, especially without links to your own work.\n\nI think Apple’s focus this year was going to be on iWoz, and that was the reason why they have cut off from PC Mag. I think when the iPhone is released it will be an iPhone 8 or a better yet iPhone X, and Apple would focus to get as good a piece of hardware out on launch day as they can get.\n\nThen will it be the iPhone 8, iPhone X, or an iPhone 8s with bigger screen and then a iPhone X? I would like to have an iPhone X but I don’t want to carry around something that large. That is why the i9 4K is the best option for me.\n\nYou know that at this point I’m a fan of the small tablet. But when the iPhone X comes out in a few months, then you’ll see all the big companies fighting over who will have the most and biggest iPhone in a single device.\n\nI got a look at your article on the iPad Pro. If they continue with iPad Pro, with the 4K screen, then the iPad Pro would get pretty hard-core competition from the iPad Pro with Retina display. And the latter could eat away at the small iPad Pro in all aspects.\n\nI don’t think we are at the point of the screen size war in smartphones, as we are having with tablets. There are currently 3 different sizes, at least 2 of which are 4K screens. The one thing that I don’t like about the “S” size tablet is the lack of ports.

{"text": "This movie was terrible. The plot was terrible and unbelievable. So bad that even a person like me (who was on the fence about it) and who is not normally a \"jerk\" still gives it 1.5 star rating out of ten.\n\nI thought the plot was going to be \"bad\" because the actors where trying to kill themselves off as much as possible, but when we find out the actual plot of the movie, I could say that it was one of the few movies that ever had a good and bad part. The bad came in when the movie tried to be too perfect, and the \"good\" part came when the movie turned out too realistic (which was a relief for me and a lot of other die hard horror fans). The movie had lots of special effects and was really different from what we are used to see nowadays, it felt like an actual, real horror movie. I mean, the whole movie did not have blood, it didn't have a dead body at the end. There was only one blood splat, and then the movie ended. Although, when I say the horror was realistic, I mean the movie was really realistic in how it was acting. The acting was absolutely terrible, and when the actors tried to make it realistic, it was the opposite of the movie's good part. I thought it would be funny to imagine a scene where the characters died because of \"real\" horror of it, which it was a horror movie about. I have never seen a more horrifying movie on TV or on the big screen. I thought it was one of the worst movies I did see. At least it's on Netflix now.\n\nNo one dies because of the evil of the characters or the storyline, the characters died because of real horrors. The movie is about one group of three college people (that was the characters) that suddenly got scared of a haunted house, and they came together to clean it and it didn't turn out the way they expected. The acting made me cringe, too much \"action\" shots.\n\nI loved the movie and it is now on Netflix but I'm still madly hoping that there was a TV version like the last movie that I saw - Evil Dead remake - that I could have seen.\n\nAs a great movie based on three young people trying to do the same thing in an eerie house, it was disappointing. I really wanted to know why everything turned out ok for the four characters despite the fact that it should have made them all dead. I wanted to see what happened to them. I hope there is a sequel. I only saw it online last night.\n\nI gave the film 3 stars because overall I found it very suspenseful and I really liked the look of it with the blood and gore but the ending to it was horrible; the ending for me killed the whole atmosphere of the movie in the blink of an eye (it really did)\n\nthis is a really, really scary movie. i actually was scared when i watched this movie (it's not one of the scariest movies i've watched, it's not like The Strangers in the beginning but i have seen that movie and was scared, so i'm glad it made an impression on me lol )\n\nnot a gore site and not a scary site, but this movie does scare the shit out of you. i actually thought about leaving after about a minute because it had a bad end i just couldn't make it through the movie without having my heart beating like crazy, crying a lot, and in short i just couldn't sit there for too long. i also thought about leaving after watching this as well but i had to force myself to stick it out. i actually am surprised this movie made me feel scared because i thought it would be very different from any movie i've seen so far but even though it was different i did have the same reaction when i watched it. maybe its because it's not super scary or too easy to fall asleep to or maybe its because i'm an adrenaline junkie like everyone elses and i'm used to watching things that scares me... but this movie is the bomb from top to bottom. a scary movie, a thriller like movie, and an intense horror movie at the same time. the movie actually has some good acting, like the cast, and they had some chemistry together, which is unusual, some were the same from one scene to the other, some didn't change their performance at all from scene to scene, and some were just one scene from scene. the movie was well paced, and had some really interesting ideas, especially the plot, a haunted house movie i would call it. it really had a completely different idea then anything else i've ever seen and it really felt good to watch. it was actually really sad to me but it also had a really great message, which is what i found scary about it. it has a similar message to horror and horror movies because it's about being scared and not being able to help", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "the matrix element of a bound electron interacting with the scalar $\\sigma$ and vector $\\omega$ mesons and its projection onto the nuclear system. After a proper transformation to the atomic orbital basis representation for the target (the nucleons), the matrix elements can be written in a form which can be readily used for the calculation of reaction cross sections following the Glauber approximation.\n\nWe consider only the scattering of a single projectilelike electron by a single target like nucleus without any background to which the electron can be scattered (for the scattering by the vacuum electrons of light nuclei we refer the reader to Refs. [@Griko64; @Glauber2]). The elastic scattering at $T=300$ keV is already a reasonably well-known cross section, while the experimental error ranges from a few percent to one or two in cases when the projectile particle (electron in this case) is a nucleus (electrons in this case are electrons). When we want to calculate the cross section for the scattering of an electron with the nucleus the effect of the background potential must be included. The simplest way to do this is to take into account the contribution of the virtual states to the electron scattering amplitude in the form of the scattering states $|M\\rangle,|N\\rangle,...$. Note that since in our situation scattering by an electron is essentially elastic there is no contribution from the excited state $|N,{T_T\\!\\! =\\!\\! T \\! - \\! E_C\\!\\! =\\!\\! 300 \\mathrm{\\ }} \\rangle$ (or $|T\\rangle$ which is the ground state of the target atom) to the total cross section. Since it is known that excited state corrections in the elastic electron scattering to the total cross section are small (less than a few percent), we take for the elastic scattering cross section $\\sigma_0(T)= \\langle N,0|V_{el}|N;T;0\\rangle $ [@Zhukov] as the zero energy value of the elastic scattering cross section, which can be well approximated by an effective local potential at the distance of a $^{56}Fe$ nucleus located at the origin $r_0$ from the electron. The form of this potential $\\hat{V}_{el}$ used for the $^{56}Mn$ and $^{208}Pb$ cases is shown in Fig. \\[fig:potential\\]. We take into consideration that both targets $^{56}$Fe and $^{208}$Pb have charge numbers between $N=58$ and $N=114$ (and therefore their nuclear charge distribution is symmetrical) with the volume V=$R^3$. For the calculation presented in this paper the volume $V=R^3$ of an atom in its ground state $|\\mathrm{A,vac,T=0 \\rangle}$ and its radius R=$\\langle N,0|r|N,0 \\rangle^\\frac{3}{2} $ have been used. The potential used for the other nuclei is symmetrical. The form of the potential can be easily derived from the radial Schr$\\ddot{\\mathrm{o}}$dinger equation: $$\\hat{H}_{el} \\cdot \\psi= E \\psi.\n \\label{Schr3}$$ where the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{el}= -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I^2} \\nabla^2 \\, +\\, \\frac{\\hbar^2 g^2}{4I^2\\mathcal{A}R^3} [\\l\\frac{r^2}{R^2}+\\l\\frac{3}{R^2}\\r].$ and the eigenfunctions of the one electron Hamiltonian $$\\fl \n \\hspace{-0.5cm}   \\psi(\\vec{r};T)= \\sum_{m,n} a_{mn} Y_{mn}(\\pi,\\sigma) Y_\\zeta,\n \\hspace*{10mm} \\langle\\mathrm{n,e}\\r|\\psi^\\dagger_{m=0n}\\l}=a_{m=0n}\\sqrt{\\pi},\n \\label{Z_M0n}$$ where $Y_\\zeta$ is the spherical harmonics for the azimuthal quantum number $\\zeta=0,1,2,...$, $Y_{mn}(\\pi,\\sigma)$ is", "label": "gptneo"}

The ccd observations of a 20 deg$^{2}$ region of the Galactic center in the observation band of 0.2 - 10keV (about 30ks) were performed for two consecutive orbits with the EPIC camera in small window mode (1/4 CCD) and one of the nine cameras with a large window mode (3/4 CCD), as shown in Figure 1, where a source named 1 corresponds to the CXB position (Figure 17).\n\n![Observation of the Galactic center region in *XMM-Newton* field by “XSCD” mode [@xmcd_data] []{data-label=\"fig:image_ob\"}](figures/fig3.eps)\n\n![A schematic view of the observations of the Galactic center region by the ccd imaging.

A more detailed description of the reduction procedures for all data used in this work is given in a previous paper [@xmath0_paper]. We followed the standard analysis to produce an image in the 0.2 - 10 keV band for our sources, and a light curve with a binning of 1000 s in each observation. Figure 3 shows all the obtained light curves. The errors due to Poisson statistics were estimated to be on the order of 0.04$\\%$ in the 0.2 - 10keV band, so we can safely consider a detection is a statistically meaningful [@xmcd_data].\n\nAs a result, a number of faint X-ray sources were observed in the Galactic center region in the 0.2-10keV band and the ccd photometric results were compared with those obtained in the ccd imaging mode, which were presented in previous papers [@xmath0_1; @xmath0_2; @xmath0_3]. In those previous papers, the sources were assumed to be point sources without any correction, so the resulting photometry (hereafter referred to as 0.2-10keV) was less accurate than those by the ccd imaging (hereafter referred to as 0.2-10keV).\n\nOur result of one such faint source is listed in Table 4 together with its ccd photometry result from the ccd imaging, which is denoted as CCDIMAGE. The difference between the ccd photometry and that from the ccd imaging is discussed in several previous papers. [@xmath0_1] and [@xmath0_2] claimed the photometry by the ccd imaging is about 0.2-0.5 and 0.2-0.8 times more accurate, respectively, which was partly based on the large error caused by the pile-up effect. [@xmath0_3] argued that because the pile-up effect is not observed in the ccd imaging, ccd photometry should be used instead of ccd imaging in order to avoid possible overestimation.\n\n[c c c]{} X-ray & &\\\n& CCD & ccd\\\n\n& & 1-sigma\\\n\n\\\n& & 1-sigma\\\n\n\\\n& &\\\n\n& &\\\n& &\\\n\n\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n& &\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n[lrrr]{}\n\n$f_{1,20000(1/2)}$0.03 (8.0) $\\pm$ $0.13$ & 3.0 & $0.1-2.0$ & $0.8$\\\n$f_{1,12000(1/2)}$0.05 (6.8) $\\pm$ $0.18$ & 1.0 & $0.2-2.0$ & $0.5$\\\n$f_{1,9000(1/2)}$0.04 (5.8)", "label": "gptneo"}

It didn't have a good script.\nI watched it in a two hour span and by the time\nit was over and I was done watching it, it really just\nfelt like the writers just said, \"I don't care anymore\nand I'm just gonna make this whole movie suck.\"\nI mean, in theory, it was a bad movie, but I'm glad I\ndid.

{"text": "any spacetime containing a degenerate killing horizon, such as a black hole, it is believed that this ‘topological’ nature persists at late times, but it is a matter of debate whether it survives to the formation of the singularity itself. For a more recent review of this subject see [@s1]. A review covering the topic from the viewpoint of general relativity and asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes can be found in [@s2] whereas [@s3] gives a somewhat different viewpoint from the asymptotically flat background.\n\nThere are many reasons to conjecture that the apparent degeneracy of Killing horizons might be replaced by a discrete set of solutions characterized by the nature of their degenerate Killing horizons and their spacelike degeneracies; in particular by a discrete set of the first homotopy group for which $\\Pi_1(\\mathcal{H}) \\approx \\{ 1,h,h^2 \\}$ [@st2]. This conjecture and the related conjecture regarding different topological interpretations for degenerate Killing horizons have sparked a lot of discussion in the physics literature. The basic idea is that if one considers the spacetime as a 3-manifold it will have a topological structure that can always be decomposed uniquely into 3 distincts connected components, one topologically equivalent to a 2-sphere, and the other two topologically equivalent to balls which are topologically equivalent to 2-tori. This argument has been used in the context of gravitational topology in different contexts and has proved to be a fruitful starting point for such conjectures in (e.g.) Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory and string theory[@w2]. However in the context of vacuum Einsteinian gravity with positive cosmological constant it is questionable to assume that the spacetime can be uniquely decomposed into topologically distinct subregions and there is no obvious argument to prove or disprove any conjecture such as given above. In the context of the vacuum Einstein theory it has been argued, that the Killing vectors of the degenerate solutions might have a similar topological character to those of their static counterparts [@kimball], a characterization that is independent of the particular choice of vacuum solution. A similar analysis has been performed in [@barrow], where it was argued that the Killing vectors of the degenerate Killing horizons might not have a topological origin, but might correspond to what is known as the ‘topological’ symmetries of the spacetime, an argument that is not valid in general, however, for vacuum solutions. It might be noted here, that the issue of topological degeneracy of Killing horizons and their continuous character seems to have no impact whatsoever on the possibility of existence of black hole solutions with a non-constant curvature[@abh] and for this reason the continuous degeneracy has mostly been ignored in the literature devoted to such issues.\n\nA detailed understanding of the role played by the continuous degeneracy (or otherwise) of the Killing horizons in the context of spacetime singularities would not only be very helpful in understanding the role played by continuous degeneracy in the early universe as well as in the context of the black hole remnant formation but it would also have very interesting consequences in cosmology as well as in any other theoretical description of the late time universe that attempts to explain the present behavior of the universe on a more general basis, i.e. considering all solutions with non-constant curvature. The existence and uniqueness of the horizon-crossing time in the context of black hole evaporation has also been a source of important questions in the literature. These issues have been studied extensively for the Schwarzschild black hole and they have been addressed both via the use of analytical solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations on a de Sitter or anti-de Sitter background [@b1; @b1; @b2] and numerically in a large variety of spacetimes [@a1; @a2; @a3; @b3]. In a recent work [@b4] the possibility of avoiding horizon or event horizons was considered by considering spacetimes with topologically trivial boundary. While it is easy to show that such a solution does not exist, the authors in [@l] were the first to attempt to show the uniqueness of the black hole horizon. Since our spacetime is asymptotically anti-de Sitter this solution seems to be a natural extension of the one presented in [@b4]. We would like to point out that the present paper does not deal with the uniqueness of black hole horizon. The issues regarding boundary conditions at the singularity have already been discussed extensively in [@b5] and these issues have not been considered here. We will not dwell into the issues regarding the uniqueness of the horizon for our spacetime. As is well known, uniqueness of the black hole horizon is", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where you start, scratch your head, then wonder what the Hell did all of the fuss and all of the marketing BS add up to? It's a good little movie, in its own way, an odd little movie with a lot of great ideas for other films, but ultimately, I've lost interest in it. Like The Thing from Another World.\n\nThe Thing, from the book by a guy named Stuart Gordon:\n\nI was only the third producer and it was my first film, but I'm gonna say 'Thing' because that's what it was, the Thing, in The Thing from Another World. I was very pleased with the script. It had some great ideas in it. And I decided to take another run at it with my next film. I had originally titled It Came from Outer Space, so I took it to United Artists. They loved it, which was great because they needed to make one to test the waters. And even at that time, I thought they should do it as a thriller. You wouldn't be able to put the idea about a meteor landinin on Earth in a horror, thriller kinda movie. They made the call for 'a sci-flick.'\n\nAnd then, I did It Came from Outer Space and it was okay. I made my second picture, and I thought I was sorta in a'sophomore slump' at United Artists. And for some reason, they picked This Island Earth, in which I made a deal with the studio to do one thing and one thing only. I put the idea of a man being sucked into a wormhole in, and in came The Thing. I thought to myself, 'This one is going to be a success, for the same reasons as It Came from Outer Space.' In fact, I still believe that to this day. But instead of a man being sucked into a wormhole, this movie had the wormhole being sucked towards the Earth, so it was almost a science fiction version of a horror feature. I thought that would be a nice way to finish the job, and I thought the'sophomore slump' would be over. And the end result would be a sci-fi horror feature that nobody would talk about. But it turned out to be the death trap that it was. It was 'The Thing' that nobody talked about.\n\nYou'll notice my first two movies are all, apparently, all part of an experiment where the studios were buying up all of the ideas and then letting me do them under their names. But that experiment was an epic failure that continues in all of my subsequent films from then on. It wasn't until my third movie, which was done from scratch, that any success actually came back to me thanks to a deal with United Artists, and The Thing was the first film under my name. But it was a failure that started me down a career of being the only man involved in all of those films.\n\nAnyway, back to This Island Earth, which in reality I was only in on a deal for another $1,000,000, since I'd had to rewrite, and because the script was so bad, you had to wonder what else wasn't written by the guy. It's called An Island Earth, and it's a travelogue around a foreign world, sort of like Planet of the Apes, with one difference; they had already shot most of the action. It began with Jack Benny playing the head of the studio, and in that, it seems like the only person around him is a couple of German scientists. Anyway, Benny starts off by describing the new kind of sci-fi picture they're about to launch, and I think he's referring to the movie that has a scientist being sucked into a wormhole.\n\nBut they're not sure how to do it. And suddenly, the head of the studio walks in, looks at the movie set up, and says, 'What the hell are they gonna shoot us in here?' And then, the idea came up that he had the head of a meteor, and could he have the head of a wormhole? And then he went into further detail, how could he have the head of a wormhole, but have his own head in the shape of a meteor, so he wouldn't have to wear any helmets while performing all of his actions? Then, I thought of the way the meteor was about to strike the planet.\n\n'I'm no engineer,' he said. 'But, I'm sure I can build a suit that would fit him perfectly.'\n\nOne of the German scientists, a Mr Wachter, says, 'Well, if we can just give him a suit that looks like a human being wearing a human head.'\n\nSo he goes and gets the human head off a scientist, a man named Schick, whom he thought was dead, but then wasn't.

{"text": "This film took me by surprise. I make it a rule never to look at a man’s chest, but at about the halfway point the film got to the place where we were supposed to see him chest, and we did. I looked down then immediately began to worry because the script called for either his eyes, or chest with or without makeup, all depending on the scene, and he never did seem to get to a shot without someone looking down on his chest. In a moment of complete panic I looked him in the eye and he was staring down at my chest.\n\nThere really are no rules when it comes to art and film. So the next day, when the crew got here and I got on set I looked for him a few moments and made sure he was ok. I thought maybe this was just an elaborate ploy by the script, or perhaps the director felt that it would only endear him to the viewer. So, the next day I decided to check him for myself by going up to him, to see if he were ok or not, and was met with nothing other then someone staring down, so I gave up. We took a walk around and I decided to go back to work.\n\nThe film was amazing and for a time it seemed that this was what the American film scene should be. Every single shot was just so so. Like, I have never in my life seen an actor with a gun pointed at him, and as a person that has experienced a range of violence from a family member to a stranger I was blown away. In the final analysis, the film did not stand on this amazing score and did not take the amazing scenes of shooting and editing. But the scene of shooting himself, which was also done on screen, was great. I will not spoil it because it is one of my favorites in the film (along with the scene just before it in which the actors play themselves acting out the script), but let us just say it was an incredibly great scene. He is just dead set in a dead set shot of his chest. You can hear the audience gasping throughout the course of the shot. It is not easy to make the audience gasp. His shirt is pulled down by a belt, and the gun is pressed to his left nipple. It is just the most powerful thing to look at. The actor playing himself, Mark Salling is just simply superb. It is a great scene for him to make.\n\nI will say that the film had a lot of problems. Firstly, let me explain how you can think of every flaw in a narrative film. The first problem is that the storyline is not strong enough. By the time it reached the story telling point it was already at the end point and we were given a recap. Which I will tell you is not the same as the introduction to every plot you would see, and that is what they had to do.\n\nThe recap was very weak and so much information just got left out. For instance, there are moments of great dialogue and great music in the film, but they are not shown, and we go from this point to the end in an hour. It should have taken us about a half hour. To show more people what had happened. I wish I had a transcript for you guys, because I had to take many trips to the bathroom during that half hour alone, to vomit and go to my room with the windows open because I would just throw up on the bed. It was terrible. I will say that once we left the first time in the theater I told myself that yes, we should make it on home video, but I did not and then I watched it at home and thought: Why do I think we have to show the film in its entirety in this version?\n\nAnd there is another flaw. In essence it tells a story of a lot of women who are being hunted after taking a small amount of a drug that is being used as a sleeping aid. It was a cheap drug until the early 90s. There was no such thing as a female version of the drug, but that does not deter the film from telling a women’s story. But there was no explanation for why this woman is trying to find people that have done this drug, until we get to this part of the film. In essence, the film is just this woman telling this woman how the drugs is being used to sleep, and then the story continues right after. This was not explained at all.\n\nThe film is very fast. It is shot on film, in 8’ 2’ 3’. And for some reason, I don’t even know what this can have to do with whether it is good or not, but I feel compelled to say it. The film is shot in such a way as to have a very fast shutter speed. We are so used to actors having a look of the film in the editing room which would be slowed to 1.5", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "Manchester Royal Infirmary staff placed Neville Tyldesley alone in a wheelchair for a week in December 2013. In the early 1990s, the ward of the hospital had special needs patients.\n\n“I could hear the doctors banging around and thought, 'This is what I want. There won't be many patients out here. The staff won't be here',” said Tyldesley, who has severe diabetes and was bed-bound.\n\nHe eventually became the hospital's only person able to use a toilet – at which point he was removed from the wheelchair by a “friend” dressed in full NHS uniform.\n\nThe hospital's former manager Michael Green says that while it is not true to say staff were only present in the area to provide basic care – on his part he is confident that the only patients cared for by the hospital at the time he was in the room would have been in the “very advanced stages of dementia, multiple sclerosis and other disabling conditions”.\n\nAccording to the hospital's patient records there were 24 visits to the room – for different patients – during that week, totalling just under 18 hours.\n\nWhen the hospital's director of care, Michael Leishman, was asked in his evidence to the Royal Commission on Medical and Health Care Learning whether he had accepted that medical carers on staff at time are often working up to 100 hours a week – rather than just the hours officially listed – he said this was the best he could do.\n\n“The truth is this: I was told at the time that we are working very intensively – a lot of weekends,” Leishman told the inquiry – but added he \"couldn't tell you how many hours you have out of each day\".\n\nHe said hospital management was also being supported by his management team when they were “looking for solutions that may help”.\n\nUnder cross-examination by barrister John McVeigh, chief lawyer of the Commission, Leishman agreed that staff were on duty during regular and irregular hours, but said: “It could have been a very few times a week, it could have been a very few hours a week, but I can't answer for that.”\n\nThe inquiry was told that, although he had agreed this, Leishman did not know how much other staff were working overtime.\n\nWhile the inquiry was not told the exact number of staff working at night or weekends, on the morning before he had left the room, his management team discussed having a full-time duty doctor at the Royal Infirmary – to provide continuity in care, by giving emergency care as and when required.\n\nLeishman said they had considered adding staff on an ad hoc basis, but had realised doing this at the Royal Infirmary would risk the hospital not having sufficient doctors.\n\nThe inquiry also heard that Leishman said at the time: \"I could not possibly say how many doctors we have. We have a medical staff of 25, 25 part- time doctors, and 20 doctors in the Royal College of General Practitioners, and we do not have enough doctors or nurses.\"\n\n\n\nA doctor is seen in a medical scrubs and cap during a media tour of the Royal Hospital of which the director of care was awarded the MBE in the 2015 New Year Honours List.\n\nIn the opening statement of his evidence Leishman said staff were on duty at night, and staff were involved in out-of-hours care when the hospital was under a code of conduct for staff under the Mental Health Act 1984.\n\nWhen asked whether he understood there was no official policy on the number of people working nights or weekends, it was his recollection “that was probably what had been agreed up-stairs”.\n\n\n\nThe inquiry continues at 8.30am on Wednesday October 11.", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between the actors, suggesting that they were from an earlier generation. They were never really given a chance in the show as we know it; many of them were simply too old or too “unworthy” to get a spot.\n\nBut I personally don’t know anything about the producers, writers, directors, etc. who made up the program they wanted or wanted to create: I was too young to have watched the program to be truly aware of the people behind the set. The reality shows of the day, reality films, or other “reality” based-programs of the day was all created by the producers/writers/directors based on their personal vision, and the people on the set did not have a say in who, what, why they were chosen to appear on the show.\n\nBut based on the fact the casting call was “not quite right” as far as the actors concerned, I believe all the programs we have in television today, are actually the best version the producers/writers/directors wanted of them.\n\nSo, based on my theory of the case as shown by this comment from a previous post, I believe that any show that has the cast on it, is almost always trying to be something the audience and producers actually wanted it from the beginning but didn’t know or could not control for one reason or another.\n\nSome would consider this theory as stupid, but I would rather suggest it as a possible possibility. So, as to whether or not the casting on “American Idol” was right or wrong, I’d say it definitely wasn’t! But, based on the fact that the producers/writers/directors knew who they wanted from the show to be on the show because they had talked to the cast previously, it makes a lot more sense in my mind.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nI guess the show is a step up from any other reality show with contestants, as all the people they auditioned were the people they’d want on the show.\n\nAnd I think as a viewer, I don’t blame the participants for being on the show, if you know that you’re not going to be chosen for the show because you won’t be a “good enough” singer, and then you have to go out and audition for the show…to put themselves out for another chance of becoming one of the many “unworthy” people to perform during the audition round. They needed to do it to become on the show, so they did it, and now that they’ve done it, they can relax on why they came and performed, and really focus on the task they chose to take on, whether it be musical or just singing, the task was not to audition for the show..that’s why they were brought on the show in the first place.\n\nBut it really sucks when you know in your heart that the casting call for the show was not right, but you still get chosen for it because of the chance you had or the casting directors wanted you on the show. That’s a huge waste. In addition to the wasted talent in the casting call…which in my opinion, they should have had no choice but to cast the audition round, as I am sure even the most qualified participant would be unable to put up a better show than he performed with.\n\nIn my eyes, there was just not enough time during the audition rounds of the show so the producers/writers/directors could get to know each auditionee and give the cast every chance, but then had to stop it because they figured out who auditionee was going to be eliminated. That was really sad. But, at the very least, a different outcome would have been if they had done the audition rounds the right way.\n\nNow that I’ve seen the show, and that I’ve talked with the producers/writers/directors about it, I totally get why they had the wrong casting call for the show. The show really made a difference for only about 5 people auditioned and chose to move on to the live round. The others, they had already chosen their final fate in their minds before the show because the casting call was “not quite right.”\n\nBut it really, really sucks when you know in your heart that the casting call was right for you, but they still chose you no matter what. I mean, at the very beginning of the show, all 5 of the participants thought they were really going to be on the show because they believed they were the best singers and the other contestants would know that, too. Unfortunately due to someone, some one(s) got fooled in the casting call and they all went on the show no matter what at first. And then you look at the show", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "Planetary geologists have measured different abundances of oxygen isotopes in the atmosphere of Mars. If Mars had a thick atmosphere (in some cases the thickest in our Solar System’s history), it would have been a world rich in water. But it would have been dry, probably because of the strong greenhouse effect it experiences. Now the Earth is suffering from climate change, which may or may not be a result of greenhouse warming. We may suffer the consequences soon.\n\nBut climate change did not happen only on Earth—it happened also to Venus, at least in their last few years, according to the study of Mars and Venus published in the journal Science. Venus does not have a thick atmosphere and doesn’t show the “greenhouse warming” that Mars does. But it does have an extremely dense atmosphere. Could that atmosphere account for the “greenhouse effect” of Mars, when it came into contact with, and absorbed, more than the usual amount of water gas, creating a greenhouse effect, as well as warming the planet and the atmosphere?\n\nVenus is the closest planet in our Solar System from another planet, the Earth, and most people are familiar with its surface, climate and even the weather. We have only the one planet to talk about, right? There are other planets for the Earth to think about.\n\nWhat is “climate science?” It is a science that studies climate, weather and the climate cycle, or climate patterns. This is not “climate-changing science.” It is different because it looks at the natural phenomenon, and not climate scientists create or modify it.\n\nAccording to a NASA story by Paul Hawken, one of the world’s greatest advocates for reducing environmental degradation, climate scientists can look at this natural phenomenon and point to what is happening and why.\n\nHawken, the president of Earthworks, founded the Global Business Coalition on Climate Change and has been quoted as saying in a Washington Post article:\n\nClimate change is going to happen whether or not we like it. It’s just a question of how much it hurts and damages the things we value. … The only certainty I see is that if the climate changes in a way that endangers the environment we’re going to be on the receiving end of this change. All those numbers, in other words, are based on climate science.\n\nIs climate science that reliable?\n\nClimate scientists have been involved in the research of the greenhouse effect for some time.\n\nHawken says:\n\nThe climate scientists at NASA have contributed to some key experiments showing that without greenhouse warming it would rain less on the earth. … The key test for the greenhouse effect is whether there is a warming effect on the earth’s atmosphere. We’ve said repeatedly that the best way to measure the greenhouse effect is to measure how a greenhouse affects the earth’s temperature. There are many experiments showing that greenhouse warming raises the temperature of the earth’s atmosphere. … There are also experiments showing that without more greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, the earth would be colder.\n\nClimate scientists have measured different abundances of oxygen isotopes in the atmosphere of Mars. There is much larger amount of water there than on Earth, and Mars would have been a lush world, filled with water and vegetation.\n\nYet Mars’ atmosphere, according to the study of Mars and Venus, is about one-sixth as dense as Earth’s atmosphere, one-third as dense as Titan’s atmosphere, about half as dense as Mars’ atmosphere, and no heavier than the atmosphere of Venus. (The average density of Venus’ atmosphere and the atmosphere of Titan is less than that of Mars).\n\nA question that comes to our minds is, “How many layers would Venus have?” And then:\n\nAnswering that question requires a detailed model of Venus’ atmosphere as a function of altitude and density. To answer it we first need to know a few fundamental conditions that exist in the Venusian atmosphere. To estimate what layers would exist in Venus’ atmosphere it is necessary to make an educated guess as to what the atmosphere might be to start with and we cannot do that very accurately … It should be obvious that it would be impossible to determine the relative composition of the Venusian atmosphere without knowing the density and temperature profile of the gas in question.\n\nVenus’ atmosphere has a temperature of about 450 kelvins, and a density of about 0.9 g/cc. So the first layer, Venus’ atmosphere’s first layer, is about 20 percent hotter than the surrounding air (450 kelvins is 1,250 degrees F). And the next layer is the first layer of density just below the first layer. So the next layer below the first layer of about 7,000 m/s of air is a layer with temperature of about 450K and density", "label": "gptneo"}

He has also only kept two clean sheets for the club in that time, when he was in charge; he took charge for the first time in 2006, so perhaps the expectation of Villa becoming title contenders has come a little too early for manager Smith, particularly as the team looks to be in for a relegation battle this time next month.\n\nWolves\n\nDean Smith is keen to build a new-look squad, following the sale of three players, and has already strengthened the midfield with Scott Malone, and with three new arrivals in Aaron McLean, Gary Hooper and Danny Batth, the Wolves boss is hoping they can challenge for the next decade.\n\nSmith has already added a creative forward, which he was in favour of, in Danny Batth; he wants to take a more attacking approach with the team to try and get back to Europe following their disastrous season so far.

Patients had a baseline eye examination with digital fundus photography and a comprehensive ophthalmological exam by masked raters. The primary outcome measure was presence of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy was defined as 1 of the following: a baseline eye with microaneurysm, venous beading, fibrous cap nonattachment, hard exudates and clinically significant exudative retinopathy (i.e. those patients exhibiting intraretinal microvascular changes but without new hemorrhages, new retinal neovascularization, or clinical retinal detachment). Of the 636 diabetic patients with recent-onset diabetes mellitus, 317 (53.6%, 95% confidence interval, 50.8-56.5) had diabetic retinopathy. Patients with diabetic retinopathy had a higher mean (SE) age (56.0 [0.9] versus 60.2 [0.5] years; P < 0.001), were less often white, male, and married; more reported a history of smoking (26.6% versus 14.5%; P = 0.006); and were more likely to have chronic lung disease, an active infection involving the eye, recent stroke, a history of high blood pressure, and a history of major depressive disorder and/or other psychiatric diagnosis. Patients with diabetes mellitus have a high prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, a more aggressive and more disabling form of diabetic retinopathy.", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "The principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks forming over long periods of time through the deposition of sediments, the rock contains a range of mineral assemblages, the composition and relative proportions of which affect the mechanical properties of the rock. The principle of inclusions and components has been a focus of interest in geochemical research due to its key role in understanding and predicting the mechanisms of transport of minerals and other rock-forming elements through the crust. Inclusions are present in the form of small minerals or, more complex and typically are less than 0.5 mm (μm) in size, whilst components are present at the nano (0.5–100 nm) and cm (100–10 m) scales. Many modern inclusions and components are complex organic molecules from the organisms that built and inhabited the sediments that formed them, for example, fossils. Inclusions and components are of major interest given their key role in providing constraints on geological and paleontological processes and in modelling sediment transport and other physical processes in the subsurface ([@R11], [@R12]).\n\nMany geological bodies in the Earth such as, ophiolites, mantle plumes, and metasediments possess inclusions, especially those formed by fossilized sediments. These inclusions are especially valuable when geologists study the fossil record, as are many minerals and rocks from the continental crust, such as, gabbros, granites, limestones, dolomites, schists and quartzites ([@R5]; [@R1]; [@R6]). The mineral assemblage and composition of fossiliferous sedimentary rocks from the carbonate platform of Nankai Trough, Japan can be particularly informative in understanding geological processes. Previous studies using SEM and petrography have noted distinctive morphologies of fossil inclusions, for example, angular ([@R12]), ellipsoidal ([@R13]), oval, round and cylindrical ([@R14]), and also of fossil components, for example, organic remains ([@R2]).\n\nThe aim of this work was to document the mineral phases that were present in the Cretaceous rocks of Nankai Trough of western Japan. The focus is on the mineral assemblages within inclusions (the inclusions themselves are not described in this paper). Previous studies by our team have identified the mineral phases of several of these minerals, which have been analysed using both X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and electron microscopy (EM) ([@R3]--[@R5]). In some cases, the mineral phases have been shown to have their origin in inorganic components ([@R3]). In the case of the iron-pyritic mica group, we have identified the mineral phases of the anorthoclase, orthoclase and olivine types ([@R4]). However, we have also documented the absence of the mineral of the phlogopite type in some specimens, and that of the zingite type in some others. The mineral phases of the iron-pyritic mica group are rarely found in inclusions, however, this does not detract from the importance of these minerals to geological interpretation as, we believe, their mineralogy has been heavily influenced by the inclusions they have been cemented into, which can cause significant changes in their morphologies ([@R13]). The results here describe the mineral composition and relative proportions of the mineral phases that were identified in the Nankai Trough inclusions, which has been a focus of previous studies of this region to improve our understanding of the geological processes and processes involved in the processes that underlie geological processes (see, for example, [@R10]; [@R7]).\n\nThe Nankai Trough sits within the Japan Trench in the East Pacific Rise of the Southern Alps of western Japan, located between the Japanese islands of Hokkaido and Honshu (Fig. [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Its geological origin lies at the eastern edge of the East Pacific Rise (or East Japan Trench) region of the East Pacific Rise ([@R8]). The geological history of Nankai Trough is a relatively young geological feature, with the majority of the rocks forming within the southernmost portion of this region deposited from \\~1 to \\~5 ma, following the formation of Japan during the Cretaceous (\\~140 to \\~110 Ma), with a few younger rocks deposited within the same period on the inner edge of the East Japan Trench, forming the North Kanto Basin. During this period, the central part of Japan moved to the western edge of the East Japan Trench, along the North Kyushu Trench and ultimately northwards into the Central Honshu Basin ([@R8]; [@R11]). During this phase, rocks from the Nankai Trough can clearly be identified by the lack of major", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "constant temperature molecular dynamics simulations were used to study solutions of sodium alginate oligomers formed by the cross-linking of two sodium alginate molecules. The oligomers formed by a high-molecular-weight sodium alginate have a high concentration of low-molecular-weight soluble oligomers and a lower concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers. We observed the formation of alginate network in aqueous solutions, when the system is kept at a high temperature (80°C) for 15 minutes. After the first period of the network formation (for 15--35 minutes) the concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomer is small and increases exponentially, while the concentration of low-concentration small soluble oligomers has a linear function to time. Then, the high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers reach a stationary value, which means that alginate networks are formed and the average diameter of the formed networks is 2 μm. This time of formation is in agreement with available reports \\[[@pone.0204961.ref013], [@pone.0204961.ref022]--[@pone.0204961.ref024]\\]. The network formation (formation of soluble alginate oligomers) is a dynamic process and depends on the temperature and the water-entropic nature of the alginate solution. When the system is cooled, the concentration of soluble low-molecular-weight oligomers increases exponentially, while the concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers increases linearly \\[[@pone.0204961.ref010]\\]. This process is known as the re-entrapment of the low-molecular-weight soluble oligomers \\[[@pone.0204961.ref025]\\]. The presence of the soluble and insoluble alginate oligomers can affect the properties of the formed network with a negative impact on the gel strength (due to the swelling of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers). Additionally, because of a better solubilization of the large alginate oligomers during the formation of stable network, it is important to form stable networks during the synthesis time, when large amounts of re-entrapment of the low-molecular-weight soluble oligomers occurs. The system of re-entrapment of the large soluble oligomers occurs when the temperature is increased; such process can reduce or eliminate the formation of the insoluble oligomer aggregates and can help the formation of a stable network of alginate \\[[@pone.0204961.ref015]\\]. Formation of alginate networks by the cross-linking of two sodium alginate molecules has other advantages, first, since the networks have a large surface area (it can absorb many of the water molecules), second, these networks have a good mechanical property which makes them better for biomedical coating (as they are made of alginate, they can be used as injectable hydrogel or are insoluble to degradation by chemical substances such as ethanol \\[[@pone.0204961.ref016]\\]. It was shown that formation of alginate network by the cross-linking of sodium alginate with sodium citrate in organic solvents yields films with the lowest compression modulus, which is the reason for the use of such a preparation method in biomedical applications \\[[@pone.0204961.ref013]\\].\n\nThe results showed that at 80°C, a stable alginate network was formed between the cross-linked sodium alginate oligomers. The diameter of the formed alginate network was approximately 2 μm. In the case of sodium alginate with a high concentration, and at 90°C, an extremely dynamic process was observed: the concentration of soluble low-molecular-weight oligomers was greater than the concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers. At the same conditions and temperature, the concentration of the soluble low-molecular-weight oligomers was greater, at times, was equal to the concentration of the high-molecular-weight oligomers. An exponential increase in the concentration of soluble low-molecular-weight oligomers was observed at 80 and 90°C, while the concentration of high-molecular-weight insoluble oligomers remained constant.\n\nIn other words, in both cases (80°C for 15 min and 90°C for 15 minutes) the concentration of the high-content of alginate oligomers increases after a decrease, after 15 minutes of the alginate polymerization; these changes in osmotic pressure can occur in the liquid phase and thus can affect the physical parameters of the alginate solution.

{"text": "the nature of dark matter is one of the outstanding unsolved problems in modern physics. There seems no simple answer as to the question of whether dark matter is composed or not of any material substance, or even if it is composed at all. All attempts to make dark matter particles from elementary particles are expected to fail when confronted with the problem of quantum field theory on non-interacting particles. Therefore, they are not expected to provide useful information about its properties, such as the energy density and the pressure, and hence the total matter content and the equation of state (see Ref. [@wmap] for experimental information). At some point some new physics may come up, which could lead to the understanding of dark matter. An example of such new physics is the weak-scale supersymmetry, see for example Refs. [@super].\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems unlikely that we can reach the point to establish the theory of dark matter. Therefore, one must consider alternative hypotheses for its nature. For instance, one can postulate the existence of non-baryonic stars composed mostly of cold atomic nuclei [@nuclei]. Moreover, dark matter may be realized as some form of cold weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or, alternatively, as a modification of baryonic matter such as non-relativistic fermionic dark matter [@fDM] or bosonic weakly interacting massive particles [@BosDM].\n\nDespite the different hypothesis for the nature of the dark matter particles, all such theories must describe the data released so far with a common dark matter mass.\n\nAnother possibility for the nature of dark matter particles is the existence of exotic or supersymmetric particles [@extrad]. However, in general, all the ideas discussed above are based on a theory of dark matter. The main difference between these theories and the standard model concerns dark matter density. In particular, for supersymmetric and extended models, the present dark matter density is not predicted [@extrad].\n\nConclusions\n===========\n\nCosmology is a relatively new field that gives us an unique opportunity to use some very powerful theories related to particle physics for understanding fundamental laws of our Universe.\n\nFirst, we have considered the big bang model, which has been considered for the analysis of big bang nucleosynthesis, nucleosynthesis and galaxy formation. We started from the assumption that matter had the properties of an ideal gas at extremely high temperatures or ultra-relativistic conditions, then we derived the main assumptions necessary to reconstruct the initial conditions of the Universe, as well as the temperature and pressure conditions that are required for big bang nucleosynthesis and the formation of the hot big-bang galaxies. In addition, we also considered the problem of dark matter.\n\nWe suggested three possible types of dark matter, weakly, non-covariant or non-covariant-nonhomogeneous. The main characteristic for all types of dark matter is their nature as dark matter. We focused on the non-mimetic scenario and in particular considered the cosine form. We presented observational effects of such a form, and in particular we discussed how cosmological observations can distinguish a cosine form of dark matter from a cosmological constant dark energy. We also proposed two more types that could account for dark matter.\n\nWe discussed some cosmological problems related to the dark matter, such as the question of how to explain the large-scale structure of the Universe and how to explain the small-scale effects in the early universe. Also, we looked briefly at some alternative proposals for dark matter and discussed their cosmological potential.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that we would like the reader to take time to go to the website <http://home.weizmann.ac.il/xavier.marcoso/matematicas.html> to find out more information about the papers of this series.\n\n[99]{} J.

{"text": "Diabetes Type 3—which is regarded as \"brain\" specific diabetes—is a combination of three disorders: (a) type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas and liver cannot effectively secrete insulin (also referred to as insulin resistance); (b) a deficiency of insulin production in the brain, which then produces high levels of insulin, or hypoglycemia; * * *. If it is the first symptom, it is called Type 1 diabetes; and if it is the only symptom, it is called Type 2 diabetes. Since you have Type 1 Diabetes, you have high blood glucose in the blood * * *. Also the blood glucose that is taken by your brain is called brain diabetes. * * * If you have insulin, your blood glucose goes up * * *. It also goes down. If you don't have insulin, it goes up * * *\n\nWhy is type 3 a concern?\n\nIn Type 3A diabetes as a \"specific complication of the type 2 diabetes,\" the pancreas produces less of insulin than it used to. As insulin is produced with less concentration, insulin and sugar (glucose) are released together. When that happens, the type 3A forms: * * * A. the hypoglycemic pattern that causes short of breath and weakness that progresses to collapse and coma. Patients have a rapid drop in the blood glucose level, with severe and dangerous drops in blood pressure. * * * B. in the brain, resulting in memory changes, mood swings and a rapid decline in mental capacity. * * *\n\nIn Type 3B, the patient has a relative increase in blood sugar. This means the blood glucose tends to rise even with meals. To a certain extent, we can prevent that by taking insulin, but that is not a complete solution—especially in an elderly patient, who can be sensitive to the blood sugar changes. However, the most important thing is to decrease the sugar concentration the brain has with our meals.\n\nWhy is the risk from type 3 the concern for Type 2?\n\nThe diabetes risk for Type 2 does not depend on the insulin concentration in the blood; if one's pancreas produces less insulin, then an increase in the sugar levels occurs, as happens in the type 2 diabetes. * * * If you live with Type 2 diabetes, you can prevent the occurrence of a hypoglycemic event by eating the right meal: eat the meal when you are hungry. Also, don't drink water with an hour or two of no-food times in the afternoon or morning. Also, have a snack after dinner; eat a snack every two to three hours between meals. * * *\n\nWhat's the \"lifestyle change\" that the patient will be required to make?\n\nThe lifestyle changes that we need to make involve not only insulin and diet, but also changes in sleeping, exercise, smoking and alcohol use. The changes are shown in the lifestyle profile for Type 2 diabetes (Figure 25-6). The patient also has to learn to self-manage his own health, as mentioned earlier. * * * If you are diabetic, you can't eat food that contains too much carbohydrate, or you can't exercise at high intensity at least one of three days per week. * * * It's difficult to find other changes that you can make. * * *\n\nWhat are the risk factors for heart disease in Type 2 diabetes?\n\nThe following are coronary risk factors for the long-term risk of heart disease in Type 2 diabetes:\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nAge\n\nBody mass index\n\nBlood pressure\n\nBlood glucose before the age of 40 years (A1C in adults)\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nFigure 25-5 shows the lifestyle change plans for the type 2 person who is 65 or over (B) and 75 or over (C). In addition, the lifestyle change plans for an individual between 30 and 60, with high A1C (no less than = 5.7 for women and 6.5 for men) (D), and 30 to 65 with average A1C (no less than = 5.0 for women and 5.4 for men) (E).\n\n**Figure 25-6.** The lifestyle changes for Type 2 diabetes. _Source:_ Diabetes Health Education and Prevention Center, Kaiser Permanente Washington, DC.\n\nThe total points for the patient shown in Figure 25-6 are: A. 65 years and over: 24.

{"text": "A dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh on November 3, 1996.\n\nTranscription by John DeJean\n\n(Please click on the speaker notes underneath for a longer version of the transcript.)\n\nThich Nhat Hanh: Welcome. Thank you for this presentation. I am very happy to hear from you these last few years because my time as a Buddhist monk was much too short. I do come from a Buddhist background, but have long known and revered the traditions, precepts, and teachings of many different teachers and teachers.\n\nSo I am very happy.\n\nBuddhism is a very personal and spiritual tradition and is most definitely still quite young. Most of the time we are in touch with our teachers, and most of us know our lineage, but this is only for a few years of our lives, a few decades at the most.\n\nIt is in this context that I give you what I think are the main lines of my teachings given in the first four volumes of “The Middle Way,” which are in four parts.\n\n“At that time the Buddha gave these four discourses. They comprise both a series of teachings, and the foundation, from which one could derive any knowledge.\n\nWith regard to the discourses on the Buddha’s way, how he taught his disciples the ultimate truth and how those teachings could be transformed so that their application will become a means of attaining liberation.\n\nWith regard to the discourses on the Four Noble Truths, how the Four Noble Truths could be realized in any way. Then with regard to the Discourse on the Path.\n\nHow the Path could be realized, and how those practices and paths can help us transform our habits and mental formations, and make life more meaningful and more productive.”\n\n“The Discourse on the Buddha’s Way of teaching can be divided into the parts it begins with. The first part, which concerns the nature of the mind and the nature of mind states.\n\nThe second part, which concerns impermanence, and the three marks of existence. Then what follows concerns the path, how it can be developed, how it can be transformed, how to attain the goal of liberation, how to lead the way to liberation. The end of the middle way is the wisdom that arises through wisdom.\n\nThen what follows are two discourses on the Four Noble Truths. These teachings are all, one sees, extremely short. They have been taken from the First Turning and are presented in four categories, because there are four aspects of the teachings. The first set of four goes through the teachings of a number of teachers. The second set of four then shows the four truths in the light of a number of traditions.\n\nThe last set of four deals with the end of the Four Noble Truths, the wisdom that arises at the end of this whole process of transformation, which is the final wisdom.”\n\n“The Four Noble Truths,” which were presented in this way, first were presented as an eight-fold way of understanding.\n\nThere was also a further four-fold way, which was presented in terms of the four “dharmas.”\n\nSo there is no need to translate these teachings. These four noble truths and the Four Noble Truths, the four aspects of the Four Noble Truths, can be translated as follows:\n\n1. Mind is empty. It contains the seed of the seedlessness of the mind.\n\n2. Mind can be developed in various ways, and these are also called “dharmas.”\n\n3. Mind can also be destroyed. It also contains the seed of destruction of the mind.\n\n4. Mind can be purified. Its root is the seed of its own destruction.\n\n“We look at life from our own point of view, as it were. We see things as beautiful or ugly. Or as good or bad. Or as bright or dark. Or as small or large.\n\nWe see things as beautiful or ugly.\n\nAnd it would be better if we viewed things from this way—the Way of viewing things.”\n\n“As it were, just as I see this tree in front of me with a hole inside, the branch on this tree, and the branches that grow on the branches of this tree and these stems—this has something empty inside. The branch is empty. That is not the branch.\n\nAnd this is the branch, and this branch is empty. And the branch on the tree is empty. And the whole tree, the whole branch of the tree, the whole stem of the tree, the whole branches of the tree, and the whole stems of the tree. That is empty.\n\nThen I look at this—that is empty—as it were on this tree", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "This movie took me by surprise. The opening credit sequence, which I still see whenever the credits roll, featured what felt like a scene from James Bond. An arm holding a box of money in the air as it is thrown from the window of the moving vehicle (the camera’s downward movement, then up and back to re-position the box in the frame, is also reminiscent of a Bond car chase). The shot of the box falling towards the ground, at the very beginning of the movie itself, felt like something out of one of Bond’s films, which I guess goes along with the theme.\n\nHowever, when the movie starts, what I found most surprising was the plot and how it was executed. It’s not very long, but the story is well crafted, and the acting is amazing. The film itself could have easily passed for a classic, but the director has put a lot of effort into building the storyline, so you’re invested in the whole thing. Even the title of the film is clever: The Other Ones. The film is set in the future (about 5,000 years in the future), but also involves the time frame in which John Connor (Jared Leto) is born.\n\nThe plot is about what happens when the first group of humans (the ones that make up the main cast) arrive in what they call the “City of Light” (the term coined by Leto’s character) and the second group of humans goes in the “City of Dark,” which is something completely different. Because Leto is biracial, he also has a strong connection to both worlds (his character is the “Other,” the one who is a mix of “White” and “Black” in nature, and is therefore a mixture of “White” and “Black” with only a few shades separated for the purposes of the story). Leto’s character (“John Connor”) is a man with amazing abilities, but he is not normal. In the words of his love-interest (“Anna”), who is also a character from the Future of the series, “No one can see his true gifts.”\n\nLeto’s character is not normal because of the way that his heart is a pure love for a beautiful, dark-haired woman. I won’t say her name here, but she might as well be called “Catherine.”\n\nThis man is a very unique and special being and if you thought he was ordinary, the movie’s main character will blow your mind. So how did it all happen? I was really surprised by the story and the acting, but not the technical aspects of the film. It was quite a fun ride in a very interesting plot, and I hope it lives on past its initial run. It’s a very unique and compelling world, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.\n\nLogan (Hugh Jackman) was brought to the future to be trained by an artificial intelligence for his “special task” to be a father. He’s going to teach his son about the world in which they live, what humans know and what does they don’t know. We know that this is a family business because of all the time they spend apart for their jobs at “MakoTech,” the corporation that is responsible for training all human children for their “jobs.”\n\nI was a bit skeptical about the futuristic aspect of the movie because to me, it seems a bit out dated. However, the movie does not just throw some of the tropes that were prevalent in the “Matrix” and “Terminator” (at the time of their releases) from the past over the fence and into the future, it uses them to tell a very different plot. The futuristic aspect of the film actually has quite a bit of weight to it, to put it simply.\n\nFirst, it is necessary to define the three main characters, Logan (Hugh Jackman), Kate Austen (Kate Mara), and their company (the film’s title is a nod to the popular book “The City of Light,” but I won’t go into it here). This is not your typical family drama. I am a bit biased when I say this, but I find all human stories a bit one sided and not very realistic (I always think of the old “Saggy Pants” cartoon). You know, when an action scene begins in a shot before it even starts? That’s a good representation of family drama. Like my parents always said to me, “Let me tell you a little story.” Now I am just going to steal that and say my parents always told me a story, they", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "The average Mongol garrison family of the Yuan dynasty seems to have had a relatively low income. In 1598, one of the best scholars in Europe at the age of forty-seven was appointed as an official for the Ming court in Hangzhou. The position of military official, one of the most prestigious and lucrative posts, entailed a high salary and the requirement to give a year-long salary to the governor. The average salary for a member of a Mongol garrison family of that era ranged from 3,200 yuan to 2,500 yuan per year. The salary for a middle-class man would have been 1,600 yuan, less than half of that for a member of the ruling elite of the dynasty. Moreover, the Mongol garrison was an army of horsemen with few weapons and no armour. The soldiers in the garrison would have been trained as horsemen, but without the military discipline that would have been required at the fighting frontier for the Qing army at that time.\n\nAlthough an official position held by a military man was an important promotion, most of the families of the garrison would not have had enough money to support an heir. In order to get a son to join the army, families of the garrison would have to go through a long process of succession. All family members would have been required to serve as soldiers for twelve years and to contribute one year's wages on the basis of merits or family connections for each year of service. However, the government did not impose the requirement for all the sons to make contributions into the family. Only some family members would be required to give a year's wages to the government. This led to a large number of peasant children of the families of garrison stationed in the Mongolian army. During this time, with no prospects of an economic rise in the next generation, many children would be forced to work in the army. They would have been trained in the basics of military service and in fighting with lances in their father's hands.\n\nAs for the education of the youth at the age of fifteen, it would seem that the Mongol garrison did not have much to offer young people, who received either primary or common education in elementary school, and who were expected to learn martial skills to serve one's country. During the period up to the end of the Yuan dynasty, there were no Mongol soldiers who were trained as the most advanced war tactics.\n\n##  **The End of the Yuan Dynasty**\n\nThe Yuan dynasty was established on the basis of Ming dynasty after the reign of the Ming emperor Hongzhi (1271–1336). The emperor Hongzhi attempted to extend his power from Beijing to other territories through military intervention and negotiation with other local rulers. This was the time when many peasants were becoming increasingly discontent with the poor economic conditions and poor welfare of the Mongol garrison.\n\nAccording to some historians, the rebellion of the Hongwu emperor (1723–1740) and that of the Jianwen emperor (1735–1735) were provoked by the harsh conditions of the garrison soldiers; while on the other hand, the Ming emperor Kangxi (1722–1796) regarded the garrison soldiers as his best soldiers in his campaign against the revolts of the rebel Xuande and the rebel Hongshi emperor.\n\nWhen the last Yuan emperor died in 1763, he did not designate any successor. Although after his death in 1763 there had some Mongol garrison troops in different regentships, the Mongol troops stayed in their barracks. Some of them even received land titles as a reward for their military service to the Mongol government. During the early period after the death of the emperor Wanli (1762–1799), there were frequent attempts to assassinate the new emperor Kangxi, but the efforts were not fulfilled.\n\n##  **The Beginning of the Qing Dynasty**\n\nThe reign of the last emperor Wanli (1762–1799) was a period of great changes in Chinese history. Under these conditions, the Qing dynasty, with an entirely different administrative structure, came into being. The Mongol garrison, after being a part of the Chinese imperial army, no longer had any interest in serving in the Qing army. They continued to serve their local garrison towns and became the main force of local government of their towns. Under the supervision of the Qing court at that time, in an attempt to get some benefit from the former Mings, many young Mings from the Mongol garrison in Qing lands have founded new Mings. The main reasons for the decline in the Chinese power were that since the last emperor, the Ming dynasty has declined in territory and it was too weak to defend itself effectively against the invasions of the Japanese and the Mongol Empire. The last Ming emperor Yang Xiu (1641–1721) was succeeded by his grandchild Hongwu in the last period, and Hongwu not only had a strong interest in building and strengthening his China's ancient imperial traditions, but also had an imperial title.

These are characterised by low job security of a fluctuating nature, high pressure in terms of time management, and high degree of job insecurity, especially for part-time workers. The highest numbers of employees in the two sectors are found in the agri-food sector and are often part-time, as are also the low numbers of workers in the transport and logistics sector.\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and fishing constitute the largest share of jobs in the Rhine Valley area (41% and 43%, respectively), which is somewhat lower than the national average (47%). This is partly due to the low density of workers from the non-agriculture sectors.\n\nThe vast majority (65%) of jobs in the Rhine Valley area are in permanent or long-term contracts, slightly less than the national average of 77%. Approximately 25% of the workers were not employed through a contract, and 35% worked on a temporary basis, with more than a third of the temporary workers in the agri-food sector.\n\nThe share of temporary contracts in the Rhine Valley area was lower than the national average, while the number of part-time contracts was higher.\n\nThe majority of the people employed in the Rhine Valley area are young people (51–73 years old).

{"text": "The Australian, 24 June, 2016One of the two people telling Mr. Trump in an exclusive interview that he owed his celebrity success to Russian help was Vlad Tadic, the son of Vladimir Kara-Murza, a retired Russian spy who, in the 1990s, had helped U.S. security against what seemed to have been Russian hacking. Mr. Putin denied having anything to do with Mr. Trump’s rise, but he did say that Mr. Trump’s business activities had brought economic benefits. He praised Mr. Trump as a strong and reliable leader. “His personality is always in an active state... he gets excited about anything,” Mr. Putin said of Mr. Trump. “He’s a genius, a visionary.” Mr. Tadic told the Australian that American intelligence officials had told him that Mr. Trump had “great friends on the inside” in Russia. “He made the decision to join the government of Russia as the head of American intelligence, and I am convinced Russia gave the Donald Trump that opportunity,” Mr. Tadic said.\n\nThe Australian, 28 June, 2016On Sunday, May 16, 2016, senior intelligence officials in Washington told Trump staffers that Russian hackers were trying to influence the American election. The officials claimed the Kremlin was trying to help Mr. Trump, according to a person who was part of the chain of communications from the officials to Mr. Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn. Mr. Cohn met one of the senior officials at an all-hands meeting at the Trump Organization the day after Mr. Trump’s first foreign visitor, Sergei Roldugin, the Russian ambassador to the United States, called Mr. Trump a man of integrity who is in contact with Russians. Mr. Roldugin was the first foreigner to meet President-elect Mr. Trump at his New York apartment building, and he was accompanied by a senior lawyer from the Kremlin, who handed him a business card with the name Moscow Prosecutor’s Office on it. Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his top political adviser, were initially puzzled over what the card could possibly mean. Mr. Trump told his staff in the evening, “We have to find out very clearly whether or not there was any collusion between the Russians and my campaign. Because that appeared to be the most concerning thing in all of it,” according to one of the aides, who asked not to be quoted by name. Two days after the advisers gathered, the same Trump staffer received an email from a senior Russian official, who said that Mr. Trump would have much success with Russia on the election, and that Mr. Trump should consider starting a new business in Moscow. The staffer didn’t understand the email at first, and passed it up to the White House, the senior Russian official said. “It was a one-line email,” said one senior Russian official. “A lot of information is contained on this sheet and he wanted me to pass it to Jared, from our point of view, as is usual.” Several intelligence officials say they believe that the Russian government was the main force behind the hacking aimed at Mr. Trump that was first revealed earlier this year, and that Mr. Trump’s advisers and Mr. Flynn were surprised when they found out about it only the night before the Election. One senior intelligence official said Russia’s goal had been to support its favored candidate, Hillary Clinton, who was running against Bernie Sanders. “I can’t believe the people who are saying that Trump was wiretapped by the Obama administration,” the official said. “But I guess it’s possible.” The officials described the Russian effort to influence the election as a covert operation, in which the Russians would plant software on computers, or hack into their networks, and would use it on behalf of one candidate or another. They acknowledge that the hacking had potentially damaging effects on the election, but do not think Russia was ultimately responsible for it.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have determined that there was strong enough evidence from the start of the campaign that it was being affected by Russian hackers to take extraordinary steps to prevent that hacking from having any effect. There have been several attempts to assess the origin and scope of the Russian hacking, but by May 2016, the United States was able to share its findings with allied governments, a senior government official in Australia’s spy agency said. On that basis, Mr. Obama decided that the evidence was compelling enough and unprecedented in its scope to warrant the extraordinary step of publicly disclosing the U.S. findings about the hacking. Although he declined comment on that point to Reuters, the president said in a statement, “I authorized this as I believe that it is in the national security interest of the United States to disclose publicly the evidence of Russian interference in our upcoming election.”\n\nIn March", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "we investigate the effect of helium abundance and @xmath0-element enhancement on the abundances. In a series of papers [@Keller_2012] developed a new method of determining element abundances based on line strength ratios observed in H$\\beta$, using the data of @Henden_2015. Such a method was applied to the present data by determining a helium abundance of the order of 0.30–0.40 for this galaxy and a \\[C/H\\] factor of 0.30. The use of this method is limited by the need for spectral resolution better than about 0.1 Å and the difficulty in measuring the strength of carbon lines. The method cannot determine abundances below 1.8 $\\leq$ X$_{He}\\leq$ 3.1 for helium, but it can for C and N. This method is very promising for C and N measurements in distant galaxies, as the CII(1593.59 Å) and CIII(2200.75 Å) are observable and sensitive in the optical spectral range, which is important at least for LMC studies. We have used such a method for our target, but the accuracy of the measured He abundance is uncertain.\n\nFigure \\[fig\\_x\\*\\] presents the abundances of C, N, and He (with the He abundance derived with the method described above) as a function of the helium mass fraction, $Y_P$, for a model spectrum for an A4p simulation, using a model spectrum and photoionization models with \\[O/H\\] = 0.3, and \\[C/H\\] = 0.4. The model spectrum includes He and He, the CN lines, and He and He lines. The helium mass fractions of the model $Y_P$ = 40 %, 50 % and 60 % are the same as in the simulation. The figure shows that the carbon abundances are enhanced by about 0.3 dex, which is consistent with the abundance ratio for CN and \\[O/Fe\\]. Carbon abundances are enhanced by 0.35 dex from $Y_P$=50 %. This is larger than the 0.35 dex estimated with the CII(1770.33 Å) by @Cayrel2006. There might be two reasons for this difference. First, the model spectrum considered here does not include carbon stars. Second, our determination of the helium abundance is uncertain. Figure \\[fig\\_x\\*\\] confirms that the carbon abundance is enhanced by almost the same amount from the carbon abundance. The helium mass fraction is enhanced also by approximately 0.05 dex below $Y_P$=40 %, but we see no appreciable enhancement below 60 %, at least it is not obvious in the figure. This result is also in line with the abundance ratio to CN, \\[C/H\\] (Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]). We can say that the observed carbon abundance is 0.35 dex enhanced with respect to the adopted He abundance. This is larger than the abundance ratio for CN with respect to C, \\[O/Ne\\] = 0.1, and \\[C/Na\\] = 0.1 (see Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]) but it is significantly smaller than the carbon abundance enhancement of 1.0 dex of \\[C/O\\] derived by @Kobayashi2000. We are not able here to judge whether they were correct, but it is unlikely to find the nitrogen-enhanced C abundance, such as the nitrogen abundance 0.6 dex for a solar nitrogen abundance [@Asplund2009], from nitrogen enhancement in CN.\n\nThe N/O and Ne/Na ratios and carbon abundance are all more enhanced toward the center, while N/O and Ne/Na have been estimated by @Aoki_2001 to be enhanced with respect to their solar values, while there is no appreciable abundance enhancement of C in the Cepheids. The N/O and Ne/Na ratios are more enhanced toward the center than the C/O ratio (Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]). As a result, the N/O and Ne/Na ratios are more enhanced than the C/O ratio.\n\nIn Paper I, we have already demonstrated that the carbon abundance increases with age and that the \\[C/O\\] ratio is approximately constant. This is not the case for neon and oxygen for LMC Cepheids, as shown in Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]. The oxygen abundance also increases with age. We now see (Figure \\[fig\\_ratio\\]) that the C/O ratio at \\[C/O\\]=0.08 decreases slightly for the first 4.5 Gy with respect to \\[O/O\\]=0.07.

{"text": "purposethe toxicity of antiglaucoma medications to ocular surface cells has been suggested to be due to oxidation/oxidative stress. Oxidation of extracellular matrix proteins by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may cause disruption in the function and structure of the ocular surface thereby impairing the function of the ocular surface. We studied the effect and mechanisms involved of the antiglaucoma medication timolol maleate (TMO) on ocular surface cells induced by cyclo-oxygenase-2 siRNA. Primary human corneal epithelial cells were cultured in the presence of TMO. TMO was added to the cell culture system 24 hours after transfection with a sequence-specific double-stranded siRNA targeting cyclo-oxygenase-2. Cells were harvested at specific time points, and then the amounts of reactive oxygen species were determined using a fluorescein dye. Immunoblot detection of Nox2 protein expression was performed. TMO significantly increased intracellular reactive oxygen species in cyclo-oxygenase-2 siRNA-transfected cells. The reactive oxygen species production was almost completely inhibited by Nox2 siRNA, indicating that oxidation was mediated through Nox2. TMO also caused changes in expression of various components of corneal epithelial cells. The expressions of some corneal epithelial cell proteins were reduced in a similar manner to reactive oxygen species. The effect of TMO was reversed by subsequent addition of Nox2 siRNA into cell cultures. Our findings suggest that oxidation of corneal epithelial cells caused by TMO might be due to increased reactive oxygen species. The effect of oxygen radicals on the cell function depends on which reactive oxygen species is increased during oxidative damage. We propose that the mechanism of the anti-stress effect of TMO involves the inhibition of reactive oxygen species through Nox2 expression, which may also explain the therapeutic effect of TMO on ocular surface cells.", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world's most famous band, ever. The first four notes were enough to put the top musicians of the world on a mental pedestal. Even though they were born at the end of the sixties of last century, Carlos Santana and Stevie Wonder were too old to get away from the record label of his moment in time: Atlantic Records. There were other record labels, other artists, other songs, another planet. But if the records released in that era were compared to this recording, it would not be possible to find a more perfect image for the sound of the era.\n\nThe recordings began with the legendary band that came to dominate the airwaves, starting in Brazil with the record Dooinserto, by Tia Geraldo, who had been trained in her native São Paulo at the conservatory of the Conservatorium and, with the money she received from her recording, bought a tape recorder, and began to record her family in the small town of Campina, São Paulo. Tia Geraldo was very happy to have someone in a position to record the songs that she and her bandmates performed. Since that time, a small number of her songs were released to the world, among which included Ipateu, by Luiz Gonzaga. The song was one of the first with the band, but it was the first album they released. In the eighties, the same group, also in a position to record songs, recorded the same number of hits. It was the first time the two singers could be heard together in the same album and the album did very well for them.\n\nThe first album was also the last one released by the group, which at that time had seven members, and it started to change over the next eight years of the ten years the group spent together. At first, they became friends, but then the friendships shifted into full-fledged relations.\n\nIn 1986, when they recorded the album Dooinserto, they already knew each other for thirty years, since the first contact between them occurred in 1957 when Santana first met Wonder. At that time, it was at the beginning of the eighties, with Santana on the cusp of being able to produce his second album, and Wonder was on the cusp of being able to release the first of his albums. In those years, Wonder was going through a difficult period that he shared with Carlos Santana. Between 1986 and 1990, the group released seven records. The great success recorded on Dooinserto took Wonder to another level and the group recorded at a higher volume.\n\nCarlos Santana was the first to recognize it in himself. Before the song of Dooinserto, Santana sang as if he was singing with just one voice between two instruments. Even after his amazing success on Dooinserto and the albums he recorded thereafter, he would always have moments of silence during the songs, only for one or two notes to appear from the end of the song to the beginning again, and this is what happened to his voice on some of the records that followed.\n\nAfter the massive success of Dooinserto, Wonder, in those years, had a personal success that was also personal, and he released a new album. It was a collection of all his hit songs. The first album he released posthumously had a song that no one had ever heard before, and was the song of what was to be the next big hit, \"Alibi\", with Bibi, one of the female members of Santana's band.\n\nAs I was saying, Wonder was the first to recognize in himself the quality of the work produced by the group. He realized that the next one was going to be even greater. The next album, released in 1990, was very successful, reaching platinum status in the United States. In Brazil the album was named Supernova, and for three years. However, Wonder's career seemed to be about to end and his manager, Ed King, who had never stopped trying to get Wonder to make a new album, wanted to keep him with a small group that he already had. After the first album, the band had seven members, and after one year of working with only five of the members, it seemed that only one would continue to be part of the band.\n\nThe other members had their difficulties to deal with, too. There was the feeling that, whatever they did, things were going to turn down the hill, and Santana finally stopped working with the band. On the same year, the great group he founded to support Wonder began to record songs that they recorded for the first time. Wonder's song became the first single, \"The Way You Rock Me\", by The Fugees, and also it was the title on their album, which quickly became a hit, the album selling over twenty million cds in the US alone", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "The incongruous sight greeted shoppers at Ringwood Market in Hampshire. A man made from Lego and wearing an oversized Superman t-shirt strode on to the stage, arms outstretched.\n\n'Sorry, what did you say?' I asked as soon as I arrived. 'Can't get reception there – the reception's up the hill. There's no one there.'\n\n'But I can get reception here,' he whimpers, pulling back his arm. 'I'm the only thing there!'\n\nI looked up at the tower and wondered why the people building it hadn't considered the people on the hill before building it. We are all equal on the hill.\n\nAs I continued along the hill in one direction, I was met by the sound of a fire engine in the other. It was all rather odd, and my instincts kicked in to tell me this was not a good look. There was still light enough to see by.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, I got the courage to call the station on my cellphone. I had been thinking about ringing the police so I had left the house fully expecting to put up my alarm to take over the task of getting me home. That was until the light on my cellphone went out. I was able to say the last four numbers of my cellphone into the phone. I managed to give the officers in charge the whole of my address – but I didn't want to tell them any other information. The officers were a bit surprised when I explained. They said that in two or three days time they would be getting round to it. I assured them that would be all right but in the meantime I thought I would ask for a bit longer than two days. They agreed, and said they would have it in their notes. They thanked me for making the call and wished me luck before I took off back down into the village.\n\nIt was now well after midnight. I started walking – it was getting dark earlier now. I walked down the road until I came round to the front of the Tesco store. I took my own groceries home in my car. They were for my mother who was in hospital.\n\n_**Sunday, 11 May, 10th Floor, Tesco:**_ I went to the Tesco store when I came back home to pick up my groceries – they were all still at the checkout and I had to be in my office before the staff knew that I was on my way back. I thought I had left my phone in work.\n\nWhen I arrived back in my office I opened up my email and then looked at it again. I thought there had been an email from my wife and then I remembered hearing her phone ring and thinking she was waiting for me to pick it up so I left my office and went back to grab hold of my phone. I saw that I had three texts from her and it wasn't even one of them from her.\n\nI hadn't thought about those texts in the car home. I had put the keys in the ignition thinking that it wasn't going to happen. Once I arrived home I was in too much of a hurry to start the car. I walked back into the house to find my phone in one of my coat pockets. My mother was in hospital – that's the phone call I hadn't made in the first place – in fact, I had not even thought about it and as far as I knew I left my phone in my office on my desk – I was already in the wrong. I looked at the time on the email. 9:40. I was late – I had got to the point in my day where I couldn't believe what everyone was telling me was true. My wife knew I didn't have my phone, at least she thought I didn't. She knew I had left it in work. She could sense my depression. I had a big mountain of emails on my desk that I was going to end up with. She had a theory that I had been with a girl. I'd been going through hell. As I stood there holding the phone I saw she had looked at the time of her calls and realized she had called me at eleven o'clock and that it was only four. In a way, the thing that had struck her with was I hadn't answered. She saw me go back into my office and open the desk drawer and she thought I had gone to get the key to my office. I was in agony. I had spent my Saturday night at home. I couldn't face going back into work, it was all I could think about. I went to the bedroom and took out a bottle of wine and went back in to my office. The door shut out the light but I switched on my laptop on the bed and I was using the bottle to see if the emails would come through. My boss was having a party at the end of the week.

{"text": "Dirk Hoekstra's newly refitted boat, which once belonged to his sister, is parked in the marina, which makes it hard for me to leave. I walk out to the water's edge with a bag full of old clothes, the kind made of material like terry cloth, which I think I will return to the seamstresses on my return. Then I decide I will hitch south and head back to Amsterdam. Hoekstra will never stop looking at me, and it is hard to leave him. But I am starting to wish my journey had been longer.\n\nHoekstra stands at the stern and waves at me, his hands on his hips, his red sneakers a little unsteady against the hard gray granite of the marina walls. In his red nylon jacket he is a faded version of himself.\n\nHoekstra knows where I am from. Now he comes to the point.\n\n\"Jozef, I want you to take back to Hoofdkerk.\"\n\nI have already decided not to go back. I turn my face toward an older couple sitting on the bench in front of me near the bar. The man's head is bald and his headband is a wide, graying stripe across his skull and around his collar. She has on jeans and a pink polo of the type men sometimes wear in the fall. Both of them seem not to notice my presence. I think I will leave them for a few more minutes. Hoekstra takes my elbow and guides me towards him. I look down at the marina, which has long ago been transformed into a giant green golf course. Soon the marina has disappeared, and only the green and blue of the sky remains. I feel like a ship's ball, or a marconi. We walk and walk and the world stretches ahead of us like a long tunnel between the green and blue of the sky.\n\nWe walk for a long time, to the point where, as Hoekstra leads me, I do not feel like turning around or walking back, even if I could move again.\n\nHoekstra suddenly takes my elbow in his hand and I look up into his face. I have been following him since morning and have not seen him look away or put his head down, as he would have when he was embarrassed. I am starting to think he is ashamed of me, as much as he was ashamed of me when I was young and my father was a pastor. Suddenly my old pride rises again.\n\n\"Jozef's mother has been dead for many years.\"\n\n\"Why do you call him Józef?\" I stop walking and turn to face Hoekstra.\n\n\"I like the sound of it,\" he says. \"It means 'lover of the sea.' \" He opens his arms wider.\n\nMy arm is now touching his shoulders. Hoekstra smiles as I look up at his face. His hair is longer now and his cheekbones are a little sharper than they are in this moment. It has been a long day and the sun has already gone down. I turn to look along the narrow strip of the harbor, where he smiles and leans over again with an arm around me.\n\n\"The ocean is where I live. My boat is still there.\"\n\n\"But isn't your sister there...\"\n\n\"She has a room with a balcony upstairs.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can ask her to come down?\"\n\n\"In all honesty, I haven't slept all night listening to you, as I do with everything else.

Hoekstra nods, but I can tell he does not understand.\n\n\"And I am sixty-one.\"\n\n\"Is that so different?\"\n\n\"It is different, but you are still fifty years older than me. You can never be old. You will always be young and I will look on you as an old man.\"\n\n\"We do not know why you have grown so old, my friend, we do not know. But that is the way it is.

{"text": "In Britain, Norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork, and in the 17th & 18th century, most art historian thought that Norman sculptors did not sculpt in marble. Today, the use of marble in sculpture has been accepted as an art form. Sculptors created stone sculpture with great skill, such as that in Caen stone and carved stone. In recent times, it was discovered that many works of the early French sculptors, like Léonard de Vinci in his garden, also had a use of marble. These discoveries were recorded by Sir Arthur Evans, who published his study “The Decorative Arts of the British Museum” in 1934.\n\nThe Normans\nThe Normans swept into Britain in the first part of the 11th century. The history of the English invasion from northern France includes battles, battles and more battles. The Norman conquest of England was a prolonged war of succession and conquest. Although the Normans had some fighting on the battlefields they did not take the land, nor did they want to. The invaders established a new kingdom of England and Wales. The land they took is sometimes called Britain, the land of the English or simply England from today’s standpoint.\n\nEngland in the Middle Ages\nThe country was occupied by different warlords during the 13th, 14th and 17th centuries. The power and glory of the British Isles remained largely intact, apart from what came later. The economy was mainly agrarian, trade was at a low level, and towns were small and self-sufficient. At that time, England was a small, very poor country, with only some cities.\n\nNorman art\n\nIn Norman period, stone was produced as building material and architectural sculpture, but also for other functions. Norman architecture combined the features of Romanesque with new features, in some ways similar to the Gothic style that followed in the second half of the 13th century. Stone statues are often found in Norman stone buildings, as a sign of status, or for their beauty. Medieval stone was the most commonly used building material – stone floors, stone pillars, stone walls, stone roofs.\n\nThe main building material on earth was wood and other building materials that have a combination of strength and light weight suitable for constructing buildings or sculptures and can often withstand heat and moisture. The strength of wood was greatly valued during all periods of history, as evidenced by its use in weapons and in ship construction. At the time of the Norman Conquest, the best wood in England was oak, and many large buildings included the trunks of that tree.\n\nWood was first extensively used in architecture in Italy in the 10th century, and the timber used for construction in England has evolved in a similar direction ever since, with different kinds for different functions.\n\nSculpture\nMany large stone statues were sculpted for the decoration of walls, doors, arches, windows and so on, or for the statues of saints and angels, to decorate the sanctuary of churches. These statues stood in the main room of a building of some kind (typically a basilica), along with the statue on the high altar, or in the main chapel of a cathedral. Some of the statues were in statuesque position, whereas others were in more sober profile view.\n\nA large number of statues of historical figures were created. Some statues have been restored, but most are in the process of restoration today. There were two major styles, the round, and the square or oblong.\n\nThe round statues with the feet pointing towards the center of the statues, where the head is located.\n\nSculptures in large reliefs have been called polychrome statues. They were carved in two colors, either marble or stone colors, and sometimes were made in polychrome style.\n\nSculptures in rectangular form with the head positioned to the right side of the sculpture were called trapeziels, “trapezoids”. Those with the head on the left side of the statue were considered “drapers”, “drapiers”, “battiers” or “batteurs”.\n\nSculptures with the body to the right were called “arches” or “portables”, and those with the body to the left were considered “mantelets” or “lancetors”.\n\nSculptures standing in the center of an architectural space were called “tables” or “tablestairs” where the head is positioned at a lower altitude, usually at the center of the entrance door of a house.\n\nSculptures in columns (or arches) were called “columns”, or “columnar” because of their architectural function, when they were part of a building. The other sculptures (most figures) in columns were", "label": "gptneo"}

But I do remember one of my friends making some sort of comment about it, and that a number of people were going to the opening of the film, though no one had shown up. So my reaction was \"Well, if they've been to the cinema then they must have heard about it. So there must be a good bit. And the best way to learn about a piece of media is to watch and read about it. If someone told me the plot of it I might even listen to it.\"\n\nTo my utter surprise I did then also discover that a number of friends had read the book, but they hadn't been to see the movie, so the \"experience\" wasn't exactly the same as mine or hers.\n\nIf you have read it, you will know that the movie adaptation is a very bad picture and a miserable misrepresentation of the true story. It is even worse because of the fact that it is based on a true story.\n\nIt had a mixed critical reception. Some people liked it, some didn't and some loved it.\n\nI don't read Anne Rice any more. I used to listen to her, and now I don't seem to want to read or care for her anymore. She is an anti-hero with a rather thin and artificial sense of morality just like many people who write in these comment boxes and use the same sort of arguments.\n\nYes, I have had to listen to Anne Rice read some of her books and the books and other \"authorities\" that have been written about her. Like when I found out that The Vampire Lestat was going into production and we had to go and see it.\n\nWhen I told my wife, she said that she too found that she didn't care for the film version of The Vampire Lestat, and even though she had read some of the books. So she would not go and see any of the screenings of the new movie version, she didn't need to now.\n\nAll the more reason to go and see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay--Part 1.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nI believe it's because I have a family member who went to see it yesterday, only two days before this post!\n\nI didn't, but I have read Anne Rice at least twice. It is a very good read, I have never read or will read her books in their entirety. The movie, however, makes very little sense. In my opinion, the point to make is this: what will happen when young teenagers get to experience the adult world, and that is not for them to determine. I don't know what the solution is, but I do know that it is not to be in young people's hands.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nWell said! I liked what your friend said and I agree 100%. It's what happens after they leave that matters more.\n\nAs for The Hunger Games--one thing I can't understand is how they thought it would be successful when it clearly was not. It's been shown at least three (non sequiturs) since its production that it is a joke.\n\nI never went to see the movie I read about last week. The movie and the book are two of about ten books I have read by Anne Rice, and I read the book.\n\nI went to the movies last year when J.K Rowling premiered the Harry Potter series. I sat there with a woman who had just watched the series. I wondered what was wrong with the movie. I have no idea, but it was the same for us (and the woman said she liked the movie).\n\nI don't really want to be here today and see the movie. I hope someone can give me an explanation. I liked the books and the movie, but I can't tell you why.\n\nI want to know why it so bad. And I did like it. I did not feel like some big secret was hidden from me. I did not feel as though I was going to die. I felt like a normal person being shown. I feel like Anne Rice was a real person instead of a fictional one.\n\nI read the books and would like it if it would make a good movie.\n\nClick to expand...\n\nI thought I did, but I could not be sure, which is why I tried to find out about it.\n\nI did like the movie, and I still want to read all of her books, and I did find out some things, but I didn't like what was told about the other books.\n\nI don't think I should get too upset, like you did.

ChemPhys., in press] and to describe microstructures of non-equilibrium systems [Gautier, R.; Cocks, J.; Dujardin, F.; Vigier, B. 2004, J. Non-Cryst. Solids, in press]. This formalism is based upon Maxwell’s laws of electrostatics and upon classical and quantum electrodynamics:\n\n-   Electrostatic properties of each charged point of a system are described through electrostatic potentials or electrostatic potential and electric field. They depend only on the distance $r$ between the charges and on their relative orientation or on their relative magnitudes.\n\n-   Electron and proton distributions and correlations (electron-proton correlation functions or radial distribution functions) are generated by local Coulomb repulsion forces acting at different points of contact [@klei; @baker; @vigier-PRB; @vigier-PRX]. These forces depend solely on the distance $d$ between two points and on their orientations or on their magnitudes.\n\nWe want here to use this formalism to show how to model a particular chemical evolution as following the temperature of the heat bath (for details see [@vigier-PRB]). To do that we need to specify the evolution of the chemical potential $\\mu(t,\\vec{r})$ associated with the local energy density $e(t,\\vec{r})$ in which we define $e(t,\\vec{r})=\\frac{1}{2}m(t,\\vec{r})(\\vec{v}(t,\\vec{r})\\cdot\\nabla\\vec{v}(t,\\vec{r})-\\nabla P(t,\\vec{r}))$, with $P(t,\\vec{r})$ the pressure field and $\\vec{v}(t,\\vec{r})$ the velocity field of the system.\n\nAn arbitrary chemical evolution $\\mu(t,\\vec{r})$ as defined above, can be generated by an external force $I_{ext}/c$ (as in the ideal conductor with a constant energy transfer rate) directed along a direction $\\vec r_{ext}$ [@baker]. We want here to define another type of chemical evolution under the influence of time-dependent external forces $I_{ext}(t,\\vec{r})$ (see section III below).

A modified set of transport coefficients ($\\alpha$) has been constructed by using the acceleration and transport parameters for electrons and the acceleration and transport parameters for protons in the transition region and corona, and using the mean magnetic topology and CR electron energy spectrum obtained from the observations on the solar surface and the lower corona.\n\nTo model the transition from the lower corona to the upper corona, the CR electron number density profile in the low corona of a solar flare is taken to be the function of vertical height $Z$ instead of the distance $r$ from the disk centre. We consider the flare (solar storm) with maximum of $\\sim$ 2% of total CR flux, which is a typical case. The number density of electrons at 10 R$_\\odot$ during a solar flare has been calculated by means of the analytical solution and the numerical code described in [@2000SSRv...95..161D].\n\nOur analysis starts with the following assumptions: 1) in the lower chromosphere and the transition region the non-relativistic (i.e. $k_g=0$) and relativistic ($k_g=\\infty$) solutions of the Klein-Nishina and R.S. Bohm diffusion equations are equivalent. 2) The transport of relativistic CR electrons is efficient in the lower chromosphere and the transition region (as in the case of relativistic particles like muons and electrons) and inefficient ($\\alpha=0.5$ and $\\alpha=2$) in the corona, where the typical height of the transition region is assumed to be $Z=50$ R$_\\odot$. 3) During the passage through the corona with $Z<50$ R$_\\odot$, the CR electrons (in the CR transport case) escape with a rate of $\\alpha$ from the source region and travel with the velocity of $|v-c|$. 4) The CR electrons are distributed along the radial direction from the source region with the power law energy distributions $$f_\\mathrm{CR,Z<50}(E_{\\mathrm{CR}})=\\gamma(E_{\\mathrm{CR}}{Z})^{-\\delta}\\,,\\quad\n\\gamma=0.5,\\delta=0.25.$$ Above the radius $Z=50$ R$_\\odot$ the electrons are distributed with another power law energy distribution in a range of lower energies $eE_{100})$ where $e$ is a small (and finite) number, $$f_\\mathrm{CR,Z>50}(E_{\\mathrm{cr}})=\\gamma(E_{\\mathrm{cr}}{Z})^{-\\delta}\\,,\\quad\n\\gamma=1\\,,\\quad e=1.$$\n\nThe CR electrons are considered to have power law energies $E_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ from the interval of $10^4$ to $10^3$ keV (the corresponding energy intervals in the range of a few 10 keV are similar.) The corresponding injection rate $\\epsilon_{Z<50}$ of the CR electrons from the source region is assumed to be $$\\epsilon_{Z<50}=1.0 \\times 10^{10} \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{neV})^{-1} \\times z /Z \\,,\n\\label{eq:injrate}$$ where $z$ is the radius of the source region and depends on the electron energy $E_{\\mathrm{cr}}$.\n\nThe energy spectrum $f(E_{\\mathrm{cr}})$ of the injected electrons is assumed to be $$f(E_{\\mathrm{cr}})=C(Z) (E_{\\mathrm{cr}}{Z})^{-\\delta}\n\\label{spectrum}$$ where $C$ is a normalization constant, and $\\delta <0.5,\\, \n\\delta=0.25$.

{"text": "The Harper government is ratcheting up the pressuree on Russia over its behaviour in Ukraine, warning it will be “forced” to take “action” if it continues to do as it has.\n\nThe government also issued an ultimatum to Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying it intends to sanction his country and it’s oligarch allies in a move that would have been considered a war-footing for NATO last year. But if it follows through on that, other European countries will follow, and “we will not make Russia's problem that much bigger,” said senior Cabinet minister Julian Fantino, adding that NATO would then have to respond. “We will be forced to take action in order to maintain the unity of Europe,\" he said. The move marks the most forceful condemnation yet of Russia's actions, including the support of pro-Russia forces in Ukraine. Mr. Fantino said it wasn't only the Ukrainian government that was behind Russian moves, but also a significant number of governments in Europe and the United States. \"We will continue to go down this road if it continues. But I think it would be in our interest to move to a much more effective response,\" he said. NATO said its decision to confront Russia was based on the information it has at hand as well as information it had received after meeting Ukrainian leaders. “In the event Russia further demonstrates that it will act with impunity by directly supporting the overthrow of a democratic government, all NATO member states are prepared to consider potential follow-on responses,” said a NATO statement. President Barack Obama said in a statement that the U.S. has been trying “since day one to avoid any escalation in the situation,” but stressed that this decision had not been forced on him. “If Russia fails to live up to its commitments, other countries may decide that it is necessary for their own security interests to take additional steps,” he said.\n\nWhat this means, of course, is that there is absolutely no chance of Russia backing down. Indeed, the response (or worse) is already in the making. Russia has been hit with a series of sanctions for its destabilizing action in Georgia, and this time, it won't be able to claim its actions were isolated incidents and then try to wriggle off the hook. The move is also going to force European countries to react.\n\nWhat's the rush, though? This is not the first time a U.S. administration has stepped up the pressure on Russia. The U.S. has been demanding that Russia cease its support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine, and for supporting the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Why start over when there already is a precedent?\n\nActions by the U.S. include sanctions against Russian oligarchs and its government. Other countries follow suit, and the U.S. can't afford to go down without a fight. It's just a matter of time until some other European country joins in, either in order to further their own strategic goals or because of a sense of national mission.\n\nSo they do it with a stroke - with a full frontal military attack against Russia, they'll likely force that country to respond. The EU will likely do the same in order to preserve a semblance of unity around the world, because a united Europe is the key to preventing a major war from breaking out.\n\nThe EU has taken action in the past when Russia's intransigence was causing it problems, both in Georgia and Ukraine. It was forced to agree to a temporary ceasefire with Russia to protect its citizens and for Russia to agree to a cease fire for Ukraine.\n\nThis time, though, the threat of a NATO response gives Russia no choice but to respond.\n\nIf the world didn't want to go to war, then the situation would be different, just more diplomatic action involving Russia, Europe and the U.S. Russia would have had much more leeway to respond to U.S. pressure, and the world would be on to the next stage in the conflict. This action means a war will break out when Russia has little choice.\n\nThere is no justification for NATO's use of armed forces on the European continent - it only encourages aggressive behaviour, which is exactly what Russia is accused of during this crisis. But NATO is a necessary evil, and if Russia has to be \"forced\" to back down, then so be it.\n\nThere's no point in denying that Russia is a threat to Europe and the U.S. - they all see it, just as they see each other. The key will be to contain the damage - to do something that shows Russia that it has to give in. If the EU decides to cut ties with Russia, then Russia will feel the pressure, and the issue will be a moot point. However, Russia would still be able to call it an \"isolated incident\".

{"text": "First borns score higher than siblings in IQ tests as early as age two - and their moms have more influence on them.\n\nResearchers have known since the early 60s that offspring do not typically fare as well as children who share the same parentage.\n\nBut new research published Tuesday in the American Journal of Public Health suggests that the cognitive differences between brothers and sisters is not due to the inherent nature of males and females; the different environmental influences that shape our brains and lives; or the impact of nurture vs. nature.\n\n\"There is more influence on kids from moms versus dads,\" said Dr. Jennifer O'Connell, the study's lead author and an associate professor of epidemiology, of environmental sciences, and of population studies and public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University. \"It appears like moms have more of an influence on siblings and parents.\"\n\nWhen siblings are compared, moms had an effect in almost every outcome, the research said. They made an impact on boys' cognition in cognitive tasks at age two and on girls' at five. In some cases, moms had a stronger influence on girls. In other cases, moms had a much stronger impact on boys. The researchers found that these differences did not occur randomly between siblings but were often gender-specific, meaning that the mom’s effect was stronger for girls but not boys.\n\nIn other words, if girls are having better cognitive scores when they are given the same test at age two, it would lead to a better score when they would take the test again at five, said O’Connell.\n\nShe said that’s something to be expected: It is the same test they have taken at two and five-years-old.\n\n“Mothers are influencing their children and they make more positive changes for kids around the time they develop. If you look at kids at two versus five, that’s a pretty significant difference at the age of two,” O’Connell said. “It is the same test they are taking when they are young, and because mother’s have more influence than fathers, it seems like moms are influencing more sons’ scores vs. daughters’ scores.”\n\nO’Connell said the results should encourage further investigation into whether moms’ influence of children has an impact on later academic achievements even after the children reach an age where those effects may be seen as diminishing.\n\nThe new research is one of several that have suggested similar effects. Another study was published last year in the Journal of Family Psychology that found mothers’ influence on children’s scores on IQ tests was stronger in children growing up in families with more income and wealth. As O’Connell noted, the study didn’t look at siblings because the older siblings may have had no influence at all on the younger ones and the researchers thought more research was needed. But the researchers who did look at siblings showed that moms’ impact on younger siblings was greater than the influence on older siblings.\n\nO'Connell added to a recent New York Times article that \"the science shows that there are certain types of influence on kids. And moms are one of those,\" she said.\n\nA couple of researchers who weren’t involved in the study noted that the differences between sons vs. daughters may be due to factors that don’t yet have a name.\n\nA paper published in the Journal of Health Psychology last June looked at the connection between parents and offspring and the effect on the offspring’s brain, but there is also potential variation between mothers and fathers.\n\nIn a paper that looked at the relationship between mothers' and fathers' influence on children's school performance, they found that only the mother’s impact was positive. However, the effect was small, meaning there was not significant influence.\n\nMore research is needed to figure out the nature of the links that do exist between parents and children, said study co-author Dr. Stephanie Gudde.\n\nResearch has also shown that children without siblings typically score the highest in academics.\n\n\"We are at a point now that we know that the quality of a child's relationship with a mother or a father also plays an important role in its educational outcomes,\" Gudde told The Hill.\n\nAs for the effect of siblings on parents, researchers have known that this phenomenon occurs when dads are away in military service, they are away in high school and are unemployed.\n\nO'Connell said that these findings are different from other studies that suggest parents and their children are more similar than opposite when it comes to IQ.\n\n\"This research, as far as we know, shows that mother's IQ are higher so it's not the case that parents with lower IQ are more similar to their offspring in terms of their cognition,\" O’Connell said. \"There are some differences between children and parents", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR point out that the \"probability model\" of quantum mechanics that we all learned in high school is actually only a probabilistic account of probability—that a single probability distribution for the entire universe can provide an accurate description of any world event when that probability distribution is consistent with the observed events.\n\nIt is possible to make a quantitative, coherent, and probabilistic statement of the notion that nature has \"a kind of beauty\" (or, as more recently, \"intrigues\") that we can discover experimentally. We call it \"intrigence,\" or more recently, \"intelligent design\" (see below to determine for yourself my definition of \"intelligent\"). But the reality is something very different. Nature does not have a single, consistent, coherent, and even intelligible model that we are capable of ever producing.\n\nThe fact is, nature is full of contradictory information. Information can be described by probability distributions, but each of these distributions is also an inference. There is no one simple model that is consistent with all the observations that we have made. Nature does not have an ontological \"mind\"; she does not have a single and consistent, coherent \"model\" that is capable of encompassing all observation and every possible future observation.\n\nIn light of this very real truth, it is also true to say that nature is not, in principle, intelligible. We are able to create models that are consistent and coherent and are based on scientific knowledge, but it is only natural for all of these models be different from nature itself. We have, however, developed a very practical and effective means of making such models, of representing nature mathematically in a simple and coherent fashion. We call this representation a \"quantum computer,\" as we have created such a model of nature in a very short period of time and have been able to apply it to problems that were not predictable, where previously we couldn't even dream of addressing them \"with our computers.\"\n\nIn this book the term \"intelligent design\" refers to a theory that I was very confident of and believed since the late 1970s until the mid-1980s (in the form of the belief in intelligent superstring theory), but is actually a concept that has no scientific validity. I can write about an Intelligent Design model, but I will not be able to defend it as it does not conform to reality. We have been presented with mathematical representations of the universe that would make the discovery of the laws of nature \"intelligible\"—that is: make sense of our observations.\n\nThere are three key points in this theory that need to be addressed:\n\n  * the definition of \"design\";\n  * the definition of \"intellect\" (or even of \"intelligencing\"); and\n  * the evidence for or against such statements of fact.\n\nFor the scientific community, the only valid meaning of \"design is as we define it today, in terms of a \"purpose or need,\" or something along the lines of \"purpose or need\" in natural law,\" which is a statement of fact. Scientists and the people who do research have no interest in any theory of intelligent design (though they may have an interest in the definition of the terms used in my statements), but they do have an interest in the truth, the reasonableness, and the validity of my statements.\n\n  * The definition and validity of the idea of an \"intelligent designer,\" as discussed in this book (see Chapter 5) are subject to debate.\n\nEven though much has been written on intelligent design, the debate is far from over and even after some significant shifts in public sentiment have occurred, the \"debate\" about intelligent design continues. We can see how this debate has become far more polarized with the publication on February 4 of the National Public Radio's show _Talk of the Nation_ entitled \"Intelligent Design: What Is It and Where's the Evidence?\"\n\nThe book can be downloaded freely from the CEPR website on the webpage \"The Science Behind Intelligent Design.\" The CEPR website also contains links to other intelligent design sites on the Internet and it is possible to download the entire collection of materials from one of the website links and search through the many files there that describe and support the theory of life's development and of the origin of life, including information on the origin of the three major branches of genetic information.\n\n  * There are two arguments that I am interested in regarding the question of intelligent design:\n\nThe first is the argument that scientists tend to make. Scientists tend to be arrogant, to claim a monopoly on knowledge and on truth, which have all the appearance of being established facts. Some science skeptics are not scientific skeptics, they are religious and religious skeptics, but they believe in \"intelligent design\" as a religious belief system. As a \"skeptic,\" I am comfortable with their religion and do not want to get into it here. Some", "label": "gptneo"}

Patrick Wright ( see \"Bibliography\" below )\n\nthe wardens\n\nFor many years, the wizards and the wards were a single and unified political entity. From the earliest days of the wizarding world to the mid-twentieth century, before the rise of the modern government in England and the United States, their political identity was that of one unified and powerful organization of wizards. This is a story about how the guardians, the most senior of the magical communities, gradually took themselves out of that identity to embrace the identity of a social class, a society and a nation, to become a new entity, a new type of organization of wizards. It is a story about how they achieved this.\n\nThis is a big story. This is a narrative in which people who have done a lot of individual research and writing, some for more than a century, take the story back and present it in a way that makes the whole story, by the time you read it, make sense to you.\n\nCharles K. Patrick Wright\n\nCharles K. Patrick Wright (1919–1995) was a journalist, writer, poet, and critic. He was the author of two science fiction novels, an opera, and several poetry collections. In 1953 he became director of the University of Southern Mississippi Press, where he established the university's first program in science fiction writing. He received the Pulitzer Prize for the Science Fiction or Fantasy Writing Program, and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 1986. Patrick Wright is survived by his wife Catherine of over sixty years.\n\nThe \"W\"\n\nWe are, of course, the wizards.\n\n—Harry Houdini, quoted in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography\n\nWizarding World\n\nThe history of the wizarding world is closely tied up with the history of the wizards. In the wizarding world, the wizards have always been a distinct and separate class of magic-users—a powerful and respected and unique order of magical individuals. Their history started many hundreds of years before the Wizards' Congress, with the development of the first wizards. This began with the creation of a powerful group of people who performed magic for personal reasons—some in the search for personal or religious enlightenment, some in competition—and who came to be known as “wizards”. As time passed, magic grew in scale and power until, by the middle of the eighteenth century, there was a “sophisticated” (by modern standards, anyway) magic community that was so powerful that it was able to challenge the dominance of the church, and to make its own forms of law and set of values that formed the base for some of the laws of magic which are still in effect today. In the nineteenth century there was an increase in magical power until, by the First World War, the magic of the wizards was so great that it was able to challenge the magic of the wizards in the world during World War 1, and the wizarding world became divided between a victorious army which had created and controlled all the magic in the world, which, as a result, was not able to function for long before all magic became useless, and a losing one. At the same time, there was a large and growing population of wizards within the United Kingdom who were not part of the winning side of this war. There seemed to be so little chance of success that a growing number of wizards started secretly forming an alliance and started fighting (but losing) war on the side of the United Kingdom. The war brought about a great split between the wizarding world as a whole. The wizards lost control of all the magic in the world (although, of course, not all the British wizards lost control at the same time). The wizards within the United Kingdom, for their part, gained the ability to create or destroy magic with their mere will or by some other means.\n\nThe wizards of the United Kingdom, being divided by the war and their own history of defeat and defeat, had a difficult time fighting a war for very long against the world magic—not against the wizarding world, against most of the magic, which was a divided group. With the war going on, there was a need (at least before World War 2) to keep all magic in one place and to keep all power in one place. The United Kingdom managed to achieve this without war, even though the battle of the World War 2 brought more wizards on both sides of the war into the world magic. This war brought with it an end to the practice of the ancient practice of wizard control over magic—wizards using their will at the cost of magic being used for the benefit of their world, instead", "label": "gptneo"}

The short features plenty of Betty White and George Clooney banter! It would be a pretty great family film to watch with the kids! Betty White and George Clooney appear in a series of animated shorts called \"Pee Pants & Puppy Love\" (about 2:52 min and 19k). Betty appears in many more Pee Pants & Puppy Love animated shorts, which I have not found information on on YouTube.\n\nIt features Betty and George Clooney and their little dog named \"Puppy Love\".\n\nYou have three options:\n\n1. View the animation on YouTube\n2. Purchase the DVD or download the file\n3. Stream it from youtube in HTML5 or using an application on your\n                mobile device\n\nNote 1: You can also purchase \"Peep Show\" on iTunes, for iPod users.

It's my opinion that this is one of the best animated films of the year.\n\nNote 3: I do not support the death penalty.\n\nNote 4: I understand that Betty White has died. You can view and browse through all of her shows, interviews and other material on youtube.com.\n\nNote 5: Betty White and George Clooney appear as themselves and as their dog, Puppy Love.\n\nYou can purchase a DVD or DVD-R today directly from Amazon or other sites. Just click the title to go to Amazon or other site. You will be taken to a page where you can do direct pay-by-credit card. You can also pay by check, money order (or paypal) to avoid the fees charged by credit card processors in America.\n\nYou cannot purchase a DVD or DVD-R directly from the manufacturer from the USA. You might be able to from the rest of the world, and also if you have a US bank account and credit card. But most likely when you order directly from the manufacturer you will be charged a premium. These premium packages are offered by the manufacturer under the auspices of the manufacturer. The DVDs are usually packaged in packages. DVD-R are different and they have their own package.\n\nJust looking at this picture makes me want to watch this. The dog looks as if he has a big heart!\n\nI just saw the movie in 3D and it was awesome! There are some really great characters in this movie, Betty is one of them, but I also found George Clooney to be one of the more interesting characters. George doesn't have a normal life, his wife is having an affair with a business man, so he gets to a lot about his life from her side. He's not a very happy person, but he doesn't act all happy, like Tom Cruise in Indiana Jones! I don't think this will work for everyone, I liked it, but it isn't going to work with everyone. I would give it two thumbs up. And you can always check out the YouTube Channel - GeorgeClooney - where he talks about many of the aspects of his life. Check it out!\n\nGreat little animated comedy. Betty White and George Clooney play a big brother to a brother but are actually the opposite of each other. I liked the humor and it kept my attention. In my opinion, it was a bit too early in their career for them to be so comedic. The only downside to this film is that it was the only cartoon I haven't seen so far this year. I'm looking forward to seeing more of these little animated films that are available now in HD.\n\nThe film only ran for 22 minutes or so, but that was enough time to have me interested enough to watch some more. This is more of a silly animated comedy than anything else but it didn't make me laugh out loud either. I would say most people will be into this for the first 20 minutes or so and then get bored. I watched it again to try to rekindle my interest. I don't know if that helps.\n\nI really liked this movie, but it ran long. I had to get it on dvd. I was expecting a shorter movie. I thought it would have been okay if it did the full 22 minutes and it would get you to the end so you could say the ending and get on with \"the next chapter\" - and I'm not that far into the movie yet, I have to find out more. - Thanks, Paul.\n\nThanks for these great reviews! I've never heard of this film before. I'm interested to see what the movie is like", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "Their seven-wicket victory in the third Test gave England an invaluable three-day period to recover from last week’s disappointment and rekindle their winning confidence. They needed at least that to set them up for the final Test of the series.\n\nThe new-ball bowlers in their fourth innings were not especially good, although there was a fair bit of quality in the attack as a whole. The England batsmen struggled at first but began to play a much more attacking style this morning.\n\nFirst, there was Peter Siddle’s two wickets, then Ben Foakes took three wickets for just four runs – two of them stumpings – and now they needed to get them off their bowling figures for four or five runs. ‘I was really trying,’ admitted an exuberant Siddle, who has won the toss for England in all three Tests in this series, ‘but I was probably out to myself. I tried as hard as I could but it just wasn’t quite going my way, especially with the wicket. I can’t explain it. I tried to be aggressive and I probably wasn’t looking for the wicket and tried to push, but it just wasn’t coming off.’\n\n‘I am delighted,’ added Siddle, whose recent form suggests he could be used more often at the top of a batting order after making his top Test score this morning. ‘I think some of the wickets I have been given, they weren’t particularly challenging so it was good to take wickets. It was a good pitch, it gave you bounce, I think it is a good pitch. I am delighted that I still had the ability today to get bat on ball and get wicket at eight overs.’\n\nSo, with his second-innings figures for England in the game he has just bowled five balls, Siddle was also pleased with the way Ben Foakes played in his first spell. ‘In the first over I tried to play a lot more and when I got in, I found a big gap there for Ben to drive. He did alright, I thought he did alright, he bowled really well. He has not disappointed, but I think he has given himself more opportunities to bat, as he can bat a little quicker. You know, he’s an older age lad and you always want him to come out, the last time against Australia, he came out of the game after seven, eight overs and you could see the ball coming in from him.’ He has also found the ball going into the on-side, although he concedes this is just a small thing that could become regularity.\n\n‘You know, Australia had a number three bowler there who bowled very often and did a lot of line and length, he was pretty good. He used to bowl a lot at me and I have always tried to bowl to him and tried to do the same to him. I would have used a different approach today if I was batting first. Unfortunately because the ball was really going round, it was pretty difficult.\n\n‘It was still pretty good. It was better, I had to bowl four balls. I bowled four balls and England’s wicketkeeper got us out for six. I put a length of ball in every ball. If I put a short, mid-on [length] in, then he could hit it to cover, that’s what I did. It was the wrong length and that was going into the on-side and we had our wickets, I could see that.\n\n‘The wicket’s nice and firm, it gives you a little bit of bounce, but you know, if you bowl a full length ball down that’s a really good catch by the keeper, you do lose wicket if you bowl this full length on it. He is not particularly strong there, so he was coming down and he took two catches as well. He’s a pretty good keeper but he can take them too. I have learnt from him over the years.’\n\nSiddle had made 23, Foakes seven in his first spell to take the game to lunch. England have struggled with the ball in the first innings, with the most notable performance of note being the second-innings dismissal of England’s debut-captain Alastair Cook for 31, his second first-wicket score in his second innings in the game in Adelaide in his Test debut in 2005. In this match, however, he did nothing wrong and bowled solidly as he moved his left-handers into play. This morning, he did the same again.\n\nIt is a measure of England’s strength and ability as a unit and also a measure of Siddle’s bowling ability that England�", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "He had refused a vote on the bill, which was the first formal rejection of the Trump presidency ever. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Legal Trump's move could trigger lawsuit, impeachment push Republicans push for removal, Senate vote will determine how Trump responds The president has been accused of acting with 'duress,' lawmakers say.\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared Tuesday that Senate Democrats “must change the rules in order to win an election” to protect voters from the “rigged” system of voting.\n\nThe president’s move could trigger a lawsuit, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that she will go to the floor of the House to demand that the rules change, signaling that Democrats will go “forward” to impeach the president over his alleged obstruction of Congress and abuse of power.\n\n\nBut there is uncertainty over whether the Republican-controlled Senate would grant the White House’s request to push forward with the case now, when a number of Republican senators are facing elections. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has acknowledged that Trump sought a delay on the health care bill so he could ram through a bill without a Democratic support.\n\nTrump could then be asked to sign a law to waive the Constitution’s so-called Speech or Debate Clause requiring the president to give up his own salary during an impeachment trial or impeachment proceeding, but it seems less likely that he will do so. In addition, with the Senate on a lengthy recess and expected to vote on health care later Tuesday, the White House could go to court seeking to block Schumer’s motion calling for the rules to be changed.\n\nThe Senate is expected to begin a two week recess Tuesday with only three days between Senate sessions. Trump had declared the House would be a “disaster” and the Senate a “total and complete disaster” for the country while at the same time asking senators to vote.\n\nIn the House, Democrats have called for an impeachment inquiry, after multiple witnesses testified over two weeks of testimony in the Senate, including the testimony of White House staff. The testimony of former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe also added to the pressure on Trump, after the president publicly told McCabe at a White House meeting last year that he could have him fired if he did not “come up with dirt” on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe New York Times reported Tuesday that senior White House and Justice Department officials, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and White House Counsel Don McGahn, instructed McGahn to fire McCabe after consulting with the DOJ’s “Office of Professional Responsibility,” citing their concern about “a politically motivated termination.”\n\nTrump had asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into Carter Page, a Democratic National Committee political donor, when he learned that Page had met with Trump’s campaign officials, according to the report.\n\nMcCabe wrote in his memos that the incident “exhibited a clear lack of judgment and put integrity rules and standards above loyalty to country.”\n\nThe Hill reported Tuesday that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly privately complained to Trump that he and other top aides weren't being fired, or at least not as severely as he felt. But when it became clear that the Justice Department wasn't about to dismiss McCabe, Kelly reportedly told Trump that the “next time I see you I want you to thank me.”\n\nThat was an apparent reference to Trump’s reported belief, even as a candidate and during the presidential campaign, that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016 election because she was a “weak” candidate.\n\nMcCabe’s firing, however, didn’t seem to cause Trump’s White House staffers much concern, as they continued implementing his directives, as well as sending out other letters to Comey and others within Comey’s leadership, telling them not to comment on the Comey firing when that would put him in danger.\n\nAfter the White House Counsel’s Office and outside legal analysts pointed to McCabe for firing Comey to get a special counsel appointed, Comey wrote a letter outlining his concerns and noting that he had never considered firing Comey.\n\nAccording to Yahoo News, “McCabe, Trump officials and Comey all agree that the only explanation for his firing is that Comey told the truth when he said he was investigating the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia in connection with the Trump Tower meeting — evidence the White House didn’t want to see leaked publicly.”\n\nFox News’ Catherine Herridge and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "label": "gptneo"}

Lee and General Stonewall Jackson, is one of Jacksonville's most impressive remaining examples of Spanish colonial architecture and one of Europe's finest man-made islands. A historic home for families, Capecitos has seen an explosion of creative, award-winning private events, making this an ideal location for private weddings and corporate events.\n\nThe Jacksonville Pier, first opened in 1930, is a 1.5-mile-long pier that stretches across the Intracoastal Waterway to the Atlantic Ocean. Today, the Jacksonville International Airport is located adjacent to the pier, and two of the three historic ferries connecting to Jacksonville go directly from the airport to the Pier. The Jacksonville Maritime Museum, located within walking distance of the pier, contains an excellent collection of maritime artifacts, paintings, photographs, paintings, artifacts, ship models, memorabilia, documents, and more.\n\nThe Southland shopping center consists of three distinct sections. The centerpiece is its signature two-level arcade, featuring boutiques, local restaurants, as well as a hotel and two other restaurants. The Southland is one of Jacksonville's most upscale shopping facilities, and it contains four- and five­ stories of high-end name brand stores that offer shoppers an experience designed to be one of the most exciting in the area.\n\nLocated on the banks of Orange Avenue, near the intersection of Jacksonville Beach Boulevard, this charming, private residential neighborhood has long been a home to a large African-American population and an array of churches and other unique private residences. Today, the community has undergone a period of significant redevelopment with the addition of a second hotel and the unveiling of a new, modern, and state-of-the-art mall (and the revitalization of the historic St. Johns Town Square housing development)—both within a short distance of Orange Avenue.\n\nHome to the first large community college in Florida, Jacksonville State University offers a wide variety of programs, the largest of which are located here. The university also boasts a history of excellent faculty, with many former members of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marines teaching a wide variety of subjects here.\n\nJacksonville has grown explosively in the last decade, and its downtown area has become the most vibrant of the metropolitan areas in South Florida. This central business district offers the finest shops, restaurants, and entertainment, most notably at the newly constructed Jacksonville Landing. The city of Jacksonville has also emerged as one of the fastest growing cities in the country (its population has doubled since 2000) and enjoys a vibrant cultural life as well as numerous outstanding educational opportunities, including the University of North Florida, St. Thomas University, and Jacksonville State University.\n\nThis postcard of a Jacksonville beach scene clearly shows the historic mansions perched on sandhills on Jek'let Island (the northernmost island in the chain). The sandhills were originally cultivated by the Phoenicians. The first English colonists to settle the area were the Spaniards, who soon named the bay \"Jalapeño\" (\"island of the pepper bushes\"). As a result, the island was named for a bay in the province of the same name on the Spanish mainland. In 1638, King Charles I of England ordered all English settlement in South Florida to be destroyed, ending the region's British colonial history. The area was taken back from the Spanish by the Jesuits and became part of the French Province of La Nouvelle-France in 1762 and then the Spanish Empire when Spain became a republic in 1776.\n\nIn 1770, a ship carrying 300 British Royal Marines landed and soon a small fort was constructed. In 1855 the fort was enlarged and converted into a navy shipyard. In 1911 Jacksonville's shipbuilding industry started to grow rapidly. Jacksonville became first a shipping port, and later Jacksonville evolved into a second world city. After the American Civil War, Jacksonville was a major producer of ships. The shipyard became the Navy's premier shipbuilding center. Jacksonville was founded on a swamp. Its history was shaped by sea battles, wars, and earthquakes. As the city grew in population, much of Jacksonville's original residential area was developed. For more than three decades, Jacksonville's population grew at a rate much faster than that in most of the country. In the 1920s and early thirties, Jacksonville was designated the most beautiful city in America, and it remained so until the mid-1960s, when the hurricane of 1964 caused serious damage to the city's infrastructure and forced a large-scale realignment of the city's layout. The city continued to enjoy record growth during the next 35 years. It became a national", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "Eric Frederiksen | Gaming Reviews & News byI try to remain impartial here, but whenever there is a really exciting new video game or movie, i go out of my way to go to their official site or go to their press releases just to get all the information they give out. In this instance i’ll be mentioning it as it relates to Dark Souls I know it’s not the best series out there by a long shot just yet, but i’ll make it a point to discuss as much of the game as could be in this one.\n\nNow Dark Souls is in stores now for both PS3 and 360, the game came out last year May of 2008, and with such success from the game and its creators, it is still a topic of debate as to when the series is a good or bad series and what would be the best way to pick this title over other ones out on the market as of today (June).\n\nDark Soul\nGame: Souls\nDeveloper: From Software\n\nWhat’s so special that we should all take notice on Dark Souls, since i’m not going to spoil it for you, let’s just say it is truly a special game when you get into it.\n\nFrom Software has been making games and they really had something new to offer with an RPG with many open-world exploration and character development that the series was never before put out and with gameplay that is a blast to play through.\n\nWe have to talk a lot in regards to the story and how from Software have created such a deep and amazing storyline that i’d really like to go into it and elaborate on it as much as possible, but that would take a little far for this review.\n\nNow when you pick up the game, you are on a dark world where the gods and demons reside and you must go through many stages along the way to gain the items and tools necessary to fight and defeat these evil spirits or as we call them “demons”. Many of the demons you fight are quite large and have huge bodies, so you have to learn and practice to be able to fight them without getting overpowered since it is part of the story to learn of course.\n\nAlong the way through the game you have to learn of course and gain the tools to get out of the demons’ way and gain power in order to protect and guard yourself from the demons that reside on this harsh and dark world. Along the way you find loot to use as currency and more, but also need to fight some bosses that are large enough to need to use it as ammunition, and if you do hit one it is pretty hard to stop since it will almost instantly knock you out.\n\nThe weapons are also fairly huge and look impressive in their appearance and size.\n\nAs of now i’ve not yet played as many games as many people have, but the things that i’ve seen that others have noted, that seems to be the case many times are the size of enemies, like demons, or like in Dark Souls they are large and have huge bodies so they don’t seem to just disappear when you hit them but instead move around and hit you, and when you do hit one you’re almost instantly knocked out since they are fast moving and you can’t get out in time. This also shows how slow the animations are, but we’ll talk about that in a later review.\n\nThe animations while you are playing the game are very funny to watch, they are very slow, and the characters seem very human and sometimes even animated, it was something that i think was necessary for the game to be enjoyable and a good amount of fun to play, i’ve heard some things that it is some times a bit clunky from being in this fast paced action game and i’m sure that i’m wrong about that since many people may find it really enjoyable and a lot of fun, but i’ll still keep things in mind for future use.\n\nNow along back to the story. The story in Dark Souls takes place in the very same world that we are still in at this time, but now we see it from many different angles and perspectives. The opening sequence is that of the main story as you are the only survivor of a small village and see it in the way that you have seen it at a time many years ago.\n\nOnce you get out of this town, you get a new life and new memories, you travel to another village that you find is in the exact same situation, until you meet a group of young teens who seem to remember the same thing as you and have a completely different life going on in comparison to you, which you quickly discover that you are the same person who started with this group and they may have even grown up in another village, and it is then that you get into a bit of a fight with them, one", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "Southern California is home to Los Angeles International Airport, the world’s third-busiest. It was the hub for Boeing 707s from 1970 to 2001 (and the last 747 retired there, in 2004) and now hosts Boeing 777s (with about 8,000 a year). It hosts Boeing 737s (with about 1,100 a year), and new 737s have a long shelf-life: in 2017, the plane that delivered a Boeing 787 Dreamliner to the factory in Everett, Washington, was still flying seven years later.\n\nThe airport’s location in the L.A./Orange county corridor has made it a magnet for commercial aircraft from around the globe. While passenger traffic was rising in the last part of the 20th century, it was not the same as it once was because of a shift in where the world’s biggest economies were based: East Asia.\n\nThere are few cities on earth where air traffic has grown more dramatically over the past 50 years than in and around LAX. In 1965, Los Angeles had about 18 air traffic controllers at once – all of them busy with aircraft headed to and from Los Angeles. By 2014, there were 742 controllers and all but 36 were dedicated to LAX. More than one-third of air traffic was handled by people who had been in that position as pilots, but who now also work in other careers.\n\n“It’s a unique, interesting beast,” said John Nance, chief executive of air traffic control in Los Angeles since 2005, who took over because of a conflict with Boeing. “We take in the majority of the aircraft, but we also have a lot of aircraft in the air ready to land. The question is, what do we do with them afterwards? We’ve been trying to automate to get that data away from the air traffic controller, but not everything’s automated. If you have a Boeing 777-300 sitting on the runway with engines running, where should it go? There’s more than one way to do that.”", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "been funded in part at least by cuts to tax credits for low- and middle-income families.\n\nAs the new figures indicate, the deficit is being driven upwards in the United States - even as the United Kingdom attempts desperately to put its finances in order.\n\nThe UK still has huge problems to sort out. The Coalition government has given a massive blank cheque to a private sector that needs strong oversight and government to deal with the debt crisis - and they are only going to dig themselves in deeper for the sake of the present government and its supporters in the media.\n\nFor as David Cameron pointed out, even now our deficits are falling because borrowing to repair our banks will eventually be offset by public spending cuts. The government insists that it has \"a plan to balance the budget by 2018-19\" though that statement is being challenged by the likes of George Osborne.\n\nDespite a record £12.4 billion in spending cuts the Bank of England announced last week, David Cameron promised this week that it is being used to plug holes in the deficit budget - the main reason public services have been slashed in recent years.\n\nHowever, the numbers in the UK Treasury are being used to justify government budget cuts, as the UK government continues to ignore the fact that while we may have the financial strength of the world's second largest economy there are several problems that will need more attention than fiscal rectitude. A large swathe of the economy is suffering from a combination of stagnant pay, a jobless rate of just over 8 per cent, a falling unemployment rate, and house prices where £1,000,000 is not even worth a lot less than the £500,00 we paid for our home in the 1990s.\n\nThe government is also continuing to fiddle with tax credits on the taxpayer's behalf for the benefits that have gone into the hands of a small- and medium-sized company run by a small number of middle men, with the result that the Treasury is left with a large deficit from which it will be difficult to recover under the spending cuts introduced so far.\n\nThe UK government has been heavily criticised for the role that private firms are using credit and government loans to make investment decisions as an alternative to their employees - even though there is evidence the profits made by the big public sector lenders have dropped by billions for the first time in a decade as borrowing at banks went up as a share of the economy.\n\nAs George Osborne said today, the Conservative party has been \"working throughout the government to ensure we don't get into a situation where an emergency loan bill keeps growing for years to come.\n\n\"We understand that this is extremely difficult, and it doesn't mean we can't take responsibility for our debts by setting the right priorities.\"\n\nBut the government's response to the mounting threat of a Greek exit from the Euro has been to slash tax credits for lower-earning families on the pretext that we need to avoid \"a massive Greek default\" and to reduce other welfare in order to reduce welfare spending.\n\nIt's an old trick from the left and the right to try and blame austerity on the poor, but the truth is that while austerity makes them angry they are not the ones to suffer the consequences. They will continue to receive a big pay-back as those who have been given handouts by the state can make the most of the new money. But most of the population will suffer because the private sector in Britain will get just one big pay-off from the new growth while the government's deficit will go up, further straining the public budgets of the working class.\n\nIt also goes without saying that they in the media are happy to blame any misfortune they see upon the state, because they can then blame it on the Tories as well and hope for a bigger share of the profits of privatisation. However what is important to remember is that the privatisation of the last government has been nothing to show but good results, with the privatisation of the banking sector in particular providing a return on investment of £120 billion.\n\nThe government will no doubt blame the government's own deficit on their cuts, but they will not go so far as to say that they are reducing the deficit - even with the cuts being rolled out for the rest of the country by government departments in a last-gasp attempt to save the rest of the public sector budgets. What the British ruling class cannot tolerate is another payback for the cuts. They also fear a class war being instigated by the working class that they cannot control - they are the ones to benefit from class war.", "label": "gptneo"}

Well, we’ll tell you. It’s the very same kind of insight our world needs now more than ever. When you understand the world, you understand humanity. When you understand humans, things get better. With your very own hand in the game, you become the hero. The hand you were born with, but with a few key modifications – it becomes something other than you.\n\n“It’s the perfect blend of fiction and fact.” – Jeff Goldblum\n\nMy name is David Hines, a.k.a. ‘The King of the Science Fiction Film’, and I’m an alien from outer space. I am the Chosen One of the universe, the Godfather of all Alien Races, in fact. I am the ultimate and most wanted, and therefore, the most popular alien in the universe. It has been 20 years since the events of ‘Aliens on a Spaceship’, and the universe has once again undergone major changes, with a whole new alien race at war with itself. The ‘Kaiju’ invasion – that shook our world to its core and has forever changed the face of the planet. And, that is the reason, why I am writing this book – a book to help you understand what’s going on in our world.\n\nWhen you know what’s going on, you have power. What you don’t have power of, is a complete understanding of it. If you don’t have this understanding – like I said – you’re not a true hero. The world has seen some rough times, but what is happening now, is anything but the ‘bad guys’. They are simply your neighbours, and your co-workers; some you have had for decades, others in less than a day. You are at the forefront of the changes, but you have no idea what is to come.\n\nIf you do, you will find that what you’ve imagined is nothing more of what is to come.\n\nIf you are at the forefront of the changes, you can change the world. The future will never look the same in your face. It will never be you.\n\nThis book is for you, that dreamer. It is so simple, so you can use it to help make the world a better place – for those around you; and to leave you with an amazing story!\n\nMy name is Matt Stone and I’m the main character of a book.\n\nThis is called ‘Gemworld’ and written by me, Matt Stone.\n\nWe both had a few lives, before, we met. I was a writer, and he was a gamer. My life was more interesting than his, and it all changed when I became his friend. I started off as his main character’s greatest secret: That he was an alien from outer space. Now don’t get me wrong, we never discussed that part of who I was, but I took a little bit of my character into his and said, “Well… I’m an alien from outer space too”. Even though, it wasn’t something I even thought about. We were just two friends who played videogames.\n\nIf you had asked me then, what I thought he was, I would have called him “a bit strange”. I didn’t like the term strange – it gave me a weird feeling. I would have said that I think people usually think strange, but I didn’t like the weird – it gave me a weird feeling. In order to explain my weirdness, Matt was, at first, only a game character. Then, we started to spend more time, and we became friends. I liked him because he was an alien. He wasn’t a human character. But then, something weird started to happened. We went from being just friends to being friends, to being more than friends. We started to look after each other – our friendship turned into something more.\n\nAll of this started to happen when we realised that I was an alien. This wasn’t something that was ever mentioned by Matt – but, it soon became obvious to me, that was my most defining characteristic. How do alien cultures look and behave? Their culture – even with aliens – doesn’t necessarily look like ours – how do they behave? What does our culture look and behave like?

I didn't make it home to see it yet because there was this awful storm raging outside, and the streets were dangerous, so I spent the night watching movies on the screen.\n\nI've been wanting one for over 10 years, and I finally picked up my copy for Christmas from Amazon and I absolutely can not WAIT to play it. I'll probably be getting it in about two weeks I think in like a month and the only thing that's bugging me is I really want to make a copy of the last 30 minutes or so or the beginning to watch with my wife. I've seen it like 2-3 times, usually it's like the whole thing and I get bored really quickly (not this time).\n\nI remember it had the new movie poster on it. I didn't see it until a few hours earlier. I was going to go out when my wife and I were going out to dinner that night, and I was in the middle of buying another gift when we got home. I was watching my Amazon purchase and saw it. I wasn't planning on trying it out tonight, but I just couldn't pass it up. I love all the songs, and it really is a great movie. We had a great time and it was very different from anything I've seen. I really recommend it.\n\nMy daughter found this movie on a list of \"new\" things she wanted to see. It was new at the time, and she wanted to give it a try. I'd like to try it, but really do think it's at the top of things I have to see.\n\nIt was so sweet and funny that I completely forgot to even put the remote on when it came on.\n\nSo excited to see how this one goes! I really really want to see it, especially when the last scene shows her saying \"I love you, Daddy\" to Dad and him getting really angry at her for something so silly.\n\nI really want to see how this one ends. I feel like it's gonna end really great.\n\nAnd, to be perfectly honest, I really really want to see how this one ends. I love how it ends: she gets knocked up by a guy. I love her so much. But I don't want to see it end. I just know. And also, the ending was so funny! There's so many crazy things that could happen and they don't because \"the little girl\" wants to have her cake and eat it too. :P\n\nThe soundtrack was awesome. When you start to recognize certain songs, you listen to them a few more times before just hearing them over and over and over again. Especially with the new album 'Uncle Kracker'.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to put this out there:\n\nThe \"making out\" scene was hot. I remember when I was 14 and my friend and I were making out when my friend mentioned that she really wanted to do this and I didn't think she could be serious. But, it was just her. We watched a movie that was supposed to be pretty heavy (because it had an older sister), but I found myself in a different room the whole time. It made me really sad that we had to watch that stupid movie, but we did anyways. It was just cute and sweet.\n\nIt's all about that love. The love for the child, the love for the mother, the love for her husband.\n\nI also really really want to see how her mother behaves at the end because it makes me so sad that we have to leave this movie. :S\n\nI have high expectations because this was the first I've seen the film myself and I'm not usually one for a huge spoiler or anything.\n\nBUT.

{"text": "DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about greed and corruption—just brutal enough to be a movie, and bloody enough to have a good plot; you’re going to have to see it the movie first. Its protagonist, Philippe, runs his father’s company, and soon has his sights set on the biggest company in the world: Nestlé. His father (Pascal Greggory) gives him a choice: he can marry his current love, the beautiful and rich Nathalie (Monique Duparcot), or go into partnership with Nestlé and become the CEO of the company. That’s enough of the setup. It’s the business, stupid. Philippe is an ambitious bastard, and to be honest, the thing he wants most in life is money. So what if it kills him?\n\nAfter running Nestlé for three years to become its CEO, Philippe’s plans change when he takes a call from a mysterious man named Monsieur Dreyfus (Michel Serrault), who tells him he is to receive an offer from a secret account of Nestlé. In that account is a $100 million investment from a man named Guillaume, who needs Philippe to find a mysterious piece of metal with a code which no one can figure out, and which will make him more than a million dollars, maybe more. Philippe doesn’t believe him, but agrees to see the guy. He agrees to meet up, but not with Dreyfus: Dreyfus and his team are already gone; they have been replaced by two young guys hired by Philippe.\n\nBut as Philippe is taken to meet his old mentor, the one who fired him for taking the company into an investment, he discovers Nestlé is owned by his father, who has hidden away $800,000 in an account of funds to pay for the building of a new distribution center for Nestlé. Philippe tells his father he believes his company is a better idea, and he will stay with the company and run it for his father as well. The company is bought for $1,200 a share, $100 million. It’s just the beginning for Philippe. After the acquisition, Dreyfus sends his young men to the building site, where he orders all the workers to dig up the money from the company’s building and burn it.\n\nPhilippe and his father then meet with a lawyer to arrange for a transfer of funds from the account at the center for the company; the money is given to a company clerk working for Philippe that day. Philippe is to stay there and serve his father as CEO and make the money, and once that has been done, the company’s shares will be put up for sale. The board members will have a new buyer, all the assets will be sold, and the money will disappear with Dreyfus.\n\nHe is a monster, that Dreyfus.\n\nIt’s a simple setup, with plenty of plot twists and plenty of action: it has been known for movies and TV to end badly, with an unsatisfied audience. But even the most simple of plot setups has its flaws, and this one has plenty of them. The entire story is just about Philippe vs. Dreyfus with only a hint of who the other man is. It is well acted—but not enough—it just isn’t compelling enough to make you care. In fact, I left the theater thinking: why bother?\n\nThere is another plot twist left in, which is only hinted at but which can be guessed only by the audience. The last quarter of the film is just about money, and its the one where you will get the most. And yes, that is the thing that has been holding this movie back: if it didn’t have that, it might have been better. It is this money thing that makes this movie the more compelling and exciting, in my opinion. It makes it the more effective. This is why I left the theater thinking “Why bother?”\n\nThe movie is directed by Julien Londres and written by Jean-Marie Larqué. The movie was filmed from September 2, 1990 to October 2, 1990. The cast is Jean-Pierre Léaud (Philippe), Monique Duparcot (Nathalie), Michel Serrault (Monsieur Dreyfus, Philippe’s father), Louis Malle (Monsieur Dreyfus), Luc Piret (Guillaume), Caroline Laffite (Mme Lothaire), and Gérard Depardieu (Gérard Dubus).\n\nThe music is by Michel Colombier, the lyrics are by Philippe Leroux, and the film was produced by the French subsidiary of Warner Bros.\n\nThe film premiered in New York City on September 8", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "background : timely access to cardiovascular health services is necessary. Further steps to overcome this barrier included addressing a lack of awareness of the CVD risk score by promoting its use and its importance. This might have occurred through mass media (publicly, through the internet, and so on), mass education campaigns, or by training health professionals or the public on the CVD risk profile. Inclusion of a CVD risk score in the patient\\'s first cardiology encounter may have been the means to achieve this. At present, our data did not enable us to quantify the proportions of patients or practitioners who are aware of CVD risk and have the correct patient record, which is the first step in reducing this barrier.\n\nOur study has some limitations. First, the retrospective nature of the data collection introduced recall bias, as the data were collected only from records in this institution. However, this might have had a limited effect on our study findings, as we used a data collection template that was specifically designed to collect the type and number of CVD risk assessment tests performed over the study period. The patients\\' records had been reviewed routinely with the review of the template\\'s audit tool and audit tool\\'s checks to ensure data completeness and consistency. Second, our analyses involved only 10 hospitals. This allowed us to analyse data from across a wide range of hospitals in England, including large and small community hospitals and teaching hospital sites; however, it is possible that the findings are not generalisable to hospitals outside these. Third, there is no 'Gold Standard' system for CVD risk assessment, which is the cornerstone of establishing the CVD risk category from which the CVD risk score was calculated in this study. The choice of our benchmark was made a priori, based on the evidence based guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology to determine the CVD risk-assessed heart failure (HF) risk category,^[@R26]^ and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) CVD risk score tool for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.^[@R27]^ These systems are based on using the Framingham criteria (age, gender, smoking) in combination with risk factors,^[@R27][@R28]^ except for those who are over age 75 and those with diabetes mellitus (see [online supplementary table III](#SP1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} for details, available at [online supplementary table 5](#SP1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). However, both systems have some limitations, including the potential for patients classified as having higher CVD risk (≥10%) to have either no CVD risk or high CVD risk (≥20%) from one risk assessment tool,^[@R27]^ and the potential for the CVD risk score to be overestimated from a single CVD risk assessment done without a repeat evaluation.^[@R29]^\n\n10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011134.supp1\n\n10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011134.supp2\n\nAs we were not able to do population-based analyses to evaluate the validity of the results for these patients, we chose to focus on hospital cohorts with well documented CVD risk profiles. However, as there was no gold standard system for risk classification, any results seen for patients who were wrongly classified could be viewed as potentially problematic.\n\nIn summary, most patients with known cardiovascular risk profile who had an admission for HF in one month had moderate level of CVD risk profile, according to published guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology. Our findings would suggest that most patients were well-educated on the importance of CVD risk factors and that they received some or all of their CVD risk assessments using the Framingham CVD risk score. Our findings emphasise the use of the Framingham CVD risk score for the risk assessment of HF admissions, and highlight the need for improved education around CVD risk assessment for people at risk of CVD.\n\nSupplementary Material\n======================\n\n###### Reviewer comments\n\n###### Author\\'s manuscript\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the contribution of the following: the clinicians involved in the care of patients discharged from one of the centres involved; the ward nurses who performed CVD risk management in the hospital; and the patient and public involvement members from both public and medical professional sectors.

After they were alone, Williams asked him twice, Edwards said he asked on the third try and then left. \"I then tried to call him to tell him that I didn't do it,\" Edwards said.\n\nWilliams eventually arrived at the flat but Edwards said his nephew went to sleep in the room with Williams. \"He wanted to be alone,\" he said.\n\nThat night when Edwards was talking on the phone, his nephew called him to tell him that Williams had made a sexual advance at the back of the flat and also that his 16-year-old niece had gone to bed. ''He said he would kill her,'' Edwards said. Later that night when Williams went to Edwards' flat, he said he had his own problems to contend with because his 16-year-old daughter was in bed and he could not do anything because the lights were on.

{"text": "Only one of nine expert witnesses approached did not want to comment.\n\nThe other witnesses, also selected by the Justice Department, defended the practice as legally legitimate — for the most part. The lawyers for the Defense Department, meanwhile, described the process as “fair.” Yet in court interviews all agreed on very few details: namely, that only one of nine expert witnesses was told which witnesses to approach and which to avoid. Even the lawyers for the Justice Department acknowledged that many of the experts, many of them from academic institutions, were not qualified.\n\nThe prosecution’s central premise is that it is possible to manipulate facts in order to get an innocent person to plead guilty. The question is why does the FBI have a hand in that process?\n\nAn examination of the records the Justice Department provided to the Court, along with the information gleaned from dozens of interviews with people involved in the case, as well as interviews with experts and researchers, raises more problems than answers. But some of these answers can at least be gleaned.\n\nThe FBI’s main concern — that is, the central question in this case — has to do with two concepts that have been explored by federal, state, and academic experts.\n\nThe first concerns the FBI’s use of the federal guidelines to determine which expert witnesses to approach and which to avoid. The rationale for this policy is that an expert witness “would know almost by definition whom he would be able to testify favorably on behalf of Mr. [Bryant]. An expert should certainly not be a witness for Mr. [Bryant] or for the defense,” said Michael Wessel, the former FBI agent who prosecuted the case.\n\nIndeed, Wessel said, “[y]ou wouldn’t want to give the guy who’s going to be the prosecution’s expert a chance to cross-examine the guy who’s going to be Mr. [Bryant’s] expert.”\n\nWessel’s logic is that such cross-examinations might reveal that the expert witness on the prosecution’s side of the case has an inherent bias. But the premise is implausible, since the experts who have been selected — and approved — have no apparent bias against the defense. In the vast majority of these cases, the expert witness has even defended the prosecution from the outset.\n\nThe second concept under scrutiny is a longstanding FBI practice in which a confidential informant can persuade an individual to commit an act that would help his or her case.\n\nThe tactic has been used in numerous cases throughout history. One example: that of Anna E. Blaszczyk. In 2011, the federal prosecutors working on the case against Anna Blaszczyk, a Polish woman, asked her husband, a former postal worker in Wisconsin, to send their 15-year-old daughter back to Poland, where she feared she would be kidnapped by organized crime. The husband was a witness for the the prosecution at Anna’s trial, and, according to testimony in the case, agreed to help.\n\nHe sent his daughter to a third country. She then mailed her letters — in English — to her father, suggesting they had an understanding. She even enclosed an English-language note to his ex-wife. “It really sounded like she really loved him,” explained Dr. Blaszczyk’s lawyer, Michael Wierzynek. The prosecution, Wierzynek added, “knew they were getting good value for money with this deal, and they were doing it again.”\n\nThe letters, she included, gave evidence of her innocence.\n\nThe strategy proved to be a dead end.\n\nIn 2013, Anna’s husband was indicted — but convicted of a misdemeanor after an appeal — for allegedly using his role in his daughter’s scheme to persuade her to mail a letter to her former husband.\n\nAnd although it might be argued that the prosecution had the “right” to try her husband, she now contends: “The FBI lied … the FBI did not use their power for the purpose for which they were intended and violated Anna’s equal protection rights.”\n\nThe FBI also says it is not against the law to lie. Indeed, according to Wessel, “anybody in their right mind can tell a witness, ‘You’re not credible,’ and they could go arrest their next victim.\n\n“It’s not going to stop them,” he said. “It’s a very sophisticated tool.”\n\nFBI agents who have worked the case said they were shocked by the tactics used to ensnare Anna and her former husband. “It’s a lie, a total,” said Agent Charles Allen", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "we study unlimited infinite churn in peer - to - peer settings with a large number and type of transactions.\n\nThe data that we have from both the academic perspective and the real world is that:\n\n1) Users do not like the idea of always knowing that their money goes nowhere - there is very little motivation to stick with.\n2) That has to change.\n\nThe peer to peer model is the model that will change peoples behaviour.\n\nHere I should make a special note about block reward reductions, as I believe this is what is creating both the incentives and the friction that we are starting to observe.\n\nYou'll notice that the chart above shows two different behaviours. In the top half, one transaction is sent every 1000 blocks. In the bottom half, one transaction is sent every 500 blocks. In the second half-way, one transaction is sent every 1000 blocks. However, in the first half-way, it is more than 1000 times more likely that one transaction is sent, and it is more than 1000 times less likely that one transaction will be received. So, this is also a reduction in block reward.\n\nWe know that the peer to peer model increases the number of transactions and lowers the block reward. The question remains therefore, how much of this increase in 'transaction volume' can be attributed to reduction in block reward?\n\nBy comparison, the increase in transaction volume in Bitcoin is very much reduced compared to Bitcoin Cash.\n\nLet's continue to consider our Bitcoin example. With one transaction every 1000 blocks - that is, there are no blocks of any significance for 1000 blocks - there is no benefit of increased transaction volume. With one transaction every 500 blocks - that is, the amount of blocks that have a single transaction is the block size is less, but the amount of transactions that can be processed is significantly above normal - the block reward is significantly reduced- then the increase in the number of transactions and the change in incentive becomes very significant indeed.\n\nOf course we could also say that the block reward should be the market value of the Bitcoin.\n\nWith one transaction every 1000 blocks - that is, there is no incentive to generate any new transactions and create any'real' value in the system - it simply becomes a 'cost of use' - the block reward reduces to what it was previously.\n\nWith one transaction every 1000 blocks - that is, block reward is 0 - users just don't have the incentive for creating a lot of transactions- and the transaction market value goes down.\n\nWith one transaction every 1000 blocks - that is, one transaction costs 0- there is an incentive for one transaction - but no incentive for more.\n\nWhen blocks have 100+ transactions, the block reward is reduced significantly - for an overall increase in transaction volume of 1000x, the block reward is reduced by 1000x.\n\nWhen blocks have 10+ transactions, or even one transaction in each 1000 blocks, the block reward reduction is much less.\n\nWhen blocks have 1 in 1000, 1 in 100, 1 in 15,1 in 3,1 in 5 - the block reward is reduced by 1 in 15=25%,1 in 1000, 1 in 1000, 1 in 1000, 1 in 1000.\n\nWhat you can notice by reducing the block reward by even one per thousand, is the incentive to create the minimum number of transactions. When there is no incentive - then the incentive to send thousands of transactions per day is also zero.\n\nIn effect, even a slight reduction in the block reward is enough to completely remove the incentive for many users - in fact even a 5% reduction in the block reward creates no incentive for creating thousands of transactions.\n\nThis is only going to affect the overall user adoption of the network at the start because of the incentive reduction that we have already discussed above.\n\nPeer nodes and block producers only start out having incentive to produce blocks without peer nodes. They simply start out generating blocks that have zero-one zero-one transactions.\n\nPeer to Peer is a much more complex mechanism than Bitcoin Block Times in general.\n\nIn general, there is no reason an individual block producer would want to slow down the transaction or block time. On the other hand, they do have an incentive to not have as many transactions processed in a block in order to increase the block reward - but how this is going to work depends on the model.\n\nIn theory this could happen as follows:\n\n1) One transaction is broadcast, the block producer looks to see if there are any unread transactions. If it does not find anything, the new block needs to be accepted.\n\nThis is where we are starting to see a reduction in the block reward to zero.\n\n2) Then with one transaction, one block is produced and then the number of unread transactions are checked. If they are 0 or less, accept the block. Otherwise wait for the next block to generate.\n\nOnce again", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "I was surprised that \"\" Forgiving the Franklins \"\" did a review of the film at its premiere screening, with its conclusion that the film was \"a real contender to become the next big thing in film\"\" (\"The Hollywood Reporter\"). The same reviewer went on to rave in regards to the film, saying that \"\" Forgiving the Franklins \"\" \"loved this film, and wanted nothing but good things to say about it. And if you do care to know more about what I did do to get a very decent review published in a pretty mainstream press (and to have my name attached to it on the review page!) here's what I did: I actually wrote two reviews that I put forward in the same breath, one under a pseudonym, the one that was printed in the \"The Hollywood Reporter\"...the other under my real name? I really don't understand his reasoning, as I'd hate for my name to be attached to this as well...? However, I had a great time doing this with my kids, and seeing their reactions when these films we love were being covered, I really think this is the best possible way to give the credit and recognition to these films they long for: when they see their name being attached to a piece of work.\n\nThe \"The Hollywood Reporter\" is only one of many reputable publications that have reviewed this film, both in print and online. My friends in and around the \"Hollywood Reporter\" have been very happy to hear that I was a part of this review, and they're happy to put me to work. Here's an excerpt from the \"Hollywood Reporter\" review of the film at its premiere screening, the reviewer says this about the film:\n\nIt's hard to tell if \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" is more touching than \"A Christmas Story\" but it's at least a little more than that.\n\nIt's not a traditional musical that's sure to bring a grin to the viewer's face but when we're talking about how to get more children to come see our movies, this is definitely a movie that's worth seeing.\n\nIt's a movie you'll remember long after the lights come on but when the kids ask \"Daddy where were the elves?\" a \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" could be the answer you'll like most.\"\n\nI think this reviewer clearly misjudged the film, which is fine: I don't care too much for the Christmas story as a movie, but it is certainly a worthy follow-up to A Christmas Story. The way I saw it when I reviewed the film at its premiere at the Film Festival, with the \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" review getting published in the \"The Hollywood Reporter\" about its premiere, the movie I am most happy to be able to know is how to get more children to see our movies. And I know that once \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" was out, it would make my job to have more people watching our movie possible.\n\n\"Forgive Me, Franklin\" is definitely one of my favorites from 2012 and hopefully the last one that I will not see, as I still have work to do on one of my favorite films from 2012. But I know it will be hard to watch it out of fear of getting angry at it, as I was almost angry when I heard it was a movie we could find in our children's schools as a teaching tool to be taught when children see it with the rest of the works of the Christmas movie. And I hope many people will finally realize the potential in \"Forgive Me, Franklin\", even if \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" is something that only children can love.\n\nAbout a year ago, it was a great feeling to know that I helped bring together a film festival, where one of our favorite movies, our new favorite movie \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" would be screened, and would also get the attention of someone who actually knew about the \"Forgive Me, Franklin\" film. When I went to my friend and former co-worker's house to do his last minute birthday party plans (for the third or maybe fourth time!), I could not bring myself to have one of my friends over and watch \"Forgive Me, Franklin\", but I have to admit that what drove me into helping to prepare this screening at the Film Festival was the fact that I wanted to find out more about how the film got its name...\n\nWhen I worked for film, I always felt that I was one part of the film industry, the one who was the one who was behind the movies. Now, that role was taken so by the young children who love the work that their films do, and now they will be the ones who can name it when this one is on the table.\n\nBut when I look back to my first job at \"Babylon Films\", there where many films that brought a smile to a parent's face and that they would be proud to give to others as well.

{"text": "human and mouse skin accumulate senescent cells in both the proliferative and reparative epidermis, it is clear that these two systems are not identical.[@cit0045]\n\nEpiDentin is produced from a common precursor, amelogenin. All mammalian amelogenins have a single zinc-binding domain, and when the zinc is removed, the polypeptide chain shortens, resulting in the formation of the amelogenin protein.[@cit0046] The amelogenins are encoded by a gene cluster comprised of seven genes, *A3*, *A4*, *A5*, *A6*, *A7*, *A8*, and *A10*, which are highly conserved across mammalian species. Each amelogenin gene is transcribed from a separate promoter, but together they form a larger polycistronic transcript. In addition to a single zinc-binding domain, the core polypeptide of each amelogenin has a glycine-rich domain that is rich in serine and threonine residue-containing hydrophobic amino acids [@cit0046]; this domain stabilizes the polypeptide in the absence of zinc. The glycine-rich domain mediates amelogenin monomers polymerization into dimers and tetramers, which further aggregate into hexamers and octamers.[@cit0046] Amelogenin is then secreted through a specialized secretion pathway that shares many features with the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein trafficking pathway that drives the trafficking of proteins from the cytosol to the lumen of the ER into the cell.[@cit0047] In vitro the hexameric assembly is formed from two zinc-free amelogenins that are co-incubated at low pH.[@cit0046] The hexameric amelogenin aggregate is then separated from the precursor monomers in a process that requires both calcium and ATP. This unique structural organization allows the secretion of amelogenins into the extracellular milieu via a multimeric oligomeric form.[@cit0046]\n\nThe process by which amelogenins are secreted from their respective gene promoters in a coordinated fashion is only partially understood. Mutation experiments have shown that the zinc-binding domain is necessary for transcription, while the glycine-rich domain appears to be dispensable for either the initial promoter activation or correct mRNA splicing in all six genes.[@cit0048] Further investigation shows that the zinc-binding domain acts as a transcription activation domain in the A3 gene, but not in the A4, A5, A6, A8, or A10 genes.[@cit0048] Furthermore, the transcription factors that drive gene transcription in the keratinocytes of mammalian skin are yet to be identified.\n\nAfter secretion the amelogenin polypeptide-polymer aggregate must be translocated into the extracellular matrix (ECM) through a specialized proteolytic complex ([Fig. 1](#f0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}) that involves a transmembrane glycoprotein named meprin, a serine protease named furin, and a host of metalloproteases.[@cit0049] The initial interaction between the meprin transmembrane glycoprotein and meprin α (meprin α) and β (meprin β), both of which associate at the cell surface, is mediated by specific amino acid epitopes within the ectodomain of meprin α [@cit0051] ([Fig. 2A](#f0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}) [@cit0046]. Once secreted, the meprin transmembrane glycoproteins are bound by the surface proteins mafA and mafB. These surface membrane proteins regulate meprin translocation, cell-matrix adhesion, cell shape, and cell migration.[@cit0049] Figure 2.Lateral migration of keratinocytes through their ECM. (A) Meprin (meprin α or meprin β) and furin (frizzled/A-type) enzymes form a proteolytic complex that cleaves the precursor amelogenin to yield the mature amelogenins.

{"text": "the purpose of this study was to compare kinetic differences between a conventional extracorporeal centrifuge and an extracorporeal cell centrifuge.\n\nTwo groups of patients have been studied: in the group of 5 patients with severe congestive heart failure, a pump was implanted for the treatment of chronic heart failure. From the first three patients the pump could be removed without any complications in 5 and from the fourth patients this was possible with minor difficulties in the fifth. In the six patients who had the pump removed from their hearts in the course of the study, these were: after their first pump implantation, in the fourth patient.\n\nResults\n\nA centrifuge can be described as a closed system of a rotor, a drive shaft and a vessel which allows it to be filled and emptied to any desired extent. The vessel and the rotor itself are usually made of plastic with a heat stabilizing layer of polyurethane or similar material on both surfaces. The rotor is driven about its own axis by a drive shaft whose axis is connected to a rotor-fixed counter shaft. Inside the rotor is a hollow cylindrical rotor shaft about which passes the drive shaft. The rotors, which can be as large as 200 mm in diameter, are made of plastic or rubber and can be made of many different materials.\n\nWhen the rotor has reached a specific rotational speed by the centrifugal force of the fluid in the vessel, it has stopped for a moment, and on reversing the rotation by rotating the drive shaft, the vessel is emptied (if the speed is below 100 revolutions per minute) and will return to its full filling condition by the rotation of its drive shaft when the drive shaft is rotated through the same number of revolutions. It is important to note that only a very high speed of rotation (over 100 rev. per minute) will stop the vessel completely. At this high speed, however, blood will be completely stopped inside the rotation vessel in the shortest possible time.\n\nThe most efficient centrifuge may be used only if there is sufficient water- and electrolyte-stored capacity. The fluid can be pumped into the rotor tank, or a liquid can be pumped into the vessel by means of a pump connected to the drive shaft.\n\nA rotor that is used in a centrifuge is often made by winding steel wire in a spiral from the outer to the inner coil, with opposite turns of wire in the core and spiral in the coils. The coiling takes place with the direction of the axis of the spiral winding of the rotor axis (longitudinal direction of the axis).\n\nThe length of the spiral is often chosen at the upper part of the coil near the central axis of the coil. The coil is then wrapped with an appropriate thickness of the wire. At the same time the thickness of the coil is chosen in such a way that the maximum radial deformation of the coil during a short period may be avoided, and that the amount of the coil is not distorted, due to a nonmetallic layer forming on the wire.\n\nA rotor that is used in a centrifuge may also be made by various other methods, such as:\n\nBy passing a thin and flexible wire through an aluminum tube whose both surfaces are covered with plastic and hardened\n\nFusion welding\n\nBy passing a thin and flexible wire through a tube of plastic (polyamide or polyurethane) which is covered from above by a coating of plastic. The plastic tube is usually connected to a metal core through soldering the tubes to the core, the plastic (polyamide or polyurethane) is then covered from above by a metal layer\n\nBy coating the pipe with a plastic (polyamide, polyurethane) from above. The plastic film is rolled on by the wire or a blade, by means of an air knife or with an abrasive disk.\n\nThese methods require a great expenditure of time and materials and the quality is not always uniform.\n\nBy means of a spiral with flat spiral walls, made by rolling the spiral metal wire into a spiral on the cylinder axis of the cylinder.\n\nBy passing a thin flexible wire through an aluminum tube which is surrounded from above by a plastic coating with a thickness greater than 0.01 mm. On the outer surface is printed, from front, a number corresponding to the size of the rotor diameter. The tube is connected to a central metal cylinder by means of soldering (this method requires much time and costs).\n\nFor the purposes of the following description:\n\n\"the distance between adjacent points along the axis of the loop, measured in the direction along the axis of the loop, between opposite sides of a coil of a spiral with flat spiral walls is known as \"corotational length\".\n\nthe radius of curvature of this coil of wire is known as \"conical curve radius\".\n\nif in this coil all points of the spiral have the same radius of curvature, the curve radius is known as \"dome", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "as food becomes an important part of modern life, a kind of \"modern luxury\", because it is more portable, it is lighter, and therefore much cheaper to transport and distribute, and yet it may offer less flavor. There are foods that are good for you and are good to eat, but that you may not prefer to eat, for reasons of health or cost. There are food that you like, you really enjoy eating, but that tastes strange when you eat it. You don't really want to eat it. One thing to note about modern convenience foods is that they have gotten so complex that most people do not know what their food is doing anymore. They do not know what is in a jar. They do not know how it's made and what it does, they do not know how any one is using it.\n\nEven the foods that we think people buy, like Coca Cola bottles with a few cans of soft ice cream inside, or Pepsi cola bottles with a few cans of cola, are not actually \"food\" at all. They are mere containers. They are merely containers for other foods. Coca cola puts corn syrup into their soda, so that we can drink the same carbonated liquid and get a pleasant taste, that we always get at home with Coke. Pepsi puts artificial color in their cola so that people think it tastes like Coke, when in fact it is made of a substance called maltodextrin, which doesn't have any carbon dioxide at all.\n\nSome food goes through many of these different processes. These food \"lifestyles\" are extremely difficult to keep in mind. They are not like cars, because a different part becomes a different quality with different usage. One is not made in some factory, one is made in a lot of small processes and lots of different pieces, all working together as one unit to make a whole that is good enough to eat. One is good enough to eat, not just food that is good to eat, but food to last through the years. It has to be kept in a refrigerator, without water, and without the addition of other chemicals to extend the shelf-life or to change the taste.\n\nFood is an incredibly complex system. Everything that goes into it from the smallest grain of wheat to the largest fish has to fit together in very specific ways. It takes all kinds of special enzymes, the chemistry of each chemical, the temperature and pressure of each process and the exact way that chemicals interact all in the right order to make the final product that is tasty and nutritious. Food is designed as a machine for maintaining life, the machine of the body.\n\nIf you look down the middle of a loaf of bread, at the middle there is a \"meat\" that a knife cannot cut through, it is called the center of the loaf, it is the piece of \"meat\" that you are eating. The rest of the loaf is \"milk\" or \"lard\", it is the fatty, not edible meat on which you are eating. The meat itself is the good stuff, the milk which makes the bread is the bad stuff : in order from the beginning to the end, there is a process to make a tasty whole, a process to make something that is actually a whole thing in itself. This process starts out really simple and is like something we do all the time; by adding all the ingredients together and then we have an awful and tasteless blob. Add water and we have a tasty cake, something that is good to eat, a delicious dessert or a delicious breakfast, like a sandwich or a cake and drink. It is very natural that we want more, and more always means the same thing: more. When you have more bread than you can ever eat, you use less of an ingredient that makes the most delicious bread: water. If you have as many breads as you can consume, you become so fat, that you lose the taste of the bread; you no longer like the bread, you just prefer the filling, because of the same reason that we prefer soda over water, that there isn't enough water in it to make us like it.\n\nWe see this process continually repeating, and it is the basis of all things, including food. Food must be eaten in time, so it can be prepared when the right time come and when the food is good to eat. Food that is too far out of date is no longer good to eat. Not to say that the food will be even less tasty when it is gone; it might not taste any different, but you will just hate it more. We all hate things that are gone: you want what is left of the sandwich that was too old. The bread is gone; you are hungry and you are glad of the taste of the filling which is better than any bread, still you hate the bread and want the filling to stop.\n\nThe process by which this \"Milk\" is created, the process by which you add", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "background : polycystic ovarian syndrome is one of the most common\nparaestheral disorders with an incidence of 3-5% that results in symptoms\nsuch as oligo-/anovulation, infertility, and irregular periods [9]. Symptoms\nof polycystic ovarian syndrome include hirsutism, hyperandrogenism and cysto-\ncrosis[8-10]. In menorrhagia\n(prolapse of the uterus), an enlarged uterus is visible on the pelvic front or is\ncaused by rupture of the uterus and a large amount of blood escapes, resulting\nin postmenopausal bleeding of a dark blood. Postmenopausal bleeding has been\nknown for being the most frequent and one of the most serious gynecological\ncomplication caused by pregnancy [12].\nDuring the early development of PCOS, high androgen production by the corpora\nlutea may lead to the development of cystic ovaries. This is associated with a\nluteal phase defect, i.e. a longer luteal phase and an insufficient production\nof progesterone. This results in increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue,\nhyperinsulinism and low estrogen levels. This also results in obesity,\nhyperinsulinemia, atherogenic insulin resistance, and polycystic ovarian\ntattoo. Other factors play roles in the development of cysto-crosis (cystitis)\ndue to bacterial infection, which may result in a chronic cystitis that may\nprogress and progress and may lead to cirrhosis and in the long term, to liver\ndestruction. For the treatment of a patient, both medical and non-medical therapy\nare recommended [9,10,17].\n\nTreatment with synthetic progestin is a method to reduce the ovulation and the\nperiodicity of menstruation. This method is an effective measure to treat\nmenorrhagia in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome with menstrual disorders\n[9,19-22]. This is due to reduction of progestogen secretion in the ovaries\n(treatment of the luteal phase defect) [23-27],\nalso reduction in the level of luteinizing hormone, which stimulates the\nproliferation of the corpora lutea, an increase in the progesterone of the\nfollicular phase and an increase in the progestogen [28].\nAfter the treatment, the irregular ovulation in the ovaries (polycystic ovary\nsyndrome) results in the reduction of the symptoms (menorrhagia) in the short\nterm and the maintenance of ovulation in the long term.\n\nAfter medical therapy, the treatment program often consists of therapy of the\novarian cysts, treatment of the increased intra-abdominal fat, lifestyle\nchanging, and hormonal replacement with oral progesterone-only therapy [16,20]. The\ntreatment of ovarian cysts during pregnancy is the third-line therapy. The\nfollowing procedures are generally considered:\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n--\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nTreatment with metformin (M)\nin polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) should begin during the early stage of the\ndevelopment of the disease [8,17]. It is used in patients treated with\ninsulin sensitizers. A meta-analysis revealed the following benefits: reduction\nof body weight (2.4 mmol/l), reduction of insulin level (0.31 mg/l), reduction of\nblood pressure (2.0 mmHg at systolic pressure and 0.2 mmHg at diastolic) [17]. With\nM, blood sugar metabolism does not change, therefore no additional weight\ngain takes place. Moreover, metformin significantly reduces the levels of\ninsulin but does not affect the levels of blood glucose and lipid profile[24].\nMetformin is used up to 500 mg twice a day. It is indicated in combination with\ninsulin therapy. The exact mechanism of metformin action on glucose\nmetabolism is not completely understood. It is known as a first-line insulin\nsensitizer, since it enhances the insulin sensitivity of cells and their\nproduction of glucose; thus, reduces the degree of hyperglycemia and improves\nblood glucose control. Metformin also reduces hyperinsulinemia and improves\nblood glucose control. Metformin does not decrease the level of blood\ninsulin, since insulin cannot be secreted at the level of the\nendometrial epithelia.

{"text": "background : the consumption of low quality foods is common, the main reason for doing so being a lack of knowledge on how to prepare and cook such foods. This is a common belief especially amongst students. In many cases, they do not even know how to prepare or cook any food. The reason is their choice for the most palatable food they can. They choose the most readily prepared foods which are the least healthy and economical. They believe that the most readily available foods are the most healthy and economical as opposed to complex recipes that take hours and cost a lot of money. Hence they choose that simple foods and do not prepare complex meals that take more hours/money. Most students simply choose their favorite fast foods because they are easy to prepare or consume and easy to consume.\n\nHence the main aim of the study was to evaluate knowledge and preferences for preparing and consuming foods among undergraduate students of IBA. In an effort to accomplish this aim, the study used the SERVOD format for measuring consumer knowledge, consumer preferences and also food choice.\n\n2. Materials and Methods {#sec2}\n========================\n\n2.1. Samples {#sec2.1}\n------------\n\nIBA\\'s undergraduate students, mostly students of Biology department, were selected for this study by visiting their Department and obtaining the consent. These students were selected on the basis that they were from a state college in the state of Karnataka, India, with about 50,000 students in the IBA. They were students in the Pre-Batch, Bachelor of Arts degree courses for 3 years. Each student was asked to sign a written consent form and was selected on the basis of having an interest in food and using or having knowledge of cooking. Thus, an average of 12 students was included in each group and thus 18 samples were included in each of the groups.\n\n2.2. Design {#sec2.2}\n-----------\n\nThe design was a randomized sampling where the sample was divided by the food groups and then the students were randomly assigned to either A or B food groups. Thus, the design for the study was a cross sectional design, as a study involving multiple measurements will normally be a cross sectional design, i.e., the researchers selected a cross sectional sample using randomization. The researchers also ensured that the students were given no more than 5 food groups per day and had them choose 5 food groups from the list of 10 food groups that they were randomly assigned in the first stage of sampling. The researchers selected 4 students each in the food groups in the second stage. The researchers ensured that the students were given no more than 5 food groups per day for that particular food group in the second stage of sampling. The three researchers assigned the students randomly to an A or B food group. The three researchers who did not participate in the study had no participation during the interview sessions of the study. One researcher in each group recorded the outcome and also the sociodemographic characteristics of the selected students in the field diary. The researcher then used the data as the primary source for generating the sample size for the study. The sample size was derived using the following formula.\n\n$$n = \\frac{z_{\\alpha}\\sqrt{2}}{\\delta\\sqrt{pq}}$$ [Figure (1)](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"} is the flow chart for the study and [Table (1)](#tab1){ref-type=\"table\"} shows that the sample size was calculated as 19 in total. This sample size of 19 could provide a confidence level of 95% that 80% of those recruited would not differ from those selected. Taking into account the error of 5%, the number required in each group was 10 in each group. Thus, a total of 15 students were selected for each group. Thus, a total of 45 students were randomly assigned to the groups for the interview and the food preference assessment. Group A was Food and Drink Group and Group B was Snacks and Beverages Group in this study. Thus, 45 students were randomly selected for this study as the sample was proportional to the population of the sample and is close to the sample size calculated (19 in each group). The selection of sample was randomized in the field by selecting 4 students each time from food groups in each group. The 3 researchers conducting the study were not part of it as they did not interact with the students or make changes to the study and were selected because of their expertise in the fields and did not interact with the students during or after the interview sessions. This research was carried out from February 12 to 20, 2013 and the data was collected in the academic year 2013-2014.\n\n2.3.

{"text": "Generally speaking, while all member states recognise that EU law will be the basis of their future common fisheries policy (CFP) in line with the Good Friday Agreement from Ireland, the other four member states have said that they will put forward their own alternative CFP which contains some EU legislation and which it will be necessary to negotiate separately from the EU.\n\nFisherman in Northern Ireland will have to change their legal instruments for taking fish by hand in the meantime. The UK Parliament is scheduled to vote on the fisheries agreement legislation on 14 and 15 February and then it is likely to be agreed by the European Parliament as early as 14 May.\n\nUK MEPs from the group of European People’s Party (EPP) who wanted the UK to continue fishing on the basis of EU law.\n\nAccording to Mark Leonard, Chief Executive of the Marine Conservation Society UK, the proposed CFP would be the same as the existing UK CFP or it will put the UK further down the line, saying “I think that’s very much the case.”\n\nHe said there are concerns the proposed changes could have implications for Scottish fish stocks, which, along with the rest of the UK, has to give a quota to EU nations for fishing on its waters.\n\n“If they want to put pressure on the member states for further conservation measures we will do what we have always done, that will be to continue to look to the other member countries to put pressure but of course we will have to agree a CFP with them.”\n\n“We would then look to other member states for conservation solutions and that will be one of the elements that the CFP must include.”\n\nThe MEP group agreed that there needed to be more detail about how UK fisheries policy should operate in the longer term in the UK and how EU rules might operate differently in the future in the context of the forthcoming negotiations.\n\nThey were particularly critical of the wording of the proposed ‘tolerance zone’ which they would like to see in the CFP – “fishermen from both sides of the English Channel working side by side on one piece of sea to be able to fish together in a very, very small area if they so wish, where they are fishing for the most part the same fish”.\n\nThey also urged the UK to put a higher priority on the conservation role the UK could take in the CFP in place of the ‘catch share’ and quota system which they called an unnecessary “consequential system”.\n\nWhat is included in the proposed framework of fisheries regulation?\n\nThe CFP is a framework agreement with all of the 28 EU states, designed to achieve common interests in regard to fisheries.\n\nIt is designed to ensure EU fleets manage fish stocks effectively with an EU-wide focus on stock protection. It provides for fisheries policies and management arrangements. It will ensure that EU and non-European fleets have access to fish catches under the existing European Union fishing operations as well as new fishery management arrangements within the European Union to cover fishery resources and sectors with special requirements. It sets out the rules on cooperation under a single fisheries policy and defines the key elements and the principle of the framework.\n\nIn October 2015, the European Commission published a document on the framework and the principles of the common fisheries policy (CFP).\n\nThe document was a product of the ongoing efforts of the common fisheries policy (CFP) working group, an intergovernmental body of representatives of the EU Member States and the European Parliament on fisheries, founded in October 2013.\n\nThe proposed framework is the product of a three-year consultation process, starting in September 2014 and ending in November 2016.\n\nThe report of the consultation describes a number of areas and elements, including objectives, principles and a list of potential actions.\n\nThe report contains ideas and proposals to harmonise fisheries practices and tackle marine pollution, which could give the European Union as much control of fisheries as other economic activities.\n\n“The European Commission will consider the proposals made by the working group,” the European Parliament said at the time of publication.\n\n“The Commission notes with satisfaction the progress towards the objectives set out in the three-year time frame and welcomes the progress made in the consultation document with regard to these objectives.\n\n“However, the Council and the Commission note that certain aspects of proposed measures or specific proposals are inconsistent with other EU policies and that others, in particular regarding access to the European economic area, have not been agreed with the Council as yet.”\n\nThe council and the commission have until December 1 to say what they will do in response, at which point the working group report and the consultation document are to be forwarded to the European Council for confirmation.\n\nThe working group is composed of representatives for fishing, marine environment and marine policy from the EU Council, Parliament and the Commission.\n\nThe consultation is", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "The concept of prime number is so important that it is used on the back of paper currency. As a measure of worth, it’s used to distinguish the more valuable from less valuable currency.\n\nPrime numbers are the most important mathematical concept, as they stand for all other numbers, with each being less significant than the previous one.\n\nThe most important prime numbers are those that appear on the number line or in arithmetic (prime factoring).\n\nYou can check for the primeness of numbers by subtracting them from each other:\n\nThe number 5 has the number five prime factors, three prime factors, and no prime factors; 2 is 3 prime factors, 1 prime factor, and no prime factors; 17 is 13 prime factors, 10 prime factors, and 11 prime factors.\n\nThe number 1 has two prime factors (2 and 1), five prime factors (1, 4, 2, 3, and 5), and no prime factors.\n\nAnother interesting way to check primeness is by counting the divisors of a number:\n\nHow Can We Reduce this?\n\nWhat if in the expression, we replace all the primes numbers with a few common factor numbers in a list that contains prime numbers (with a little bit of flexibility on the ordering)? This is more elegant and less error-sensitive than finding a way to calculate the required primes numbers from the large collection above, but also comes at a cost as this requires lots of memory or other processing power to run, so it’s used less now than in the past.\n\nWhat if you want all the primes numbers with a very large prime factor (say all prime numbers from 1 to 1000000) to be removed?\n\nInstead, how about if all the primes numbers with a very small prime factor (say all prime numbers from 1 to 10) are removed?\n\nThis is a nice one, especially if there might be a large prime factor in the list, but not as large as those above.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t always work. The reason is that a number is not considered prime when its proper divisors are all 1. For example, 19 is prime because 1, 3, and 5 are its proper divisors, but its prime factor is 9 because it’s divisor is 1 is even and its divisor is 3 is odd.\n\nYou may need to do this to find all the prime numbers with an odd number of divisors, and all the prime numbers with an even number of divisors, etc. (This is called “primes factorization”).\n\nThis is where the technique of prime number factoring comes in. The algorithm is very efficient and is much faster than the brute-force approach above or other fast algorithm’s that factor primes.\n\nI won’t go into details about the algorithm, or how to calculate the required numbers, because they are well-covered elsewhere.\n\nI just want to tell you why it’s important for me to show you this! After learning the method of prime number factoring, I started doing calculations to find all prime numbers under a certain value for x (x was an arbitrary constant) such that no larger prime would be divisible by that large number.\n\nI usually use the prime number x=2147483647. You may use any arbitrary prime number.\n\nAfter doing these calculations, I was astonished by how many primes were divisible by x – not the small primes (the usual primes) but rather by many, many prime factors with relatively small factor numbers (of x).

{"text": "Well, Alyssa Edwards, you made a lovely fourth alternate. Although I agree with you regarding the way L.A. looks, I found another poster's interpretation way overbearing in terms of characterization. You are better served, I think, looking at the three characters you have chosen, not necessarily in terms of how they look or how they act, but instead with a keen and thoughtful knowledge of which traits the characters actually have and the reasons behind those traits. In the character studies you've done for the original, you've shown this ability to look at characters in a more balanced, analytical way, as well as to take a good look at yourself. I really appreciate this approach on your part of this series, as it is very unique, and a model of such writing requires some great personal conviction.\nThe problem we often encounter, and perhaps it's time to address it, is the tendency to write for a mass market by focusing on what we call, as I did above, the ‘high fashion’ aesthetics. What I’ve noticed in such popular books as the ‘Twilight saga’ or even Stephenie Meyer’s series, as well as many non-fiction books based on vampire tales for adults, is that many of the characters are written either as mere props or characters, or as props dressed up in clothes. I believe this is in the nature of the story, for example, a vampire can’t really be that nice, unless one imagines a vampire as a very nice person in the beginning. And this also extends to some of the characters such as Elle and Jasper, where they are dressed up (literally) with a number of outfits, from the simple to elaborate, and the writing is just designed to make them look like the kind of characters we tend to imagine. But I was wondering if you see the need to bring some variety into things like, for example, vampires, where do the characters look if they truly cannot be that way (I.e. wearing the clothes, having the ‘look’)? Or again a character such as Jasper – how can one write his character, if he cannot be seen?\n\nSo, on the one hand we have the ‘Twilight’ and the ‘Mummy’ novels, where the characters are designed to look exactly how we see them, they are almost completely artificial creations (the most famous example being Maud ‘Trixie’ Faireborn, who becomes a vampire, and we know has to be a vampire because it is impossible for someone other than a vampire to turn into stone), and there is an important distinction in the difference between appearance and real life and the difference between ‘artifice’ and ‘reality’. I think this makes sense, but what doesn’t is why such a character would or could have been the way he is. You’ve written about the ‘Twilight’ series in relation to your character of L.A., when she first appears, you write, “As L.A. is about to do her first vampire transformation, she looks over at Jasper for moral support, and finds him by the coffin. She knows where he is, and she knows about the vampire. Her reaction surprises Jasper. He had expected to see her at first blush, for her transformation has left her dressed only in a nightgown with a robe over it. But what he’s not expecting, is she to turn him into one of the undead” [4], which is the beginning of the character’s transformation. Now what if this were never told, what if one can’t know what happens later, and Jasper doesn’t know that, at the beginning she never knew the vampires were out-of-control and out of control for a long time, and she never realised how beautiful the vampires could be? What if she had, like, lived in New York City, or in L.A. or something, instead of being in a hotel room in New York?\nNow this isn’t to say that the series has to go on forever, I don’t think it does, but it’s almost as if one needs more than just the character of L.A. and Jasper to write the series, if everyone needs to be presented as they would appear were they in their natural habitat, then maybe the series could be written with a more complex and varied character. And I hope L.A. can become ‘Twilight’ with a different kind of protagonist – not a vampire, not a vampire hunter, a much different kind of protagonist. I wanted to say here, that by using Jasper as the protagonist the novels actually work quite well, and maybe the reason why the novels work well is because Jasper is such a complex character…\n\nBut then I read your review and you write, “My only concern was that Jasper is", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "This projection was not included in the final summary for the National Highway System's 2009-2010 Transportation Research Board study. The NHTSA determined that the study of the National Highway System was premature since the costs to achieve the long range National Transportation Highway System goals were not known. The Board decided to develop its own plans, taking the top-level system that was developed when the study was developed, but removing some of the projects that have been identified as part of the long-range plans. The Board's long-range approach does leave more potential projects in the NHTSA's proposal, but the overall goals were not as ambitious as the long-lived long-range National System Strategic Highway Research program.\n\nThe National Highway System (NHS) is a key component of the federal Interstate Highway System (IHS); and an integral component of the planned national transportation system of the 21st century. It constitutes a backbone of new, heavy-duty highways, and provides a range of improved secondary roads, bicycle and pedestrian paths, and safety and mobility enhancements on existing highways. Because transportation is central to our physical and economic well-being, it is an important national priority, worthy of significant research and development efforts. The NHTSA and its transportation-research partners developed a three-level framework for conducting and evaluating research and policy development (see Figure 2).\n\nThe first level of the NHS framework is an organizational chart representing the five government agencies that are authorized to sponsor and finance or conduct research projects: (1) the Department of Transportation, (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), (3) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), (4) the Federal Highway Administration, and (5) the General Accountability Panel (GAP).\n\nThe second level of the framework is the system level, which includes each national highway system (NHS), along with the nation's four regional highway systems. The regional highway systems are the Eastern, Texas, Southern, and Pacific (EAST, TEXAS, and SP) systems.\n\nThe third level of the NHS framework is the individual highway level, which includes each highway project. A highway project is defined as a set of actions, taken on a national- or state-wide or regional basis, designed to improve transportation through the application of new technology or existing technology. In total, the system level, the highway level, and the projects level represent all seven national, interstate highways. The NHS also includes multiple projects, or segments, of a highway project to provide for safety.\n\nThe four federal funding programs that support national highway research are the National Highway System Program, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Federal Highway Funding Program, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation (TIFI) Programs, and the Highway Research and Development Program (HARD). The national Highway System Program is a program administered by the FHWA that provides a dedicated base of funds to support the research, development and deployment of highway infrastructure. In addition, each highway is eligible for other government subsidies, such as money for surface improvements and non-motorized roadways.\n\nEach highway is eligible for at least one program funding opportunity, and there are about 1,000 highway projects under consideration. The funding programs are discussed in more detail in the summary tables.\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)\n\nFHWA oversees the national highway research programs and funds. Specifically, the FHWA is responsible for determining the needs of highway projects and deciding on the eligibility of each highway project to apply for funding under one of the five highway research projects. The FHWA is also responsible for evaluating and selecting projects for funding, providing funding allocations, establishing performance and cost benchmarks and performance levels for highway projects, and overseeing the application of the funds that are awarded under the five programs (see Tables 4 and 5).\n\nTable 4. NHS Project Funding Awards from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)\n\nNHS funding priorities\n\nThe FHWA, in consultation with its highway research partners, has developed a series of five research priorities (see Table 2).

The spin dependent term has the eigenvalues $E_i\\simeq U$, and the eigenenergies are nearly equal for the spin-independent and - dependent terms. This allows us to approximate the spin-dependence effect as if the spin-dependent term is absent and take $\\alpha_i =0$. In the absence of spin-dependent term, the effective Hamiltonian becomes $\\hat H_{int}^0=\\sum_{ij}Dm_{ij}\\hat n_i^{(I)}\\hat p_j^{(I)}$ with renormalized hopping integrals and the intra - and - inter - orbital hopping amplitudes are $D=1/N$ and $D=U/N$, respectively. Here $N$ is the normal occupation number for a spin-independent spin - independent term, $N\\equiv\\sum_{i}\\left(1-n_{i\\sigma}\\right)$, while $n_{i\\sigma}=\\left(n_{i{\\uparrow}}+n_{i{\\downarrow}}\\right)/2$ is the occupation of a spin-down - electron at each site. Thus, the intra - and - inter - orbital - hoppings contribute only to the kinetic energy term of the spin-independent term while the spin- dependent term is described by intra - orbital and - orbital hopping integrals for spin-down - electrons and inter - orbital hopping terms for electrons with spin. In terms of the intra - and - inter - orbital hopping amplitudes, the spin - dependent terms and the kinetic energy of the spin-dependent term can be written as $[{\\hat H_v}+{\\hat H_\\chi}]^2\\int_{v}\\frac{N}{2{E_t}}\\left\\{\\left[\\left(\\Delta_T^1\\right)^2+\\left(\\Delta_T^2\\right)^2\\right]\\cos^2{k}v+4D^2m^2\\sin^2{k}v_v \\cos^2{k}u_v\\right\\}\\frac{dv}{v}$, and $[{\\hat H_v}+{\\hat H_\\chi}]u_T^2k^4$ (spin dependent intra - and - inter - orbital interaction, and intra - orbital and - orbital hopping energy, respectively), respectively, with renormalized intra - and - orbital - hoppings $k=\\pi\\left(\\Delta_T^1+\\Delta_T^2\\right)/d$ ($u_T(v)$ is the band velocity of the spin- dependent terms, and it depends on the intra - and - inter - orbital hopping integrals; $\\Delta_T^1$ and $\\Delta_T^2$ are related to the intra - and - inter - orbital hopping integral; and the effective hopping integral can be rewritten as $\\tilde D=D-\\alpha_T^2$, where $\\tilde D$ is the renormalized band energy of the spin-dependent term which includes the interaction only with all spin-up electrons, and $\\alpha_T$ is the interaction parameter, i.e., the spin-dependent hopping integral between different bands for spin-up electrons.

{"text": "I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it was the first really \"grown\" up horror movie I have seen - it had very adult themes and the plot was interesting. It scared me a lot but I loved it. That's what the whole thing was about, the characters and their lives.\n\nSo basically, what you guys were basically saying is that there wasn't much in the way of \"horror\" in there (like in Silent Hill 3, or for that matter even in Resident Evil 2 : not much in the vein of this).\n\nDid you even watch the movie with a pair of sunglasses on? It wasn't exactly a haunted house with ghosts.\n\nIt wasn't the same thing but yeah, I remember sitting in the theatre and listening to it with my headphones on and it was the first horror film I've ever seen where the characters were actually creepy.\n\nI think they were trying to have it make a little bit of a statement, because it was based on a horror novel and a horror short story series by Stephen King (his daughter mentioned it, so that's something).\n\nA lot of time was wasted trying to be something other than \"just a movie again\" - one reviewer said it had the best \"dub work\" of the entire series (they did this often), that there wasn't any scary scenes, that the ghosts weren't really scary, etc.\n\nThe thing that probably killed it is that they tried to be scary by using a lot of visual effects (and it looked bad, and tried to be scary, and tried to be scary, and tried to be scary with the acting, and then made it all seem like they had a lot of fun with it, and then tried to hide it with an ominous score and then tried to hide it with the \"haunted house\", and then tried to hide it with the'spooky' stuff, etc. The only reason \"Night Shift\" became so popular was that it was actually scary) - everything was trying to be a little bit scary in terms of special effects in order to put people on their feet.\n\nAt least they came up with the zombie in their own time, then it was like \"Okay cool! Zombies! You think it'll scare the hell out of people who want a lot of \"gore\"? We do have the ability to \"make people afraid.\" But then, the film went to the cheap route and used the \"weird creature\" as it's main theme.\n\nSo, in the end, I guess it was good - it had the actors and the cast on their feet the whole way through, but they never had much interaction with the audience, and the actors were the ones who seemed to get a lot of \"scare\" out of it.\n\nWhen I see this film (or it was when I saw it in theatres, I forget) I got more scares from the previews of it than I did the actual movie itself. What are you guys talking about? It's a film that had a lot of \"cool\" and \"interesting\" things added to it to get the right \"feeling\" for the main story. Maybe too much, but in the end it's a good film. The ending left you thinking it was a good movie. I think you would have better luck trying to find the good in a bad movie!\n\nI don't know what to say about this film. I've never really understood horror films - it's just too \"over the top\". What can I say, I see it as an art film made by an art film fan trying to make some kind of creative statement. When I saw the previews of this I thought the film had no depth and was a big mess - but once it came out I was surprised how much depth there is. Sure, the characters aren't realistic but I think it's the characters that make the film. For example I think it's really well done because I see the performances and the acting and I see the writers doing something interesting - maybe some of you guys could elaborate on that. My other favourite character in it is the creepy girl on TV whom I think will turn up in one of the follow-ups. She was so well done and made to feel like an oddball yet believable.\n\nI don't know how many horror films I've seen and still prefer the Stephen King original. I'm not sure anything has changed, horror films have become over the top and there are so many movies out there now. Just looking at the comments on this review gives me goosebumps! It's funny, I thought this would be the perfect horror film where you could just sit down with a group of friends, watch as the camera rolled and everyone was acting like a crazy person. But then I see reviews of Stephen King adaptations like these, and I wonder how come they are so good and where could it go wrong (the end). It's quite frustrating. But I", "label": "gptneo"}

They include lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, and infection with human herpesvirus-8. More precise information was gained with the identification of virus-binding sites. Virus infection triggers immune reactions that increase the permeability of blood vessels. This allows the virus to enter the blood and infect the organs \\[[@CR1]\\]. Since the virus can cause a severe and often fatal disease, it is necessary to consider infection with this virus in patients with various disease profiles.\n\nThe present report describes the clinical characteristics of six patients who presented with an altered mental status (AMS) and fever that was preceded by a viral infection. A causal relationship was not established with the viral disease reported herein, but the patient's condition was improved with a reduction in the intensity of medication.\n\nIn the present report, two men and four women between 70 years of age and 60 years of age, respectively, were seen. Three of the people involved were non-smokers and two of them were ex-smokers. One person had no underlying disease at the time of diagnosis, and the other had diabetes complicated by nephrosis. Two out of the six cases were positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and were taking combination anti-retroviral medications. The other two individuals did not have an identifiable risk factor for their infection.\n\nA recent history of fever or body aches preceded the onset of an altered mental status (AMS) in two of the six patients in the present report. All of them had a history of an upper respiratory tract infection or a common cold. The first two patients, who were 60 years of age and 80 years of age, respectively, presented with a fever of 40.8 °C and a body aches that began on the 2nd day after the symptoms. The body aches were relieved without the use of any medication. The other four patients described a similar history of a fever of 37.2--38.6 °C that began in the early morning, and all of them visited a physician after the onset of the disease, and all four patients were given antibiotics, and one received an increase in the medication dose. A laboratory examination conducted on the last day of fever revealed the following: the white blood cell count was 13 × 103/μl (normal range = 4--10), and the platelet count was 30 × 10^4^/μl (normal range = 130--350). Two patients also used steroids in addition to antibiotics. The patients' mental status was also examined. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 11 for the first two patients before any treatments, while it was 17 for the remaining patients. The results of neurological examination were normal in the first patient. In addition, there was no impairment in the second patient.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), febrile viral infections can cause mental and behavioral disorders, such as confusion, disorientation, and amnesia. It can also cause the development of delirious state due to a viral infection with the potential to cause mental disorders \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\].\n\nSome studies reported that patients with a febrile viral infection may have behavioral disturbances, such as psychosis and delirium \\[[@CR4], [@CR5]\\]. The authors of one of those studies believe that a combination of immune and nutritional factors that are produced during early infection may result in emotional turmoil \\[[@CR6]\\].\n\nIn the case of the first patient in whom fever and mental status signs occurred, the patient visited the emergency room after the onset of the symptoms and complained that the body aches left a bad taste in his mouth. Two weeks before the onset of the symptoms, the patient experienced fatigue that began in the early morning.

Thus,\nnot all the particles that are in a meteorite are of asteroid origin.\n\nThe properties of meteorites were once primarily interpreted in terms of\ncomposition and growth of minerals derived from the surface of asteroids and\nfrom the cometary nucleus. Over the past 30 years it has been recognized that\nboth elements and compounds that are common in meteorites are also found in\nmany other meteorite types (Lunine et al., 2001a,b; Pravec, 2002).\nThe meteorite that is known as Chiron is the most pristine carbonaceous\ntype mineral that we know of, containing 99.5% carbon with varying amounts of\nsilicate minerals (Pravec, 2002). The meteorite with the name Pallas,\nwhich is a silicate of iron and sulfur, as well as rare-earth-element\ncontaining rocks, is the most primitive meteoritic material in terms of\nchemical and mineralogical characteristics (Lunine et al., 2001a). The\ncompounds in both meteorites are essentially carbon, hydrogen, and silicon\ncompounds in chemical equilibrium, with the other elements being all\ntraceable to rock-forming elements in the Earth's crust.\n\nSome authors in recent years have claimed that some materials in meteorites\nare, in fact, the products of meteorite-impact or asteroid-based processes.\nFor example, there are no trace amounts of water (Owen, 1999), oxygen (M.\nC. Wetherup, 2000), and even radioactive elements (K. K. Kuiper, 2002;\nPravec, 2001). Although these claims remain unproven, some recent studies\n(Zellner 1991; Kuiper and Wetherup, 2000; M. C. Wetherup, 2000, 2003a,b;\nPravica and Wetherup, 2003) have shown that meteorites that contain materials\nthat are similar to the products of impact processes contain material with a\nbacteriological and chemical composition that cannot be explained by the\nconveyors-belt model used when describing the delivery of the materials from\ntheir parent bodies (Pravica & Wetherup, 2003). The materials in meteorites\nthat are difficult to explain by a conveyor-belt model are very reactive and\nsometimes highly toxic, such as those in meteorite Zakhara (Burr,\n1971; Kuiper, 2002). There is even evidence of compounds that are formed in\nthe interior of a meteorite that are not found on the comet, suggesting a\nprocess that occurs during delivery of the meteorite to a planet or to\nanother star (Pravica, 2003; Pravec, 2003).\n\nIt is obvious that the properties and composition of meteorites are very\nvaried and can be affected by the chemical composition of the grains that\noriginate the meteorite itself (Pravec, 2001). It is possible that materials\nthat are unusual for a specific meteorite type cannot have originated from\ncomposition effects of the grains that formed in the parent body, but might\nhave been produced during delivery of the meteorite into the nebula. It would\nbe interesting to find meteorites with unique and previously unobserved\nproperties.\n\nAt one time it was thought that elements would always have been present\ninside and on the surfaces of meteorites. Some authors, however, have said\nthat there are trace amount of elements that do not naturally occur\n(M. C. Wetherup, 2001). The presence of such materials raises some problems.\nFirstly, how does a meteorite enter the planetary system without the\naddition of such potentially dangerous elements such as uranium and\nplutonium? It would appear that only the very rare and powerful solar\nactivity could have produced the", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "While in a plane, flicking through the large choice of snacks, you notice the flight attendant’s serving tray. Usually, but not always, your flight starts with cheese slices and nuts.\n\nFlurry and energy (and whatnot) may be expected. It helps them get through the next hours of a routine. As such, those cheese/nut trays become important items to keep handy for when the work day and the rest of the day takes a breather. We all know those who keep a spare change of them in their pockets or purse somewhere. Well, the time you put toward the food tray might be the most productive time you could spend when in flight.\n\nThis applies as much to your travel as eating, as your food plan will depend on which type of food you consume on a regular basis (and what time of the day you find it most helpful). It is worth considering the type of foods you prefer to eat. And since you will often be sitting down, take care of your table (or at least the tray) accordingly. It is a good idea to order several snack foods to make enough food for those who consume it daily or even on an occasional basis. So for this you can either order your foods in advance or by picking them out at a certain time at a counter where it doesn’t require a meal fee from the passenger to enjoy that particular food (such as a snack bar or the food/snack tray).\n\nIn some cases, however, the food tray is a simple option to fill up the table with. It includes some bread (for more fiber), fruit, nuts, yogurt, cookies, or even candy (for something sweet) and maybe a drink. But it would pay to make sure to order some nutritious or more health and balanced snacks for those who will eat what they are served.\n\nIt will certainly bring down the number of empty spots in the flight in a timely manner if everyone is served food in their tray’s (or in the food/snack trays’s) place. It also enables the flight attendant to rest or take a few breaks instead of working the complete period. And in my experience, the flight attendants appreciate a flight when most passengers are happy and it also means less fatigue being experienced by them during a flight.\n\nHaving breakfast at the flight will be even better if it is of the healthy variety. They will find it harder to resist when you are offering them healthy options. Thus, make sure to offer some with which they will appreciate, which the flight attendant’s tray will never do.\n\nDo Your Homework before Flying\n\nIt is no surprise to many who fly that their flight schedule always becomes very stressful. People are often forced into uncomfortable situations, as flights are rarely scheduled well. Often times, flying is a very stressful routine.\n\nThis includes delays, cancels and long delays that make people want to check-their-destination-flight-status. There is often much frustration flying.\n\nMany airlines will try to cut your flying cost by offering lower prices to the consumers. This often comes at your expense when you need to delay your flight because of delays you never realized there were in flights coming in the next hour.\n\nBut not only do airlines need to cut costs but also they want to make your trip as convenient as possible. That means providing the best services possible. As such, they need to improve their food service offering and their baggage handling for the convenience of the customers.\n\nIt is no wonder that a lot of people are trying to improve their flying times by finding out the best ways to fly. Often it involves scheduling an overbooking or overbooking. Having a few hours to catch a later but more convenient flight is a great perk. And it always provides more time, as the passenger has had more time to prepare for the overbooking.\n\nHaving the flight overbooked brings a lot of inconvenience to the passenger, as well as the flight attendants. But it also brings an extra benefit. This is why travelers want to know when to book the right flight overbooking. An overbooking is not supposed to happen, but it still happens every year or so. The best way for passengers are to know which airline is always willing to overbook and in the very beginning of the flight and wait for the last flight before the other passengers.\n\nHaving this knowledge before the flight, makes it easy for the passenger to have a much better travel experience. The customer can easily book an overbooking well in advance of the flight.\n\nIt is no secret to people who fly that airline prices can vary depending on many factors. Usually, the lowest prices for travel fare do not exist in the lowest price range. That is the reason why it is possible to buy a flight that is half the price of an airline ticket but has much more of an inconvenience.\n\nIt has been a few years since the last time the airline industry experienced", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "we investigate a condensed matter `` black hole '' analog. Our motivation is to understand the structure of a black hole by analogy with atomic physics, the two fields being not only unrelated but also fundamentally opposed. A comparison is made with a quantum black hole using the language of condensed matter physics. We find that the two theories are indeed very similar. One can relate some exact properties of the quantum black hole such as entropy and black hole entropy gap with the condensed matter theory. It is however difficult to derive general results, and more work has to be done to clarify the basic issue of the similarity of the two theories. One of our final results is to find a correspondence between the effective black holes of the two theories, namely black holes of the condensed matter theory. Black holes in condensed matter physics are called ``partons`` in the terminology of high energy physics. On the other hand, one often finds the effective black holes of condensed matter theory in condensed matter physics. One is tempted to speculate on the relation between the two terms. We leave a further investigation on this topic to future work.\n\nWe review how to use a quantum computer to find a better approximation to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Schrödinger equation (SE) than is typically possible using classical computers. This is a special case of a more general idea: by using a quantum computer to approximate the SE, one could get an improved answer by quantum-mechanically measuring some properties of the quantum computer (for instance, by using a quantum circuit). We define a ``measurement circuit``, which serves as the basic building block of an approximation, and show that there is a quantum circuit (based on Clifford operations) realizing the transformation (which is non-unitary) that maps an initial state of the SE to an equivalent state in which the approximate eigenfunction has more peaks or is better localized. Our quantum circuits are polynomial size and are well suited to be used as building blocks for quantum algorithms to approximate SE. Examples of quantum algorithms that can be done with these circuits include quantum Fourier transform, quantum search, and matrix inversion. We also discuss how such circuits are used in practice.\n\nWe extend the work of Brannan and others, who showed that certain Hamiltonians with random anisotropic interactions can be represented using effective 1-particle Hamiltonians that are very different from the usual 1-particle Hamiltonian of the isolated system. For instance, at low temperatures, effective Hamiltonian approaches to a 2-dimensional harmonic quantum rotor in free space have higher energy than that of the full quantum Hamiltonian due to the additional interaction, while at high temperatures the opposite is true.\n\nWe construct new families of exact solutions of the nonlinear equation that governs the dynamical evolution of black hole spacetimes with time dependent coupling constants, which are different from the previously known solutions. These solutions are classified using two non-linear parameters, namely a combination of the gravitational scalar and the non-linear component of the metric. When these two parameters are fixed and the corresponding free Hamiltonians can be expressed solely in terms of the dynamical variables, we are able to find exact solutions.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce two new exact solutions of one-dimensional integrable models with inverse power law potentials. The existence of these two solution is studied in detail, including solutions with negative energy and solutions that do not exist for a single value of the coupling constant.\n\nWhen one wants to predict the dynamical behavior of complex nonlinear systems and analyze their stability from the dynamical viewpoint, the simplest method is to expand the general solution of the system in series or in integral form. One then can use the coefficients of the respective expansions to study the dynamical behavior. The aim of this article is to present the general method of solution in which one can obtain the series and integral solutions by some appropriate transformations. The method can be used to derive the solution of the general system, and also to study its evolution with time for a given initial condition. In this approach, one can use general formulas of general series and in particular those from the theory of the infinite series of series. It is also possible to use general methods of integration. To illustrate this method, we give in this paper four representative examples from various fields. We investigate the influence of numerical integration over initial conditions on these four classes of solutions, and show that their comparison gives an effective criterion for the choice of numerical integration in numerical solution procedures. Further, we show examples of the use of these techniques for the study of complex dynamical systems.\n\nA new type of black hole was discovered. Its mass, surface gravity and entropy can be determined by observation but the details of its internal structure remain a mystery. We introduce methods to calculate the internal structure of this object, based on methods in classical black hole thermodynamics.\n\nIn our earlier work we have shown that the classical black hole solution with a scalar field presents a new kind of dynamical", "label": "gptneo"}

I hope you can find it as rewarding as I am to write about, knowing that we left this musical journey far too early. I am so grateful we made it so far. I will never forget this musical journey and I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. Please know there is so much more to come for this amazing musical!\n\nA Musical Journey of a Survivor\n\nI am happy to share this final chapter, but it will not be a sad one for me. This journey with my family was my favorite one to walk on. I have never lived in poverty and was raised in an upper middle class family. We had everything we ever wanted and it all happened because of how my family and people around our place supported me. I feel privileged to have experienced such an incredible life with my parents and siblings. I have no regrets because we had the most amazing life. No one will ever question that what we had is the most blessed thing. This was not all because of people working in the community, but many people helping my family to survive. This is a big achievement that I will never forget. It was through my family that I realized if we give up anything, we deserve it, and we have been given far, far, much more than we could ever imagine.\n\nMy siblings and I came in search of opportunities while raising our parents. They were surviving in an unproductive poverty situation. It was a nightmare for us to raise them both in such an environment. However, through the grace of God, it all worked. Our parents gave us the most amazing gift of an education to enable us to build an even better future for our family. This was a family in search of a better future and together, we gave them back more than they had. We taught our parents an incredible lesson, which is that they are not the only ones blessed with a good life, we are blessed in turn. I feel so privileged to have been raised in a better and better environment. I feel blessed that we will have the same opportunities that other people come across.\n\nI am not the only one who feels proud for having raised my siblings who is going in the wrong direction. My friends are growing up in the right environment. I am honored to even be a part of such a powerful story and am honored to be a part of an amazing musical that made an impact on the world. Every time I think of how we came to be apart, it makes me realize that the Lord has truly blessed us. Through such a hard experience and through such a difficult journey we have experienced, I now feel that the Lord has made it possible for us to experience these amazing moments in life.\n\nIt is my honor to be able to share my story with you. These were the most wonderful moments of my life, which I will never forget. I wish my family could be there, but I know they are better off staying in the real world. I will never let them down as I remember I stood up for them with all my might. We are blessed and we will continue to be blessed in the years to come.\n\nHow we are now going to leave you, I do not know. There is not much more we can say about this part of our lives. We can share our journey with you, but we cannot say much. I hope you have enjoyed our journey with these lyrics in your soul. I was always in the mindset that at the end of this journey people will remember the music of our journey.\n\nWe came out of this world better persons. We left this musical journey better than when we entered it. However, we have so much more, we have left a legacy behind us. One such legacy is that we will always have a wonderful story that we believe in, regardless of the circumstances in which we have experienced and the pain we have been through. We just continue to believe in God’s goodness, and we continue to be thankful for the blessing and opportunity in our lives. Even in the darkest moments during our musical journey, I believe in our Lord. I have been taught to never walk away from a tough challenge, I think that’s why I am still here. I am hoping I can inspire others during this last day, to believe in their Creator and keep going no matter what hardships life throws at us. Thank you for your support and we will keep you updated on the rest of our journey.\n\nFrom the end of time, the universe was not created to stand still but have constant change.

{"text": "31 December 2015 Last updated at 16:30 GMT BBC News The UK government has backed away from its pledge to extend some benefits for illegal workers, it emerged today, after a series of rows over migrants' immigration status. \"There is no point in paying benefits to illegal migrants,\" said the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), which runs local benefits systems in England and Wales. In a move unlikely to encourage illegal immigrants to be better integrated into the UK, the department also announced that it would no longer carry out checks at ports of entry to see if people have correct employment or immigration status documents. The move appeared to indicate that the UK, like the US, was determined to get out of immigration rules that are causing deep resentment amongst many illegal immigrants. The government's long-standing position on illegal immigrants is being undermined by two factors: The number of foreign nationals who get into trouble at the UK's borders is estimated to be between 11 and 14 million. The government estimates that this is equivalent to between 3 and 5 million illegal immigrants. \"If people were able [to] show it, I suppose people are going to work here, then they'd have the capacity to show their immigration status,\" said Lord Malloch-Brown, who is chairman of the Migration Council. \"And the government are now backing away from the position they should be backing away from.\" Lord Malloch-Brown told the Press Association he was sure many of those working legally in Britain would appreciate the government abandoning its policy stance in the face of widespread public anger over immigration. Lord Malloch-Brown, the new chairman of the Migration Council, said that it was important migrants had secure and legal protection in the UK. \"I don't think they understand that they will be discriminated against if they are treated as if they were illegal or they will suffer in the workplace if everyone is treated like as if they are not citizens,\" he told the Press Association.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

{"text": "Did Clear Weather Play a Role in JFK's Assassination?By Samantha-Rae Shafer\n\nAlthough many historians and conspiracy theorists believe assassination was a staged show to get rid of JFK, he was assassinated under clear weather conditions.\n\nSome claim weather was the key factor in his murder.\n\nWeather was not the only conspiracy theory that has surfaced regarding the JFK assassination. Many believe the CIA staged the crime, with Weather being the key.\n\nIn an article featured on the JFK Library page titled ‘Was the 9/11 Conspiracy a Weather Extraterrestrial Event?’, author William Martin reveals that, according to weather experts, John Kennedy may have become a target because of his position within the government. Martin quotes the author as saying, \"The U.S. presidents are the least predictable people in the world. With the possible exception of weather, you just don’t know what they’re going to do.\"\n\nAnother report states that JFK was assassinated because his wife had been \"out of the loop\" on various decisions with JFK and his advisors, and that JFK’s actions were inconsistent with his character and position in the government - in addition to being the president of the United States.\n\nJohn Kennedy was involved in some controversial decisions, such as his decision not to get involved with the Cuban Missile Crisis. This decision is one of many conspiracy theories that accuse President Kennedy as being either a \"liar, a traitor, or a weak leader\" that does not care about his country.\n\nJFK became a target because of his wife, Jackie Kennedy, who was a divorcee, after his first marriage had crumbled - but he continued with his second marriage. With all of this happening, Kennedy was the most important member of the government - a position, which led other presidents before him in line. In addition to all of the above, JFK was in a position of power, where he could change certain policies that he may have thought were good, before he was removed from office\n\nAfter JFK was assassinated, it was not determined that it was a conspiracy, but rather a “conspiracy within a conspiracy,” that, according to some, the CIA was behind the assassination. Even with all things from the assassination of JFK, whether or not John Kennedy’s assassination was a government conspiracy remains in dispute.\n\nIt could be that there were several different conspiracy theories regarding JFK’s assassination. In an article titled “JFK ‘Conspiracy’: The Truth,” author Steve Coll reports that many “conspiracy theories have surfaced during the last decades which question, or even question whether the Kennedy Assassinations was a plot engineered by the CIA.” Coll reports that there is a theory, in which people are talking about “The Day Kennedy was Killed and No Other Power Was Able to Conceal It.”\n\nPeople believe that Kennedy would be a victim of a terrorist attack or, as author David Horowitz writes, that JFK could have been assassinated by CIA agents on March 30, 1964. Horowitz wrote, \"It's a fair bet that he was killed by a mob hit ordered by the CIA and the LBJ-Nixon team.\"\n\nOther conspiracy theories, whether they claim that JFK was shot without a second shot, or that there were two bullets striking JFK at the same time, or that there were two bullets found at the scene of the crime, or some other theory. Some people also claim that JFK would be a victim of a “spy”, such as William Colby.\n\nSome people speculate that the CIA did it, including the assassination of JFK, because they were angry with a Republican president, Richard Nixon. At this point, Nixon is blamed when it was discovered that in 1968, the CIA had planted spies in the government. Many believe that the murder of JFK was ordered by President Nixon, who was running for re-election. Some believe that Kennedy may have been murdered because he was not only pro-witness, but also, he may have been involved in the murder of two other people. These include J.F.K.’s father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and his brother, Robert Kennedy.\n\nThe theories that state Kennedy’s death was a CIA-orchestrated crime, is called the “covert assassination theory”. The author of an article on the JFK Library wrote, \"I suppose it could be said that without this conspiracy, JFK might have been alive today.\" This theory is supported in the popular media by those who believe, they can prove that Kennedy was assassinated by a group of anti-government and anti-Republican, white power, radical extremists.\n\nThe “covert assassination theory” does have a few major problems, however, some people believe these problems do not even exist. According to Steve Coll who wrote a “The John Kennedy Conspiracy: The Truth”, the major problems that", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "this review summarizes our present knowledge about elderly people's risk and resilience to loneliness in relation to: (a) personal dispositions, (b) social ties and social networks, (c) social integration and social capital, and (d) health. It contributes to the social research on aging that combines a conceptual framework based on Bourdieu's concepts of capital and social capital with a set of indicators relevant to vulnerable groups. As suggested by Bourdieu's structural economic thinking, we have shown that the concept of social capital can be linked to Bourdieu's concept of capital. Furthermore, our study gives evidence that social capital is protective and risk-reducing when facing aging challenges, which makes it a novel protective resource that helps aging people remain connected to existing social networks. Therefore, we have proposed \"being connected to social capital\" - a concept that complements the \"being connected to families and persons\" as traditionally employed. Finally, we conclude by pointing out that aging processes are accompanied by changes in health and social variables that impact on aging in the broader sense of the term.", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "Okay, I've watched this movie twice now, I have researched this one on Wikipedia and am in need of some help to resolve some issues that come up in my mind, so I shall ask again, can any one kindly point out where is the most logical flow and logical sequence that can be traced to describe this film, or, at least guide this post with any reference link or something to that effect, or at least answer in detail?\n\n1.Why there will be three \"heroes\":\n\n2.Why people will not like that this hero comes from different country and one of them is not really so 'good'? (Like I'm not really fond of this hero, I have to say he/she is a bit \"anti-social\" and uncivilised, however that is another story.)\n\n3.Why the hero is quite close to these 'heroes'? Is it natural for a hero to always go against the norm? Like, I can easily imagine any good and peaceful guy trying to find peace in his life if he were one with such people? But this thing is a fantasy, or a simulation? And why not the real, real \"good\" world if this hero was there?\n\n4.Why he likes doing evil because as an angel, he was always trying to stop evil? Well why that too only to give it strength, and he even thinks himself to be the only one who can save all the worlds? But now, if he just let the evil do and said nothing more then how the world would be saved from the evil and chaos all over it? He would not be an evil angel now, and he even wants to be such but for some reason, he still wants to remain a bad one, is this logic? Because, he did not have any problem with good, he even was such, but now since he has to face reality in an objective way, he wants his role to be more \"good\" in his eyes?\n\n5.why is his role as angel more fun, he does not have any problem as a villain, just this role of hero is fun for him, and he would also like to be so himself.\n\n6.Why he goes for world conquest in the beginning? Well, I just cannot explain properly there is no flow to this part, could you provide me any link to the explanation? Could we go a bit back? What made him decide to come here? What made him come all this way? What made him look for the world here to conquer? Well, and that too with his powers?\n\n7.Why he does not have any real world friends as he has all these people that are not really his friends, well why is it like that in any way?\n\n8.Why he is happy to become a hero but sad when the day comes that he will have to defend the universe? Why is he this way?\n\n1.) You could say they have come from different countries, but I'm assuming you are only assuming that because of all the historical information that's online.\n\n2.) A bit hard to explain in my opinion, it probably falls back to the 'villain' side of the hero.\n\n3.) You could say that they're friends, but in that case you can be even more vague then.\n\n4.) I honestly have no reference for this one.\n\n5.) I suppose there are any number of possibilities on these, that's the whole point of asking me. I don't know that there is any logic to his actions to do with this, just that they just fall back to the basic definition of the hero.\n\n6.) There is no reason it couldn't have been that way logically, it's just that's what the universe would tell him. There are so many times in the novel when the hero is told when he will have to choose a side, or when he makes his decision, but the hero is so caught up in that process it just falls away.\n\n7. There's no flow to here, just one of his characters stating what happened to the other, which is like the reason why you don't want your main character to be all the same.\n\n8. There is a lot of logic that I don't have and that would make this so much more interesting.\n\nThe most logical flow would be between the first and last sentences in the list.\n\nLet me explain it for anyone who doesn;t understand what I mean...\n\nBiological creatures do not fall in a group. For a simple bacteria species, there is a lot of interdependence in the group but no one actually knows who is in it. And for one of those species who can produce as many bacteria as he needs then he does not know by whom the bacteria are coming, whether from another species, from the environment or even the same strain. And those bacteria get to the end that they can not control", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "How do you take a cast of experienced, well-known actors, tell them the story of their life, and the story from all parts of their world – both good and bad, and then ask them to come and play, live, for three hours? What if the actors are as talented as the best actors we get in film or theatre these days? What if the actors can inhabit their characters like they live them, that we forget we are watching actors?\n\nIt has taken three years to find out. And in the process, we have learned some hard lessons.\n\nOne lesson is that a script can be rewritten. After we had read thousands of pages, it became apparent that only a few words, even at the highest levels of English, had been selected. These were the words that would take you from one page to the next, and let you live the lives in the characters. They were the words that would give the film a story.\n\nA second lesson is that film is never a real documentary, no matter how many of the stories are true. They are filtered through the imagination of film-makers. The words of all those who lived and worked in the past are in the story. It is the truth; yet the films are real. The actors speak as they were led by the story they believed, not as they were told.\n\nWhat had been thought impossible now became possible. For the first time in years we had people coming up to the set after three-hour shoots, not to report how hard it was but to report that those they had just met were living, breathing, and acting as themselves.\n\nA third lesson was about relationships and trust. Everyone who works together – directors, actors, writers, cameramen, designers – can, on the whole, trust one another and can always be relied upon. But even the most experienced actors can’t stand each other, no matter how much they love what they are doing.\n\nThe fourth and most important lesson is that as soon as any actor decides to accept an offer to play another person who does not agree to be played, there is no telling where that character ends and that is starts.\n\nThe actors are a family, who come together not only to look after each other in practical but also in emotional ways.\n\nOver the past three and a half years we have all put ourselves at the mercy of the film-makers, and in so doing have shown that the most experienced actor could – just – lose, but could not betray, his acting and his integrity.\n\nSo now, the most experienced actors have got together. They have a script – an outline, actually. They have all had three-hour shoots. And they are ready to play. We have been working with a team of some of the most experienced actors in the world.\n\nSome of them are actors who have never played on screen before. They all know how to handle themselves and how to act.\n\nAnd they are at ease with each other, which is not always the case, as there is no script.\n\nEach has to have an individual set-up, but there is no script to be followed. They are all together on one set, but there is no film crew – not a sound or a gaffer. It is one film, but no cameras. We have no crew, nothing in the world to help us to make it better…\n\nSo we have worked to improve the existing script we had – and then developed our own script with new characters, new faces and new problems and conflicts that we had never seen before. We have got so far in the process that we have not yet even seen the original screen.\n\nSo now, the most experienced actors have got together. They have a script – an outline, actually. They have all had three-hour shoots. And they are ready to play. We have been working with a team of some of the most experienced actors in the world. They have all got their own individual sets. They know each other well. They are always looking out for each other. They work together, but apart.\n\nThe whole of London has been invited. People from film, stage, radio and TV, from London, across the world – a very small group – but they come. These are the actors who can inhabit characters for three hours. They can be who they wish to be: brave, heroic, mad, foolish for all that. But even as they live, breathe and act as themselves, they can make them up, as they wish them to be.\n\nThe script is the most important thing. Everyone involved had the script. No one can argue with that, for the script is the foundation of each film, without the script the film would be incomplete.\n\nBut the script also contains the ideas of the writers. For the writers create the story, which, in turn, shapes the script – and creates the characters we have created.\n\nSo we had", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "Clearly, some tumors evade the immune system and go on to form metastatic foci in non-sentinel lymph nodes. We have also reported that in a tumor cell line, the T cell growth factor receptor (TCF), the Eph/ephrin protein family of receptors and their associated ligands are essential for mediating metastasis^[@R14]^. Here we report, using the same transgenic mouse, that a small amount of radiation-induced tumor immunity is sufficient for inhibiting metastasis using the same T cell epitope as the tumor vaccine, and that this induction of lymphocyte memory is dependent on local inflammatory changes that occur in the primary tumor environment^[@R15]^.\n\nWe first examined tumor metastases in this mouse model and found that this model had high metastasis rates. In one experiment, we found that tumor metastasis had occurred in 16 out of 20 primary tumors (80%), and that when radiation treatment was administered on the day that tumor cells were injected, then metastatic tumor lesions were found in 9 of 13 mice (69%). However, when we compared mice that underwent only the initial tumor injection/immunization (with or without radiation treatment) to those that received only the immunogen on day 21 post-tumor, metastatic tumor lesions were found in 0 of 15 mice on day 21, compared to 3 of 15 on day 16 ([Extended Data Fig. 1a,b](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This indicates that the small amount of tumor cell killing from the initial immunization (with a low dose of cells or even one immunization) is not sufficient to eradicate cells from the primary tumor, leading to metastasis. Rather, there must be a high number of tumor antigen-specific lymphocytes at the time of the initial immunization/tumor injection to be able to eradicate a metastatic lesion.\n\nIf we consider the hypothesis that radiation can only lead to a subset of cancer cells to die and become dormant, then we can consider that the primary tumor cells may go through a state of 'progression'. One of the characteristics of cancer cells is that they can not only proliferate to generate more cells, but they can also alter their cell-surface receptors to become more resistant to the immune system. For example, cancer cells are known to upregulate anti-apoptotic receptors such as phosphatidylserine (PS), downregulate the Fas receptor, the T cell receptor (TCR) and other immune-related molecules to enable them to evade the immune system^[@R16]^.\n\nSince radiation-induced tumor immunity is dependent on lymphocyte memory, we examined whether the same radiation therapy could lead to lymphocyte memory. A similar irradiation and adoptive transfer method was used to induce immune memory and tumor immunity, and we used a tumor cell line, EL4 thymoma, as the target cell to induce primary lymphocytes for memory studies^[@R17],[@R18]^. The irradiation-induced cancer mouse model had a similar level of lymphocyte recovery two weeks after the irradiation treatment as the other T cell transfer mice ([Extended Data Fig. 1c](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These results indicate that the irradiation was able to induce tumor immunity from the irradiated tumor vaccine with the same T cell epitope (1--6), but not from the same TCR (H-2^b^). These two models were also able to provide protection from tumor metastasis when the mice were challenged with the EL4 tumor cell line two weeks after the irradiation treatment or two weeks after a primary tumor injection through adoptive transfer of lymphocytes ([Fig. 1a-c](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [Extended Data Fig. 2a](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [b](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}), demonstrating that a cell vaccine with the same epitope-specific TCR may elicit tumor-specific lymphocytes. We previously reported that primary tumors from the EL4 tumor cell line in which the TCR had changed into a TCR with a lower affinity (H-2^d^) were highly resistant to rechallenge with tumor cells from the same origin (H-2^d^), although the same tumor cells were not sensitive to immune stimulation^[@R17]^. When we repeated these experiments with EL4 cells, we found that they were also able to induce lymphocytes with memory against the antigen and were resistant to rechallenge ([Extended Data Fig. 2c](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We repeated these assays using tumor vaccine cells transduced with the TCR H-2^b^, and also did not find any resistance to tumor rechallenge ([Extended Data Fig. 3a-d](#F7){ref-type", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "background : oral squamous cell carcinoma ( oscc ) is extremely rare. The patients often suffer to serious discomfort and loss of normal hearing which make us often avoid surgery to remove oscc without any hope of recovery or survival. We here report our 8 years' experience of performing partial removal surgery of oral squamous cell carcinoma by use of modified radical neck dissection after complete preoperative diagnostic work-up.\n\nCase Presentation\n================\n\nA 46-year-old female was complaining of a lump on her left side of neck. Asymptomatic, she also suffered from hoarseness and sore throat. A biopsy showed oral squamous cell carcinoma ( oscc ) without any metastasis. Due to the non-specific symptoms, biopsy was not considered as a definitive diagnostic procedure, but because she lived in a rural environment the physicians who treated her did not use the biopsy results in the diagnostic pathway. The patient was treated with a combination of chemotherapy (cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin, and oral docetaxel) and irradiation as well as a combination of surgery (radical neck dissection) and postoperative radiotherapy. During radiotherapy, a left side neck mass appeared and radiotherapy was stopped. After completing radiotherapy she showed no signs of growth of the neck mass. She was considered as having no distant metastasis or cancer extension. Her TNM stage was stage IIB, and the tumor was classified as oscc. She was not given adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. She was followed for four months (February, 2008 to July, 2009) after the initial treatment; we observed no signs of recurrence.\n\nCase\n====\n\nSince June, 2009, we were informed that her head doctor suspected that there was still a small chance of recurrence. She still has no signs of recurrence. We decided to discuss our options with this patient. Since she did not want radical surgery, we decided to conduct a partial radical neck dissection, preserving the parotid and submandibular glands, and reconstructing her left side of face (Figure 1, 2).\n\nFigure 1: Preoperative frontal view of the patient.\n\nFigure 2: Preoperative lateral and postoperative frontal view.\n\nSurgery\n=======\n\nThe operation was performed under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively the operating table was raised and two drains put on the parotid and submandibular glands (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3: Intraoperative photography of the tumor excised by partial radical neck dissection.\n\nThe skin and the surrounding soft tissue of the neck were prepared with 0.5% chlorhexidine and soaked in an iodine solution. After cleaning the wound we then cut a strip of skin of 2 cms wide and 5 cms deep length. This strip of skin was removed in the middle of all five edges to be used on the other side ([Figure 4](#f4){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nFigure 4: Photograph of 5 cm long skin strip used for the reconstruction of the left side of the neck.\n\nTwo holes were first drilled in the strip and pulled in the same direction like in suturing ([Figure 5](#f5){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nFigure 5: Intraoperative photograph and photo of the wound closure.\n\nThrough these two holes a single 5-0 nylon suture was passed in the same direction as previously and another 4-0 nylon suture placed through the four other holes ([Figure 6](#f6){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nFigure 6: Photograph using the sutures passed through the two holes on the strip\n\nA strip of skin was also placed on the floor of the operating table and draped to the wound and left side of the neck ([Figure 7](#f7){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nFigure 7: After the wound has been sutured down to the floor of the operating table and the skin has been placed on the wound and left side of the neck.\n\nUnder general anesthesia we performed a modified radical neck dissection and a large strip of skin with the suture technique (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8: Intraoperative photography of the large skin strip used to create the left side of the neck.\n\nThere is no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis in our postoperative pathology report. The area of the left side of neck was measured to be 4.7 cm × 4.5 cm.\n\nWe performed three type skin flaps for the reconstruction of the face because one of her two eyes also went blind due to a cancer metastasis (primary intraorbital malignant melanoma) to the left frontal lobe of her brain ([Figure 9](#f9){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nFigure 9: Photograph after", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "Every \"Garb Day,\" as the triplets call it, they wait by the roadside for the return \"of their Garbs\" (garb? Is it garb? Or are they the people with the garb? They have no idea.)\n\n\"I don't see why they have to come back every day, to be exact. We don't have a problem with it,\" says Mrs. Green, a middle-aged woman wearing a floral headscarf on the morning of the seventh-annual \"garb day.\"\n\nThe triplets have recently become the first members of their town's Muslim community to attend a \"garb day.\"\n\nA recent poll (conducted among Turkish citizens living in the Netherlands) found that 53 percent of them support the wearing of the \"burkini.\" (In English-speaking countries, the term burkini is a term for a swimsuit that fully covers swimsuit-clad part-breasted women.)\n\nAs for the Dutch \"burkini controversy,\" it's a tale that could take years to unravel. A Dutch judge on June 23 placed an indefinite ban on anyone in the Netherlands in possession of a \"burkini,\" which is a reference to the burka, an Islamic-style veil worn by Muslim women in the Middle East. (The ruling cited \"national security reasons.\" The judge didn't explain or justify his decision.)\n\nThe problem with this decision was the lack of evidence for the judge's reason. The problem is the Netherlands now has a ban on the wearing of all burkinis, by all citizens—Muslims and not (for now). This makes the Dutch case at least two thousand times more complicated than the case against the First Amendment and the right of free speech, the right to keep and bear arms, or the right to public assembly.\n\nThe question for the people of the Netherlands is this: Are the \"national security\" reasons for the judge's ruling because the Dutch are Muslim or are the \"national security\" reasons a smokescreen for their being a bunch of racist, Islamophobic Nazis?\n\nAfter all, if a German judge could ban all German neo-Nazis for life—and then call them racists—would it take the national security exception to justify such a decision?\n\nThe problem with the Netherlands case isn't just that there is a debate about the rights of non-Muslims—this isn't the first time that there has been a debate about those of non-Muslims. The problem is the lack of evidence that will justify any ban of the wearing of a burkini in the Netherlands. This will only become clearer as the case unfolds. The problem is in the question: How could the ban have any \"national security\" reason?\n\nTo be fair, The Hague has always had a history of restricting the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms. But what about an issue that has gone unsolved for a century?\n\nThe case of the First Amendment of the Constitution was settled the early 1900s, in a dispute over a tax. The First Amendment states: \"Congress shall makeNo law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nAnd then the famous \"case\" was filed in federal court in New York Supreme Court. A baker refused to give a baker's dozen of a man's wedding cakes to the man's daughter. As a citizen, the woman would have been able to carry the cakes to the baker in the town where the wedding was held and buy them. The judge ruled in her favor. He then ruled that \"a federal court cannot declare as unconstitutional a state law which does not conflict with the [federal] Constitution.\" The baker refused to comply with the judge's ruling, and he sued.\n\nThe Second Amendment is the right of a citizen to \"keep and bear arms.\" The judge in that case didn't rule in favor of the citizen, but he did decide that the state law had no conflict with the Constitution. But, in fact, the judge was ignoring the First Amendment. The judge had ruled that in a \"free society\" the Second Amendment's ban on the manufacture and sale of guns in the U.S. didn't apply to the citizens who own their own guns. He then ruled that it meant that in a free society no one in America could keep and bear arms.\n\nIn other words, the judge ignored the word \"Free\" in \"free society,\" to state that a citizen (or a government) can't own a gun.\n\nHowever, that case—called District of Columbia v. Heller, in 2013—didn't prove that there is a right to keep and bear arms. It proved that the government had the right to deny gun owners their Second Amendment right to a gun.

{"text": "we explore the possible tie between the naturalness of having a child and having children.\n\nThe naturalness of having a child.\n\nLet’s start by considering the most general aspect of naturalness: to what extent being born without one’s parents is natural.* First of all, we can’t take any such notion as a standard: it is not a stable individual characteristic, it is a process. The child is born and dies as an individual human being. In terms of any standard individual characteristic (say, height), there is plenty of room for other people. All people are human beings and we have to accept that. We don’t have to adopt a universal view on having a child. Having children is not a standard characteristic that we have to “standardize”. We should be in agreement on the definition of ‘having children’ – even if there are many variations in definitions in various cultures.\n\nSo, in this aspect, there is no need to accept a universail standard to which we should have to “standardize”.\n\nIn the second aspect, the person who was born in the absence of his/her parents is an independent human being who is not (at least so far as he/she is able to recognize and act upon) attached to the parents. This independence is a result of the biological and social mechanisms responsible for making him/her a human being. The parents are the natural environment in which their son/daughter has to grow – it is a complex, inter-related process that takes into account the child’s biological predispositions as well as the environment, society, etc., in which the parents live. We are born into a complex, interrelated social system. That’s the second aspect of naturalness: the process is non-trivial, non-arbitrary, not predetermined. It is not a fact that we can “just” decide to accept or reject certain types of people as parents without being in the process of a long and complicated process, without first being able to understand and then accept the process. It is an interaction between the genetic and environmental processes. So, this person is not a victim of circumstances or bad luck.\n\nIn the third aspect, there is the sense in which it is not easy to say that a person is a victim of circumstances and bad luck. Consider a situation in which there are two parents, one has been born blind, one is disabled and the disabled one is not considered beautiful. In such a situation, one could say that the disabled child should not be born; a mother could say the same about a disabled child born with no legs; one could assert that the disabled child is a victim of circumstances and bad luck, the other could argue that the disabled child can learn to cope with the situation. So, when we think something is the result of bad luck it is because someone is trying to convince us that this is so. Bad luck is understood in such a way, whereas in the case of people who have been born blind or deaf, bad luck is something different. We are used to thinking of bad luck as the result of bad judgement, which is also how we think of all other accidents or misfortunes. In the case of someone who was born blind, you are trying to convince yourself that he/she was not able to take advantage of the good opportunities in life. You are not so much trying to convince yourself that his/her life was “bad” or that bad luck played a role. You are trying to convince yourself that bad luck (with respect to the child) played a role in bad judgement.\n\nThis is a different way of thinking. The fact that someone has been born disabled doesn’t mean that the parent didn’t have a chance in life. They were able to learn the skills of a normal human being without any difficulty. You can argue, then, that one person should not be born blind and another person should not be born deaf. But there is a big difference between the two examples: in the first example, the disabled person doesn’t have a right to life. He/she has a chance to a normal human life and, if he/she is not happy, there is no point in making him/her live a “perfect” life in which circumstances are not at play. The second example is the opposite: the disabled child has in his/her existence no right to life whatsoever. The child never had a right to a normal life – what right did the child have to live free of disease, in what way could the child have taken advantage of the right to a normal life? What right did the child have to live as you and I live? This is an interesting point. Can we say that there are circumstances in life that we have to “accept”, the circumstances in which we have to live, so", "label": "gptneo"}

Soon I was sitting in the dark in the small theater, with a cigarette sticking out of my lower lip.\n\nI remember staring out of the dark at the dark theater, wondering how everyone came here to see this film I was sitting in.\n\nA man came in with two seats on a dolly and began to lower the seats. He worked slowly, methodically, as if he didn’t want to scare us—even though no one was afraid of anything.\n\nOnce in, we all went back the way we came.\n\nThe movie seemed like John Cassavetes’ most successful movie. It has all the ingredients. It begins in San Francisco, and then we go north, south and east.\n\nAfter the first half hour, everyone seemed to fall into the rhythm of the movie, but I sat there, not believing everything I was seeing. The film is funny and tender and sad at the same time.\n\nEventually the story began moving in a direction I had never expected.\n\nThere are not many films that use the first-person experience to the fullest extent. “A Woman Under the Influence” is one of them. The feeling of the characters as people you know is so good that when it ended I found myself in tears. I also remembered that I hadn’t cried in a long time, and it hadn’t helped me much with my job, so I couldn’t exactly blame that thing on film.\n\nFor years people would talk about how great “A Woman Under the Influence” was, and I remember telling everyone how much I thought it was great. So you can imagine how surprised I was when I picked up the Sunday newspaper and saw the name of my favorite John Cassavetes film at the bottom.\n\nI didn’t read it immediately, but I didn’t want to miss it either.\n\nI finally did read the letter. It’s very clever and it is in the movie for good measure. I wish I could have seen it, because the script is so clever and it had such a good ending.\n\nTo be honest, I’ve often wondered, though, if there was an actual movie out there about what happened to this woman in this way?\n\nI think she was a bit confused. I believe she was trying to get to the San Francisco set, the Hollywood set, and then the real Los Angeles set. It was her ambition. She wanted to be a star. She even wanted to be a movie star.\n\nShe didn’t succeed, or wasn’t happy, or got sick and died, and in a way I am grateful that the real film came along and showed how many of her dreams went unfulfilled.\n\nI’ve always thought of “A Woman Under the Influence” as a portrait of a woman trying to become a star, but not succeeding.\n\nI’m glad the real woman didn’t become a movie star because a real movie star would be just as unhappy.\n\nJohn Cassavetes had some good films, though. I’ve thought about him a lot. When I go see a film by John Cassavetes, it’s like reading a book by a book author. In the words of Jack London, “A book by a dead poet.”\n\nWhen somebody dies, when you look over his or her body and you see the life behind the life, you forget about the words.\n\nIn the case of William Henry Chase and the life, “A Woman Under the Influence” still gives people the chance to laugh a lot.\n\nI’ve seen so many people laugh in the movie—even though it’s sad. It’s also sad for me, though, because I remember when Cassavetes thought that film was going to be so amazing.\n\nEveryone loved the movie at the time, but it never got made. Many movie people saw John Cassavetes, but they didn’t see “A Woman Under the Influence.”\n\nYou can bet I’ll be sitting at the back of the theater on opening night.\n\n—\n\nI’ve watched it almost six times.

{"text": "imaging in the restframe ultraviolet has proven to be an extremely powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, and for the very first time, we can study the Lyman Break systems in the restframe UV continuum at high redshifts. First studies in this wavelength range have focused on finding and measuring galaxies and Lyman Break candidates by directly subtracting their expected Lyman alpha forest [Ly$\\alpha $\\;]{} forecasts (e.g., @shapley01; @hayes01 [@pettini02]; @adelberger03 [@adelberger04]; @stark06). Unfortunately, these UV continuum imaging results are of low contrast (e.g., @shapley01). We will see that this contrast increases significantly when the Lyman Break systems are considered in their entirety.\n\nWe focus on the restframe UV continuum imaging that has been done in this wavelength range [@stark06], with observations being performed by the MMT and the WHT, utilizing the same multi-object spectrographs and the same CCDs. @stark06 use their data to image spectroscopically selected Lyman Break candidates with Lyman Break Imaging using a slit of 30 (or 120) from the MMT, and also images spectroscopically selected Lyman Break candidates with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 which covers a much larger wavelength interval. The spectrographs that were used on the WHT and the MMT are described in @cooke96. We chose WFPC2 to probe into the restframe UV continuum for the following reasons: (1) HST has better spatial resolution and sensitivity than ground-based CCDs can deliver; (2) most of our Lyman Break candidates were detected by HST and the ground-based telescope can also help us to characterize the morphology, kinematics and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the galaxies. The final three images in our study have been published in @stark06. Of the three spectroscopic samples, the second (WHT) sample has the least reliable S/N because they did not have enough time on the HST to cover all of the possible regions in the field of the galaxy down to their desired depth, i.e., 60 – 90 mag. The third (MMT) sample has S/N and the highest redshift in their sample, so it is the best possible combination for measuring the restframe UV continuum. We note that the galaxies covered by both HST and ground-based optical spectrographs can vary greatly due to variations in stellar population, age, and extinction (see @stark06).\n\nIn the current studies, the continuum images have been constructed from the measured flux in the $R$ and $I$ band, and the broad-band photometry comes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS: @york00 [@beers90; @stoughton92]). In [§\\[sec\\_spectra\\]]{}, we will describe the broad-band photometry, and then explore the various possible continuum images in the restframe UV continuum in [§\\[sec\\_compare\\]]{}. In this paper, a complete Lyman Break system with all four colors in the restframe UV continuum is a new result; the first to be published in the literature.\n\nLyman Break Candidates and Selection Techniques {#sec_sel}\n===============================================\n\nWe will present three types of Lyman Break candidates and their associated continuum photometric selections. First is the Lyman Break candidates that we are directly comparing with the Ly$\\alpha$ predicted spectra. In this case, we can compare the Ly$\\alpha$ and Lyman Break predictions directly. These galaxies are not necessarily associated with the Lyman Break galaxies because the Ly$\\alpha$ emission is from very young stars that contribute to the Lyman Break population without the Lyc emission. For the purpose of measuring and comparing the two Lyman Break systems, we have selected only one of the colors, $M > -18$, (see Fig. 1) as a threshold for our analysis, because it allows for a simple comparison as is presented in [§\\[sec\\_compare\\]]{}. In other words, we are choosing the $M > -18$ selection as both galaxies are dominated by the Lyman Break luminosity so that we will have sufficient counts to analyze their restframe UV continuum without the contamination from [Ly$\\alpha$ ]{} emission from young Lyman Limit systems. The restframe UV selection also yields many additional selection criteria without having to be biased by Lyman Break absorption features as they are the result of strong line-absorption of H I along the line of sight.\n\nA second type of Lyman Break system we can", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some areas of the world, including the Bahamas. They are often found in coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ctenophores are an ancient order of animals.\n\nThe earliest fossil ctenophore is a 3-millimeter-long crustacean called Auloposeidon from the Kimmeridgian Period in the Devonian era in North America. These large animals would have covered themselves with spines and fangs as a defense mechanism against predators. This primitive life form is considered a major transitional animal from one stage to the next evolutionary step.\n\nA Ctenophysoidea is a ctenophore with four eyes on each side of the head. The ctenophore's tentacles are very long and curved. The color of a ctenophore is often purple. Ctenophores sometimes use their tentacles to attach themselves to surfaces, such as rocks and corals. Ctenophores use various methods of motion to capture prey such as with their tentacle contractions, the rhythmic muscular contractions of the head and tentacles.\n\nCtenophores use their tentacles to trap small prey or to attach. When the victim is small enough, the ctenophore folds its tentacle around it and closes its mouth, locking the seal with one tentacle and then the other, creating a partial vacuum and preventing escape. When the prey escapes, the ctenophore opens its wide mouth and throws the prey into its stomach to be digested. Ctenophores also use a variety of chemicals to immobilize their prey and induce fear in prey and prey predators. This process is known as pufferoo, in which the ctenophore spares its prey and is then preyed on by a pufferfish or a squid, which is known as a puffer. Ctenophores can kill, but usually only when caught in a net.\n\nA Ctenophore does not have any true legs. Its legs are short in form which increases its swimming speed. It also has a flexible foot that is not attached to a single segment, allowing the animal to move more easily in shallow water and in the dark. The animal's eyes and tentacles give it depth perception.\n\nCtenophore is a member of a vertebrate group known as Bilateria, which includes all the fish, the sharks and the cephalopods. Ctenophores are the only known exception to the rule that vertebrates are all bilaterian animals. The largest ctenophore, known as the blue-spotted jellyfish (Calyptra planorbis), can reach up to 4 m in length, while a common Caribbean jellyfish, the Caribbean goby (Eulamprus quoyi) can reach as much as 18 m. However, they usually only grow between 3 m and several m in length.\n\nA small number of Ctenophores, the Heterotrachodontid ctenophores, are known to be capable of self-medicating and may use this ability as a defense mechanism when threatened. This ability is also known as a \"behavioral defense“. Self-medicating animals are usually poisonous, but some are less toxic than others. It is difficult to determine which organism is actually doing the self-medicating and it may be a camouflage behavior, or may simply be a response to the presence of another, more toxic organism.[citation needed]\n\nCtenophores make up about 10% of all animal taxa, and are diverse in their distribution. About 4,250 species, most belonging to 5 genera, are currently described, but some, as many as 2,000 species, are yet undescribed. The Ctenophore order makes up the majority of ctenophores in the world, representing 40% of the total number of marine invertebrate species. Species of Ctenophore include a wide variety of shapes and colors and range in size.\n\nThe largest Ctenophore is the blue-spotted jellyfish, the largest animal at 5.88 m (20 ft) tall. Some smaller species include a red-spotted ctenophore (Cyrtopodium euxenii) which can be up to 1.8 m long and is found in shallow water in tropical areas, and a yellow-spotted ctenophore (Hydrobia ulvae) which is about 3 – 4 m long and has a wide mouth. They produce a thick orange goo when they die. Some of the smallest ctenophore is the green ctenophore.\n\nThe life span of ctenophores ranges from a few months to 1-3 years, depending primarily on the species. Most live in shallow waters. Many other animals are thought to be allies of ctenophores, including the octopus[34][35],", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "we study the dynamic behaviour of a quantum two - dimensional system - one of them is classical (Euler-Poisson constraint) and one is quantum - in order to find their dynamic stability properties under perturbations and how far they will go. We will show that both classical and quantum models are dynamically unstable. We study a model quantum with only attractive nonlinearity and linear spring constant (\\[euler\\]) and find that it is statically stable. The same is true for a second model, quantum with repulsive nonlinearity and linear spring constant (\\[rep\\]), which is also dynamically stable for the first perturbation order. For the third, classical model, the first two perturbation orders are considered and it is seen to be dynamically unstable. In the first case we do not deal with any repulsive terms (\\[epr\\],\\[repp\\]) in the nonlinear potential (\\[nli\\]) and in the second cases we add repulsive terms in the potentials (\\[repk\\],\\[rep\\]).\n\nThe plan of the paper is the following. In section 2 we introduce the physical systems we will deal with. In section 3 we derive the system of equations of motion and their solutions, including the perturbations. In particular we study the solutions of some exact equations corresponding to the classical and quantum models, and the perturbations of them. In section 4 we apply our method of solving equations of motion to these models and find their dynamical behaviour both for the classical and quantum systems. Conclusions are summarized in section 5.\n\nPhysical systems and equations of motion\n========================================\n\nWe will assume that the system we study is a classical (or quantum) model of nonlinear harmonic oscillator, i.e. equation of motion for a quantum mechanical particle of mass $m$ moving in the one - dimensional classical system. The classical system of one - dimensional harmonic oscillator (considered as a perturbation) is described by the following equation of motion $$m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=K_x=\\frac{dx}{dt}\\left( \\frac{\\Gamma\nx^3}{1+\\Gamma x^4}-3x^2\\right),  \\label{oscillx}$$ where, here and through the whole paper, $x$ is the displacement of the particle along the direction of motion $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $t$ is the time.\n\nAn alternative model of one - dimensional classical system is given by a second order Hamiltonian (or nonlinear) partial differential equation of motion where the nonlinearity comes from the kinetic energy (\\[oscillx\\]), $$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+K_{x}\\frac{x}{(1+y)}=0.    \\label{oscilly}$$ Here $y=\\frac{dx}{dt}$ is also a function of $t$ (the Lagrangian coordinate and hence the Hamiltonian) satisfying the first order partial differential equation: $$\\frac{dy}{dt}+K_{y}=0=\\frac{dy}{dt}\\frac{\\eta ^3}{1+\\eta\n^{4}}-3y^2,   \\label{oscilly1}$$ where $\\eta \\left( t\\right) =\\frac{\\Gamma x}{(1+\\Gamma x^2)}-1\n\\;$ and $\\;y(t)       $, its derivative. The function $x(t)$ satisfies equation of motion (\\[oscillx\\]) and $\\;y(t)$ satisfies (\\[oscilly\\]) with $\\eta =1$.\n\nIt is usual to study the behaviour of solutions of equations (\\[oscillx\\],\\[oscilly1\\]). One of the most simple and general way to do it is to linearize them about a fixed and chosen reference trajectory [@kol1; @kul]. In order to do this one needs the Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian) $L=\\frac{1}{2}\\dot{x} ^2\\gamma _{1}(x)+u$ with $\\; \\gamma _{1}(x)=1+2\\sqrt{1+\\left( x-p\\right)}$ where $x$ is the coordinate along the classical trajectory, $p$ is the canonical momentum and $u$ is the Lagrangian kinetic energy, where $p$ and $u$ are considered as independent variables.

Material and Device\n=======================\n\n[Figure 1](#f1-sensors-13-14247){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows the basic concept of the two-step procedure of material and device design. In practice, the material is the active component of a device and the device is its active component. In a conventional device, the material is the active component. The basic architecture or structure of a mechanical device is illustrated in [Figure 2](#f2-sensors-13-14247){ref-type=\"fig\"}. A mechanical device comprises a lever, a fulcrum, and the arm and is generally symmetric with respect to the axis of rotation. The fundamental and primary role of the mechanical device is to enable a certain action to be performed, which consists in the movement of (a) the arm in relation to (b) the fulcrum in such a manner to affect a change in some value of the system of coordinates. In addition to the fundamental role of the lever, the basic structure of the device includes the fulcrum that supports the arm. The basic role of the fulcrum is to prevent the movement of the arm in the forward or backward direction because if the arm is allowed to reverse its direction, the system of coordinates will change in such a manner that the initial set of values of the variables describing a state of the system will change, and this will be contrary to the nature of the system in question. The system of coordinates will continue to change as long as the arm continues to move in the forward or backward direction. Any attempt to reverse the direction of the arm will cause the arm to move on to such a position that it is now at such a distance from the fulcrum that it will not be able to perform the desired action because it will no longer be able to cause the required change in the values of two or more vectors belonging to the system of coordinates. Hence, the arm has a limited working range and the design of the device that enables the arm to move in the forward or backward direction requires the development of the device so that the working range of that arm is not changed as the arm moves against the fulcrum from position to position. If the arm is given a positive, constant velocity, it will perform the desired action in the forward direction as much as possible; however, the arm will not be able to move into the backward position that is required if the velocity of the arm is reversed.\n\nAnalogous to the function of the lever, the action of the arm and fulcrum will usually be such that movement in the direction orthogonal to that direction produces an increase in a certain property of a system being defined. The system of coordinates in the system of axes (*x*,*y*,*z*) will have a value *x*′, *y*′, or *z*′ at the point of origin on the side of the origin corresponding to axis *z*′, the line *z* = constant. The system of coordinates in other two axes will vary depending on the value of the *x* and *y*. The three properties that result from the movement of an individual point in the *x*, *y* or *z* axis in relation to the value *z* = constant are: (i) the distance is increased, (*ii*) the orientation of the line joining this point to the origin point is altered, and (*iii*) the angle by which the line joins the origin point and the *z* axis is altered. In the three-dimensional space that is bounded by the four sides corresponding to the sides of the cube with the side corresponding to three axes (*z*, *x*, *y*), the change in the values of the components in a system of coordinates will occur along an arc joining the point with the origin to the point opposite to the *z* axis, the line *z* = constant. The angle between two axes will increase with the increase and decrease in the values of the variables along the arc.\n\nThe action of the two-dimensional movement of the arm and the orientation of the arm will form an image of the position of the arm along the *z* axis as shown in [Figure 1](#f1-sensors-13-14247){ref-type=\"fig\"}. In the process of scanning the *z* axis, the *z* axis needs to be scanned at some degree of inclination such that as the *z* axis is scanned from a fixed scanning range along the *z* axis, the", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "Having been a Marine, I can tell you that the hardest thing to live with is depression. I don't say this to brag, though. I really mean it. The hardest thing to live with is the self-hate it causes.\n\nI was so proud to be an infantryman. They called us the hard men of the world. The Marines were tough. In many ways we were tough, but we were not tougher. We were also soft and soft like children, and we hated ourselves for it.\n\nWe thought we were always right and we were always right and we were forever right, and we believed we were better than the world and all its people. Our lives were like a dream and the only reality was the one God had given us in the form of our training and service.\n\nThe trouble was we didn't understand what it was to be truly alive. We thought we were still in an ideal scenario, where there was no real pain, just an ideal pain to overcome. We didn't understand that pain was real even to the person who didn't even know it. We could suffer in our idealistic dreams, but when we woke up, the misery was still there. The pain was not just an idea in the future. It was the reality of what we had made of ourselves. We lived in a dream that was also our reality; our reality became our fantasy.\n\nIt was as if we were really living in the first chapter of the book of Genesis, where the Lord said, \"Behold, the man has become like one of Us, but I have not found him.\" (Genesis 3:19) We really thought we were the one who would know and see clearly His face.\n\nI tried to remember God's face. I tried to remember the face of God. I tried so hard to make sense of my life, my circumstances, but what I could remember most was the face of Satan.\n\nAs a child I was always a little scared of Satan. He was the biggest, meanest, most evil being in my universe. I thought of him as a sort of God; he was like God on top of the Mount of Transfiguration.\n\nAs I grew into the Marines, I thought of Satan as a great captain of an ugly, giant, evil company of soldiers with their funny little haircuts and funny little dog. I knew better than to get on Satan's level, but I never quite figured out how to do that. He was always talking about us. He would say, \"This is the toughest of the tough. That's not the real tough. This is the real tough. You don't understand.\"\n\nWe were always the tough part. We were always first, and always going to be last. We made our lives easy and we didn't make life easy for each other. On the downside it meant we fought more. We died more. We were not the most moral company. But we had always had enough to keep each other happy and make life tolerable in the service.\n\nA lot of people would say, \"I'm so ashamed of what I did. I didn't know. I should have stopped at home. I should have had some sense, but sometimes things just happen. I should have had some sense, but sometimes things just happen.\" That's a human excuse. And it's a lot of excuses.\n\nWhat's more, it's a lot of excuses because most Christians have become so comfortable in their sin that they are numb to its realities. I remember in our training on the day our platoon was selected for a combat tour, I was so sick of listening to the drill sergeants when they told us it would be a three-month tour—three times longer than we deserved—that I stood up, looked the sergeants straight in the eyes and asked, \"Do you have any idea how much I want to go and be a combat commander? This is worth a year of your training. I will not be a company-leader and a platoon-leader and a company commander. But if you want me to sit here and listen to the drill sergeants talk—that's what I'm going to do.\" Those sergeants were scared, and I was sick of listening to their fear. I wasn't going to sit here and listen to any more fear.\n\nMy desire to be a combat-kicker meant my desire to be a leader. It forced a confrontation with the fear that had been a part of us from the beginning.\n\nOne night the senior drill sergeant took me aside to talk to me. He said, \"I think you know how I feel about you. I know how I feel about you. This time when we go, we go full-out. We'll get to where we are not because you were scared.

{"text": "Laminated sheets give instructions for using the materials in the teaching module of the new course.\n\nIn the new course, materials are given only for a limited period of time (e.g., one credit-hour or 45 minutes in a 5-hour classroom period) and do not go beyond the point at which the student is certified. This feature enables you to evaluate the material offered in a given class from the student's perspective. This way, you can assess the effectiveness of a teaching module or, after your evaluation, develop a new teaching module.\n\nThe new class is taught only in the classroom setting. Therefore, as well as teaching in the computer lab and library, the students receive instruction in the classroom (as a form of the library lecture). This means that if the new course were taught outside the classroom, many of the materials would have to be prepared in advance.\n\nThe new class is only taught in the classroom setting. Because the students do not receive instruction outside the class time period, there may not be a good deal of time in which to develop their learning and practicing skills. Consequently, as well as preparing a new course, you should give the students a substantial amount of time to practice the new course in the classroom.\n\n**Using materials in a new course**\n\nIf you decide to use the materials in the new course in a different way or manner than was originally envisioned, you must make the changes in your syllabus and assignment instructions carefully, including the new changes in the list of materials, the description of the material, the format and frequency of the activities (e.g., make sure there is sufficient time within the class time frame), and the assessment of the material.\n\nAs you develop this new course, you will want to consider how to make the course activities different from the previous version of the course. If you can change the materials and activities substantially (without changing the assessment), this can improve the effectiveness of the new course. After you put the materials into a new format, consider developing a few new activities that can be performed during the class time frame (for example, at the start of the class time frame). Try to find activities that will be fun and require the students to participate actively.\n\nThis is not a time to start over with an entirely new approach. Remember that although you may be redesigning several aspects of the course, it will take time to produce the materials and to develop the activities. It is critical that you take time and a few days to plan, evaluate, and then develop a new course.\n\n**Learning and practice**\n\nMany of the learning and practice strategies suggested in this chapter can be used in the new course. First, be sure to take time to learn and practice the new approach that you are developing and then, after this work, develop new activities for the new course.\n\nIf you decide to use the same materials and activities for a few new activities that are similar to those used in the previous course, these practices can then be used to create a new course with a different approach.\n\n**The syllabus**\n\nThe final step in developing the new course is to develop a syllabus consistent with the new course and that explains clearly and clearly defines its objectives (both short-term and long-term). The syllabus must be written clearly and concisely so that students can write and reference the syllabus. The syllabus should be organized and developed so that a student can develop a self-contained knowledge (rather than a knowledge that is built on concepts or principles).\n\nOnce a syllabus has been developed, assign the course to one or more students as homework. The syllabus is designed to assist the students and not to provide a curriculum for every student to follow.\n\n**Assigning homework**\n\nIn general, the homework assignment list should be divided by instructional time into three types of assignments: (1) readings for the students; (2) group work; and (3) exams. It is good practice to plan assignments this way: for example, each assignment in the first month (reading and group work) or week (exams). As homework assignments are developed, the instructor may use a check list that allows students to complete each one of the assignments. This checklist should include the following elements:\n\n• the assignment to be given to the student;\n\n• the type of assignment, including how to mark the student's work;\n\n• the name and telephone number of the instructor or someone who is qualified to teach the course;\n\n• instructions on how to complete the assignment;\n\n• a set of suggested practice activities (for example, note taking, problem-solving, problem-solving in groups, presentations, discussion;\n\n• the grade that is expected for each assignment that is not provided by gradebook (see Section 2.2.3);\n\n• the expected time within the class time frame.\n\nFor", "label": "gptneo"}

Even the creator of the main character makes no attempt to defend his actions other than to say how his actions were misguided and how he does not regret his decisions. Why? It just does not make any effort to find out the author name, how the character is defined or any information about the character's background. It just goes straight to action.\n\nThere is no character development or any effort at all to build this series because that is not a priority at DC and it's not important at Marvel either.\n\nWhich isn't to say that that is a bad thing. The writing, the art, the dialogue and the storytelling is very good. The characters even have some quirks that made me laugh out loud. The story is not at all bad. It's just not as good. In fact, in my opinion the art is slightly better because when I noticed the issue number, I was surprised to see I was getting 12 issues. So I figured I would have only just one more issue to go, but I was completely wrong. It's not just the art, it's everything else.\n\nAt least with other new IPs the creator of these characters does not even have to justify himself. The writers must already know who wrote what and why and when they start, so when they come to finish one more issue, they won't have to justify themselves with excuses and explanations, but with a story, character development and character evolution.\n\nIf there's one thing that Marvel has going against them it's this issue is this character.\n\nYou're forgetting one thing.\n\nThe only way that you, or anyone for that matter could tell who wrote which other character is a) They just do not take the time to find out whose writing skills match theirs, and b) in the case of an event with multiple creators, then the writers have to be assigned to one-by-one, where as a team all working on a single character would have at least some chance of finding out who was the one responsible.\n\nWe have been getting this sort of thing for 5 years now. The writers who wrote the Avengers know and admit who wrote what but say never once did they mention it and the only time they're even hinting that they might be responsible for that character is when they're writing it in an interview. At least they have a chance to get some input, at least they have to acknowledge in some way what went into it and what the reason for it was.\n\nI have read almost all of the X-books (or some of them anyway) and even though I enjoy the individual stories, I just can't get this one out of", "label": "gptneo"}

Keep up the great work (I hope you will still manage to convince the british government to let you take it to the next level!)\n\nMy only small suggestion is to put in the status bar of the import box the number of formats I have, so I'll know if I have more than one version on XDCAM (if that option is made available after the final version).\n\nAnother small suggestion is that the status bar at the top should also say \"No export to file\", so that I know to keep the XDCAM import box empty, for now.

Maybe after I finish to build the software (to check I can actually start testing), we should be able to see if they fix a lot of bugs (and some of my favorite bugs).\n\nWe should know a few bug-fixes today/tomorrow:\n\n1) the new format has some minor bugs (on the side of the new format. I know one should have made some tests first, but we can wait and see if it's really a bug (or just a small one).\n\n2) The new format is working better on some files. After a couple of days test, it is working almost perfect (except for two bugs on XAVC-I format).\n\n3) The new format will give a better quality (better color, better exposure, better focus, better lighting, better video) after a few more days of test.\n\n4) When the conversion program will be ready - we have to wait few hours to evaluate the quality of the conversion, maybe we have a big bug on the conversion itself.\n\nI think I explained well what I want to see here: a first batch of conversion of files produced with the beta format that should be finished soon. After some more weeks or several months, we could have the final format ready and tested.\n\nI will test the new format, but I don't know if it's really correct (for now!).

{"text": "I've just watched Fingersmith, and I'm stunned to see the lack of any of the \"old school\" elements that fans remember. Not sure what I'm watching as the quality of the graphics? The music? Or the acting?\n\nThe biggest difference, I think, is the graphics. But it's not just on the graphics, either. The characters look like they're from a different video game, all of them--all except for the one in the back with the helmet on. For some reason I can't get over the lack of a weapon on the other guy.\n\nThe acting is pretty bad. In fact, it's good that I'm watching it with the subtitles because some of the things the characters do sounds very strange. In one case they're being called by a name. Is there any way they're saying 'Mort'? Not likely, but it might be from the \"MORT\" part in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nIn another case, someone has a pistol in one hand and a shotgun in the other. I don't know how they do that, I'd like to know. And, on a related note, what the hell was that thing? I guess I have no clue either, but I was sort of hoping to be enlightened about that by playing the game myself (or at least get an idea).\n\nI'm really starting to hate this game now. The graphics seem very low quality, the editing seems a bit amateurish, and the voice acting is not believable at all.\n\nI can't understand how this game was put together. From the very first scene I've always been intrigued about the concept and I think it will probably end up being a very good game - but as I've seen nothing to date (I didn't play the 360 version) I'd love to know how it was originally developed.\n\nI was expecting something quite different. I really like how you're able to take advantage of the console controls and the \"camera view\"- where you can literally shoot and use weapons to destroy all the enemies - and you have to go through a bunch of random rooms. It seems to me that a lot of developers don't bother with the \"camera view\" option- a lot of the controls are not all that intuitive, and it definitely is at the point where it's very hard to move around with the D-pad and keep the camera view in mind.\n\nI also like that you can \"move\" your character around to see some of the rooms and the areas through all of them, so it isn't just \"a room with a shotgun\" or \"a room with a pistol\".\n\nAnd the graphics-- I don't even want to talk about \"bad\".\n\nI think it will be a good game, but please do not rush something that will take a very long time to become a game.\n\nWhen I first heard about Fingersmith,I was a bit puzzled as to how it was put together. I mean the people who came up with this concept sounded like they were from a different universe.I mean it doesn't make sense as far as the setting goes and the story. But then I looked through it... the story goes on like this....the girl is running as fast as she can down a dark alley after somebody has shot at her and she ends up in this futuristic town only to lose the key and be forced to run and run and run...then she comes across this town's only doctor and he takes all of her medical needs for the night and she is forced to just give him some money so he will take care of any medical issues that arise,that she may ever face and he gives her some cash which he says she can take because she is \"running out\".So he took some of her money which she did not know about when the doctor told her he was going on a trip for the night.He then gives her a key to a town and a gun to a town of robots...\nOn top of that,the story goes on like this...a doctor...a robot...the town...a girl...a key...a doctor.I really do not know why this person decided to make something like this. This is just a bad idea... I would rather play a game with actual story and characters like a game like FarCry which I'm told really is very good. So, no story on this game for me. Just go shoot everything... and go look for a key... The game is called Fingersmith I believe and the story goes on like this.And the gameplay is just like FarCry.. you go through the different areas in each room (i.e. hospital, town, robot village) and then you try to kill all the people in that area.I don' t know if I should be frustrated or really enjoying it...\n\nthe voice acting is way to good for this game. it gives me a headache\n\nwhen i played as the doctor...he was not", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "Some modern scholars, such as Fielding H. Garrison, are of the opinion that in the days of the Hebrews an empire was created but that it was small and a series of independent empires that grew from it into something more than a small monarchy.\n\nThis interpretation seems somewhat problematic since it contradicts what we know from archaeological findings. According to excavations at Tel Megiddo some of the city's population may have lived in a more primitive way of life than the people of the surrounding land. Tel Megiddo was an important urban center in the 6th Dynasty, and may have served as its capital. Megiddo may well have belonged to a network of cities that made it an important cultural center, that was of a much higher caliber than Tel Dan. Furthermore, the presence of a number of large pottery jars along the shores of the Dead Sea, dating to the 6th or 7th Dynasty, indicates the existence of an urban population who cultivated the necessary plants for their diet. One could argue that the urban center itself became the empire of the time. Indeed, the ancient records of the time clearly mention many independent cities, such as Megiddo, Baalbek, Hazor, Jerusalem, and Gath.\n\nIn the 6th Dynasty we encounter one of the key developments of early Egyptian history, the appearance of a new city-state, the capital of the empire. In the 6th dynasty, there was a great change in the political landscape in Egypt. For the first time we see cities become part of the political landscape. These cities not only had to compete for resources, but the city states needed to provide infrastructure to carry out their economy. At the same time, the state needed to establish an image of strength and power.\n\nIn the 6th Dynasty we can see both the appearance of a new imperial culture among the cities, and the establishment of new types of structures on a large scale, which included the large buildings, as well as the temples. The temples played a great role in supporting the economy; they served as places for social rituals that produced economic benefits by the social interaction taking place among the citizens. The large temples were an important part of this religious culture, and became increasingly important places of the building. They were used to support local religious activities and to produce income for the priests.\n\nAlthough the role of temples in the process of the construction of a new political and cultural order for Egyptian cities may seem contradictory, the evidence clearly suggests that the cities in the 6th Dynasty used their temples as building tools. The large temples were seen as very important places where the public could find their place. They were also used as places where the government could exercise its authority. The temples were important tools for Egyptian cities in order to change their environment, and they were used to construct an image for this change and their new image as city states.\n\nIn the 6th Dynasty, a number of large cities are documented, and they come to dominate the political landscape of the country. It is reasonable to conclude that one of the goals of the early Egyptian kings was to use these large capitals as tools, in order to support their economic growth. But the cities did not only have to provide large areas for the production of resources for the economic benefit of the people of the region. Also important were the large-scale construction of houses and buildings, which were important parts of the political ideology and life of the Egyptian people. The temples were the center of all these projects and activities.\n\nThese large-scale construction projects were a powerful symbol of the dominance of the central government in cities across the country, leading Egypt to become more centralized than ever before. In the 6th Dynasty, the urban centers became more powerful, and became a tool for the support of the larger political economy and the social structure of a nation.\n\nThe 6th Dynasty of Egypt produced some of the most powerful rulers in history. In the 5th Dynasty we see an example of a family that had the political initiative to produce the great Rameses II. According to Herodotus (I, p. 1078), his father was a priest, and his mother's father was of royal blood, making him a member of the priestly caste. But his power and charisma are more obvious from the fact that he is seen as the conqueror of some of the most important cities of the time, such as Cairo and Memphis. By establishing a cult to himself, he was both revered and feared.\n\nThe temple at the main sanctuary at Heliopolis, which was probably built by Rameses, is important because it marks the beginning of royal construction on a grand scale. The great temple at Heliopolis, which was built as an homage to Rameses and his achievements, was one of the grand temples during the Middle Kingdom. The temple was not only a place for great ceremonies, but it also served as a public building and as an important public and political center through which to project the image of Rameses II and his", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "we derive a formula for the quantum corrections to the free energy near the QCP and the critical temperature in both BCS model and the $BCS/BEC$ quantum phase transition. Our results reproduce, at the mean-field level, the quantum corrections to the phase transitions in the single-particle phase space, in which the critical temperature is controlled by the single-particle BCS gap. In addition, the calculations of the phase diagram of the model are improved by the quantum correction formula, revealing more details in the phase diagram. A further study of the model in the mean-field regime is carried out, where the critical temperature $T_c$ vanishes in the one-loop correction, and thus provides a new example of quantum critical phenomenon in the single-particle picture.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.\\[MODEL\\], the $BCS$-model and the mean-field description of the $BCS$/BEC quantum phase transition are introduced. Section \\[QMODEL\\] derives the quantum correction to the free energy near the QCP, including the $1/N$ effects. Numerical results and discussions are presented in Sec. \\[sec:num\\].

{"text": "All the way though i was thinking to myself \"\"Oh shit... \"\" as some parts of the movie were completely and entirely horrible. The beginning was a good start and then the plot went completely and totally bad, because why not. There were several things i'd normally like to complain about, but i'll address each part individually and get my thoughts out there.\n\nFirst off, this movie is extremely racist and shows no concern regarding the very important concept of race.\n\nSo what we see in this movie is that a group of people (white people) who want to get over on people (black people) so they want to kill them all because those people are not worthy to be in their'sons club', (this is the only explanation that the movie presents) start a new race called \"the white race\" because this is the only race that is better than the other one. And they make black people their slaves so they don't have to kill each other and get upset over racial differences.\n\nAnd then after making more white people their slave this race begins to use each other for anything they want, and as soon as there are no more black people to 'get a cut of' this entire race (the white race) turns into a bunch of racist, horrible, and sick people because they are fed up with blacks and the whole thing.\n\nI really wanted to like this movie, but everything i see (including some bad dubbing) made me just turn it off, it makes me look like a 'racist' (which i'm not, i'm just pointing out what i feel is wrong within the movie) and i don't have anything good to say, so i will just tell a story. Also this movie isn't my best, i'll admit but the last part sucked. I'm sorry i hate black people, (and to be honest i hate women as well (not in the movie though, they were all white, this is the first time i've really seen them) I am a homosexual, (but i never said i'm gay, lol)\n\nSo after the 'white race' murders a white woman (who is black) for reasons that make absolutely no sense they all turn into murderous racists and kill each other, and one of the two white people who survived this happens to get a 'cure'.\n\nNext thing the whole movie shows is the white people who turn to the black for protection, to save them from the racist group (this is the end of their lives, if you want to know the details about the movie please see my blog) and use them for whatever reason they want, which is what actually happens a lot.\n\nNow the two people who make the 'white' race stop eating babies, but not before he takes a baby 'white' person (this goes in a scene where they cut a baby's throat, the rest is blood) and then sets himself on the throne of their 'white race' by getting what he always wanted, (to be king)\n\nFirst they start using some of their 'white' people as slaves, first to be soldiers, but then are forced to become slaves of each other to get even with blacks. They set up prisons, and as soon as blacks leave in prison their children leave with them for no reason.\n\nAfter this they all become a bunch of racist murderers, but who is responsible for this group who are the most evil people in all of literature.\n\nThe last scene in the movie is a great one.\n\nThe end? Well, i guess like most movies it ends with a happy ending, so that's good, even if it isn't an ending that would make you sad and cry (it was a really sad scene in the movie, sad as any movie should be) But the fact that i won that movie is something i'm going to say 'thank you' for, so that means i'm glad that i didn't waste my time and money, and i was going to say goodbye to this movie. And i'll also say 'thank you' to this blog for telling me bad news about a great movie because i think that really hurts because i was excited to see the movie then i found out what i didn't like, and then i was ready to read this, only to see this post that talked about this horrible movie as if it was wonderful.\n\nI'll just say, i'd actually love if this movie ever got ported to an online platform (like Netflix, or HBO, or whatever) for me to watch it on for free, and i think it's a good idea for a movie that is so amazing and really needs to be seen.\n\nYou, me, and everyone we care about (and there are few) we love are all going to die at some point.\n\nI have no intention of dying before we do.\n\nThat is something i'll never lose, and the last thing i will ever have of any value is", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "In 1872, the Central Pacific Railroad established a station near present-day Loma, California called a terminus or hub, to serve transcontinental traffic. It was the first major railroad west of the Mississippi River, and it gave birth to an era of railroads and transcontinental travel that continues to the present day.\n\nA terminus or hub was in many ways the precursor to this modern era of rail travel, as it was the beginning of a rail line that connected with other branches from one point to the next, and provided rail access to points west that hadn’t previously had connections with east by rail. The route to the Pacific, and later the Transcontinental Railroad, was made up of three different rail lines. The first, from Sacramento, California, to the Oregon coast, was a single track of 4,400 miles (or about 5,500 miles under current estimates), with each branch added after the Sacramento run. The second was the route from the Pacific coast to the Mexican border in present-day Northern California, and for many years from 1872 to 1885, was owned by the Central Pacific Railroad, and extended to the border. This link was the line to the east.\n\nIn 1886, the first transcontinental train of the new Transcontinental railroad, the Golden State Express, used the original section of the Pacific Railroad from Bakersfield to Vallejo, California. The Bakersfield-Valley Ford branch was completed soon thereafter between 1886, and 1887, connecting with a branch from Pueblo, New Mexico to St. Louis in the US Midwest. The final stage of the Pacific Railroad route to the west began in 1901, and finished in Chicago, Illinois. The last segment of line from Sacramento, California to St. Louis was completed in 1888, making it the world’s longest single-track railroad built solely to support transcontinental rail service.\n\nThe route of the first transcontinental rail road was an important early rail link that contributed to the development of the western US. With a history spanning over a century, the Central Pacific Railroad and its predecessors are the oldest continuously operating railroad in North America.\n\nThe Central Pacific Railroad’s route through California is a fascinating, intricate and controversial story for which there is little historical record. While much of the Central Pacific’s history has been lost and little was known about either its early years like the Santa Fe, the Santa Fe Railway, which started operation in the Santa Fe Canyon area of northern New Mexico in 1861 and ran to southern California in 1865, until the early 20th century.\n\nThe Central Pacific Railroad, as we know them today, built the first route across the Sierra Nevada in 1870 to serve trade with the goldfields in southern Southeastern California. Two years later, Congress authorized the creation of the first transcontinental railroad. The transcontinental railroad was created on February 1, 1869, when President Andrew Johnson signed into law the Pacific Railroad Act of Congress created a transcontinental railroad route through territory from the southern border with Colombia to the Canadian border on either side of the 49th parallel and beyond. The Act of Congress was then codified into law by the United States’ Congress and later signed by Andrew Johnson himself. The Central Pacific was created to build and operate such a railroad. The first locomotive of the Central Pacific was on April 24, 1872.\n\nThe railroad was owned by California’s governor, Judah P. Benjamin. Benjamin was elected in 1859 for what was then the state Senate. At that time, the railroad was the main supplier to both the state and the nation of cotton. Cotton was a key export of California and the California economy had grown significantly in the 1850s, leading many to look to the railroad for transportation.\n\nThe Central Pacific line was completed in 1873. In 1875 and 1876, the Central Pacific completed two new bridges over the San Joaquin River and through the Sierra Nevada. Before the construction of the railroad, the route crossed the main trunk of the Sierra Nevada with many narrow cuts through the mountains to access the southern route. The tracks reached a peak elevation of over 14,000 feet. (The highest recorded rail gauge used at any point on a train is 3-inch, used by the Nevada spur). The route through California was one of the first true transcontinental routes to be built.\n\nThe Central Pacific built a route through and between California, from Sacramento to the Mexican border, and then through Bakersfield, bringing in over $5 billion in business for the Southern California region. Central Pacific locomotives carried passengers in California and carried mail for much of the rest of the US and Canada.\n\nThe route was completed by 1870, creating routes to the West Coast in California and from Sacramento to the Oregon Trail. The route would later be the basis of the transcontinental railroad with the completion of the final stretch to the border of California and the West Coast of the US in the 1890s, bringing", "label": "gptneo"}

The first is that with its two teams owned by minority owners, it can’t afford to go as deep into a market as other MLS expansion teams, nor can it afford to remain in any market that has been designated as Major League Soccer. The second is that as USL and MLS clubs are set to play their home games outdoors at the same time, they will in theory drive each other into each other’s arms. The USL is concerned how the schedule will work out with MLS games overlapping MLS games — even non-MLS markets — with the league’s schedule. And by “overlap,” it specifically refers to overlap with the U.S. Open Cup in which MLS matches are slated to coincide with USL matches. The third issue facing USL is that USL is not only a growing league that has a new ownership group, but its top team, the Wilmington Hammerheads, currently plays at the Carolina Challenge Cup, a soccer tournament held at WakeMed Soccer Park and broadcast by NBCUniversal Sports and Soccer United Marketing. That tournament attracts all the key soccer power ratings, too — in Charlotte and Raleigh at least.\n\nIn all, the USL’s leaders are very concerned that MLS teams are taking over too many markets, and are taking their USL teams away from them. It goes against the whole model of a professional sports league to take on a soccer-specific stadium of USL status, a status that should belong to the top level of the sport and shouldn’t be owned by the bottom level.\n\n[MORE Soccer | How USL gets deals]\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, all eyes went to a press conference featuring Mayor Michael B. Williams of Charlotte and MLS Commissioner Don Garber. On the line right along with the two, MLS Commissioner Don Garber repeatedly invoked both the Charlotte Hornets and the Charlotte Bobcats, referring to each as “rivalries.”\n\nThe real question for MLS will be, when the league is finished with its three-phase plan in that three-market system, does Major League Soccer leave enough of the Charlotte market alone without worrying about a competitor trying to go into those same markets?\n\nGarber’s answer was a blunt: “No. We will always compete with all the leagues.” It was not an offer to stay out of Charlotte.\n\nBut it did point to another reality. Garber’s answer only underlines MLS’s need to make sure Charlotte is protected from competition. Garber is being a realist. He has said the number of expansion teams in MLS is capped at four, and that any expansion teams will come from existing markets. But he has hinted that even with those four – the Philadelphia Union, Orlando City, Miami Fusion and St. Louis FC – one MLS franchise could come from outside the league.\n\nGarber has a point. The most talked about of the four teams under consideration is Miami FC, a young team with a unique identity, and one which is more or less the equivalent of the Minnesota United/Real Salt Lake set-up. The NASL would be forced to come up with a new name, as there is no existing brand that the league has to use for the league as a whole. But Garber’s point is, if MLS does not want Miami FC to take over and fill all of the seats in Miami’s venues in the next decade, it would have to take a stronger stance on having MLS teams in Charlotte, Houston, San Antonio and Detroit. These four markets were the original six markets awarded to Major League Soccer — if MLS can’t protect at least one of them, a deal on a similar basis to this one that gives MLS the Charlotte market would likely still be in play.\n\nIn the end, it isn’t going to matter whether or not MLS is willing to be open about not being able to take over the Charlotte market. It is not going to matter, either, how much money MLS wants for a soccer-specific stadium project in Charlotte. The answer is irrelevant. It is not going to matter, either, whether or not the team is a potential MLS expansion team or a rival USL professional soccer team: Garber is saying, in the end, that if MLS can’t protect Charlotte, MLS is going to put all of its eggs into the same basket of USL competition, and then whatever comes of that, it is going to come in the form of two MLS clubs or one.\n\n", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "meynet & arnould ( 1993a ) have suggested that wolf pack structure in the southern U.S. and northern Eurasia is the result of random selection. From an evolutionary perspective, this theory has important implications for the origin and spread of the wolf. If all packs are structured randomly, then the possibility of a large genetic bottleneck in the ancestral species should be low. Such a genetic bottleneck would result even in the face of genetic drift for over 30 million years. This seems unlikely. However, several studies suggest that genetic Bottlenecks are occurring with rates of the order of 10-30 times larger than the ones observed from human societies. The results of these studies have implications for the wolf as an evolutionary model.\n\nA more radical hypothesis, one that is attractive in light of our understanding of genetic bottlenecks at the level of species, points to an alternative model (Hansen and Neel (1999)) in which wolf gene flow, at both the individual level and as a gene pool, has resulted in a pattern of genetic Bottlenecks. In this case, one cannot expect the wolf to evolve any more rapidly than other species, since genetic Bottlenecks might well have occurred on an unprecedented scale in wolf evolution (Arnould and Miethe (1999)).\n\n(b) The genetic Bottlenecks in the history of wolf evolution\n\nIt remains to be seen how the observed number of genetic Bottlenecks might change due to a more realistic model of the past. There are three reasons to have hope for this. This first is that in most cases, the number of genetic Bottlenecks that occurs is in fact fairly consistent with a genetic Bottleneck model (Hansen & Neel (1999); see also Christensen et al. (1993)). Second, if we accept the idea that most genetic Bottlenecks are indeed the result of a genetic bottleneck, then genetic bottlenecks are a simple, efficient and parsimonious mechanism for generating the observed patterns of genetic Bottlenecks. And third, this mechanism may well capture the dynamics which produced the patterns of genetic Bottlenecks.\n\nSeveral explanations for the patterns of genetic Bottlenecks have been offered. Two major types of explanation focus on the ecological and genetic mechanisms leading to or generating genetic Bottlenecks. The ecological explanation (Miethe (1997); see Arnould and Miethe (1999) for a review) relies on the observation that genetic bottlenecks usually occur in populations where there is a large drop in density. As pointed out by Miethe (1997, 1996, 1998), genetic bottlenecks can be caused by several mechanisms. For example, genetic drift can occur in very small populations and result in a lack of genetic variation. In such a case, the bottleneck can only be explained by natural selection (see e.g. Hoberg (1997)). Genetic bottlenecks caused by gene flow, on the other hand, should be more likely to occur in the larger species, and genetic bottlenecks should be more common in non-breeding than in breeding individuals (Fisher et al. (1996)).\n\nThe second type of explanation for genetic Bottlenecks focuses on gene flow, and specifically, on differences between sexes and between populations. The question is: why are there genetic Bottlenecks among individuals of the same (breeding) population but not between individuals from different (non-breeding) populations? The answer must, obviously, be in part to differences in allele frequencies in the different populations. Genetic Bottlenecks due to differences between populations have been observed in several species. The patterns observed in a number of studies have been suggestive of migration. However, it must be emphasized that such patterns have generally not been interpreted to support a significant contribution of migration. As K. Christensen and T.R. Pregill described, the patterns of genetic Bottlenecks in wolf, coyote and black vulture populations have been used to support an explanation for genetic Bottlenecks other than migration (Christensen & Pregill (1993b)). However, a recent study has shown that these patterns might well be consistent with the existence of gene flow and immigration from source populations (Arnould & Miethe (1998)). As suggested by these authors, genetic Bottlenecks due to gene flow might well have been present all along.\n\nThe second type of explanation for genetic Bottlenecks focuses on genetic drift, and specifically, on differences between populations. As outlined by several authors, a number of empirical studies have suggested that differences between populations are more likely to result in genetic Bottlenecks than similarities between populations. For example, in the wolf population investigated in this paper, there are genetic Bottlenecks between the eastern and southern U.S. populations. However, genetic Bottlenecks between the U.S. and Quebec populations appear to be uncommon. For the eastern population,", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "The Fringe act Dolls, who work with the Cirk LaForge medical-research company, are forced to work with two new strange, deformed patients: one is a young woman, the other is an older man whose head, neck, and hand are missing. During his therapy sessions, LaForge and Doll undergo tests in which they are sent into the body and mind of their respective patients, who then enter the bodies of others. LaForge’s tests are complicated and show how their patients’ psychological and physical profiles evolve in ways that are difficult to predict. When they return to the base, their tests reveal that their patients will be the subject of further experiments, forcing the researchers to go back to Dr. Doll’s laboratory for more funding.\n\nWith the help of the Fringe act, Dolls learns that her patient, the young woman, is not actually human, but possesses the abilities of a time-traveler; that the man being driven mad by his therapy sessions is in fact, her father who accidentally destroyed his brain and was sent back in time to the year 2000 to rescue his daughter, but did not succeed; and that he is slowly working to send LaForge back to the year 1000 in order to get the funding that they need that would cure their experimentally induced diseases. When LaForge sees the man who saved his life, he mistakes him for his father.\n\nLaForge, Doll, and their various medical experiments cause a sensation among medical personnel, the media, the public and each other among others, causing LaForge to find himself and his life under an unprecedented amount of scrutiny. It’s a rollercoaster ride for all of them that is constantly in their way.\n\nIn short, it was a complete waste of time. There were too many plots, ideas, and the whole story would come back with a vengeance if it were in prose. It was more than a little annoying to start with: how long does it take to see these types of details (the time to write, actually, because we have been reading so long, what I forgot to do, etc.) – and the fact that the writing is not nearly as good as it could be, just that they put in too much and the writing is at times choppy and clunky, as well. For a time I hoped that the story would end in a cliff hanger and that their characters wouldn’t be quite as interesting to follow on as they might have been, as well: I was disappointed.\n\nI really wanted to love this book (I even mentioned my review of The Secret Circle in my Goodreads reviews for Christmas, but I didn’t want to be as harsh as that book, so I didn’t tell you, I just thought). However, as soon as I started reading it I quickly realized that I’m not the kind of reader who will like to read many sci-fi books that are filled with crazy time dilation, alternate versions of history, and time travel, but I do like good dystopian novels, and I read them all the time, but I prefer to read fiction than nonfiction, so I tried my best to ignore my desire to read this book.\n\nAnd then we got to the conclusion. And I just wanted to cry. The conclusion was okay, honestly – I got some little plot points thrown out, but it was also okay. I do like to think “that one idea was not thrown out, that was just put in, and I’m not sure how it ties in” – but the actual story ended with no new characters being introduced, no new ideas being presented, and no information being given away. The only interesting part was how people were being tested, since the test centers have been under the control of the Fringe act for a while now, but that’s not really an interesting thing to me – I don’t have a huge interest in medicine, and in fact I do not understand how the experiment worked or what those medical procedures really mean. I just have little interest in the medical field in general, and I didn’t even find the medical part of the story very interesting – it just made it not very interesting to read, and I didn’t understand why there were so many things about the testing of the experiments, or what they really meant, and they were always talking and not explaining what was being tested, and they never seemed to even get back to the point where the main person of this story was right there, so that was kind of cool, and I found out bits of things through the trial and error but I would say that part was kind of boring and not interesting, and there weren’t very many important things in the story, and I feel like they wasted way too much effort. This, by just the ending alone, was enough for me to give this 1 out of 5 stars, not because the story itself was bad, but", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "DirecTV Group (DTV) has a big call to make on Wednesday. On the heels of some very impressive quarter-over-quarter revenue growth that left them with $14 billion in net revenues for the third quarter of 2012, the company is calling on its subscribers to share in that progress and go even further.\n\nTheir message is that the biggest change this quarter is how they handle the content. The most obvious way is by adding channels. To accomplish that, they had to get the biggest merger of any cable company. That means they now have Disney plus ESPN plus HBO and Nickelodeon to build their business on.\n\nAfter three years of spending billions on network programming like ESPN, TNT, The Weather Channel and Disney ABC cable channels, the move to add the big three was an aggressive one and I was a little surprised that DirecTV kept doing it with such limited media offerings.\n\nDirecTV doesn't have quite enough content to fill the new channels, but it would have been impossible for them to try and squeeze it all out as long as the cable guy wanted to charge more for it.\n\nBut that's not what we're hearing from DirecTV. We're hearing from a source who worked on one of those Disney channels and has been talking to them for five weeks without any indication that they haven't yet had enough content.\n\nIf they had more content ready -- which we hear is the truth -- they would be building more, just like a grocery store needs product more than once a week.\n\nThis one is bigger than the $14 billion in net revenues that we heard from the company this morning but they say it's not nearly as big as it was in January 2012 when they had $19.9 billion in net revenues.\n\nBecause they had the big merger and now get the extra Disney channels, they now only have to sell the stuff to their customers. And that means they will sell more stuff, meaning we'll see more commercials in the future.\n\nOn a related note, the Wall Street Journal is doing some research on this and the top headline on the report is: \"Comcast’s DirecTV Is Having a Harsh Reality Check.\"\n\nI'd link it but I won't, but if you dig deeper, you'll find that it takes some of the breath away from DirecTV's $5 billion in net bookings and some of its $4.2 billion in net profits in the quarter compared with the year before and that their margins are starting to creep back up, but not anywhere near the 50 or 60 percent that should make them a serious cable operator.\n\nHere's a question: why aren't they a serious cable operator?\n\nOn June 27, we posted this story to let you know the first of 13 predictions that analysts are working on for DirecTV.\n\nHere are some the top predictions for DirecTV that should become fact:\n\nPrediction #1: DirecTV's subscribers will have to pay for all online and mobile content.\n\nThe most shocking part of this one was right away: it came out of Comcast.\n\nIn the third quarter, they were spending $5.2 billion a year to pay Comcast to give them just about 200 hours of video. Comcast gets all that video at no charge to the subscribers.\n\nWhile it gives them content like their TV, it also gets them the traffic when you get onto their website and their streaming video service. That's another free service.\n\nThe only way for you to truly get rid of this traffic is to drop cable TV.\n\nOf course, you'd also have a little less content as well as TV, which Comcast doesn't mind giving.\n\nPrediction #2: DirecTV will become a one-call provider to get everything you need and nothing you don't.\n\nIn a world like this one, you have to be a one-call provider. You have to have a one-call option, so here is what they're doing: they're taking away any cable to cable and internet to data service.\n\nSo, if you want more content -- which would be nice -- you get less of it -- all paid for by this one call. That's the first part.\n\nPrediction #3: DirecTV won't make any other moves in its current business.\n\nThe second part is that with so much content, the cable guy's going to have to let go of so much. He's also probably going to get squeezed by so many options.\n\nPrediction #4: DirecTV is going to have to make changes on the content side of their business.\n\nThe two ideas here are that we'll see more of ESPN and the ability to pick up things like TNT. That's the second aspect.\n\nThe other part is that they would be better off having ESPN at a decent level going directly to them to give them $", "label": "gptneo"}

MR of both wrists was performed with DWI and T1-weighted images showing a heterogeneous lesion involving both proximal carpal bones with mild cortical erosion at both wrist ends without destruction of the phalangeal bones. No soft tissue mass was identified at both wrist ends. After 6 days of corticosteroid administration, the swelling had regressed and the plain radiographs showed complete disappearance of the swelling without any osteolytic change. DWI MRI and T1-weighted images did not show significant change in the lesions of the right wrist with the administration of corticosteroids. Plain radiographs of both wrists showed significant osteolytic change at both wrist and no soft tissue mass was identified at both wrist ends. After 6 days of corticosteroid administration, a new erosive lesion with increased cortical erosion at the distal carpal bone end of the right fourth right finger (9) was found. These findings were in accordance with the clinical and radiological features. The diagnosis was DIP (osteosarcoma, intraosseous type 2). Pathological features showed spindle-shaped cells and moderate amount of osteoid (Figure 1a,b). Immunohistochemical study showed that these cells were the mature osteoclasts (Figure 2).\n\nDIP is a rare but aggressive variant of Ewing sarcoma. It has the same histological features with Ewing sarcoma but is not derived from Ewing sarcoma stem cells. To date, DIP remains the only reported case of intraosseous Ewing sarcomas. The diagnosis is made by characteristic radiologic findings (paratragic erosions with well circumscribed masses and osteolysis), and a histological test for the expression of the Ewing sarcoma-associated fusion gene (FLI-1).

Patients suffering from severe neurologic deficits or in whom epidural injection therapy yields unsatisfactory relief of the leg pain, might undergo lumbar laminectomy with laminoplasty. During the laminectomy, the facet joints are removed from the lamina and the remaining bony vertebral material is excised to create a solid fusion mass. While laminoplasty helps restore the patient to normal activity level and helps restore functionality, the risk of complications, such as infection and nonunion, is always present. These and other complications that might occur, if the technique were improperly performed, must be considered during the lumbosacral fusion as well.\n\n#### Laminoplasties {#cesec30}\n\nLaminoplasty is one of the most commonly used surgical techniques for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. In laminoplasty, facet joints are cut at the lamina and the remaining dural tissue is cut and retracted. Thereafter, autologous cancellous bone is inserted between the bony blocks. Autologous blood vessels to the bony spacer are also harvested. When the lamina is filled with bone or marrow, a solid bony fusion is achieved. When the bone that was obtained from the patient's iliac crest has been processed into bone marrow, this autologous bone marrow can be used for the replacement of all or part of the spinal column, which leads to complete regression of the symptomatic spinal stenosis and recovery of normal back function.\n\nCONCLUSIONS {#cesec31}\n===========\n\nThere are numerous techniques for lumbar spinal decompression and stabilization, and each modality has its own inherent advantages and drawbacks.

{"text": "it has been widely shown that the cosmological parameters and primordial power spectrum $\\mathcal{P}_{s}$ can be constrained by combining the CMB observations. This is mainly due to the fact that the CMB observations are not necessarily tied to the properties of the dark energy. However, in some regions (namely, very small scales $k_{\\star}\\ll aH(t_0)$[^3]), the properties of the dark energy and the initial perturbations are nearly the same, which is in contradiction to the existing theoretical understanding. In order to have a more definite picture, in this subsection we will take into account the effect of the dark energy perturbations on the CMB. We will further show that we can constrain the equation of state by combining the CMB data and the Hubble parameter information.\n\nWe first assume the scale factor is given by $a(t) = \\left[1-\\epsilon(t)\\right]t$, where $\\epsilon(t)$ comes from the dark energy in the universe, i.e., $\\epsilon(t)=\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)=-\\ddot{\\epsilon}(t)$, where a dot means Euler integration, since we consider a universe with zero-index Dark Energy. It has been pointed out in the literature [@Zhao:2016dzp; @Zhao:2016hpx; @Geng:2016tnn] that the model proposed in Eq. could only fit the data of low $\\ell$ or high-$\\ell$ temperature combinations. However, our results suggest that the equation of state $w$ can be fitted by combining the temperature and polarization anisotropy data. The reason is that, in the slow-roll approximation, $n_{s}$ is a conserved quantity (see Eq.) and $\\epsilon$ is very small at $t<t_{0}$. Therefore, the equation of state $w$ should not be too different from that of the non-relativistic case with $\\epsilon\\ll 1$. Moreover, this case can help us understand the difference between dark energy and dark matter.\n\nNow we further estimate the effect of initial conditions on the CMB observation. We first consider the evolution of perturbations in the $n=0$ case. For the sake of illustration, we will take the parameter as very small $\\epsilon=0.1\\Delta$ (i.e., $0=1-\\epsilon$). Our results show that the effect of initial conditions does not change the order of magnitude at the subhorizon scale in this case. In order to show this, we plot the ratio of the ratio of the perturbations and the ratio of the $w$ value between the case with $n_{s}<1$ (dark energy with $w<-1$) and the case with $n_{s}>1$ (dark energy with $w>-1$). The ratio reads as $R_{1}(n_s)=\\left[\\frac{R(1+\\epsilon)-R^{-}}{R^{-}-R^{-1}}\\right ]\\delta_{s}^{2}+6n_{s}\\Delta/\\epsilon^{2}$, which only contributes in the interval $n<2$. We take $R_1=R^{-}_{1}(n_s)+6n_{s}\\Delta/\\epsilon^{2}|_{n<2}$, where $R^{-}_{1}(n_s)=1$ in the case of $n_s>1$. The curves are obtained by numerically solving the linear perturbation equation.

{"text": "the cell envelope of mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) is essential for replication in the body ( 1 ). Mtb encodes an intact lysyl oxidase homolog; a non-homologous protein D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase system; and outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). OMVs contain several cell wall proteins: lysines exposed to the cytoplasm, outer membrane proteins, a mycolic acid backbone (2, 3). We sought to identify the membrane anchors and subcellular localization of the cell wall proteins in OMVs. Phagolysosmal fusion of Mtb OMV with macrophages was used to investigate OMV membrane localization by immunofluorescence. OMVs were isolated from a mycobacterium deficient in cell wall synthesis ( 1, 4 ). Electron and light microscopy of bacteria cultured in the presence or absence of n-acetyl-L-cysteine showed similar cell morphology and mycolic acid in the cell wall, but no cell lysis ( Figure 1 A, left: enlarged cell with two round holes in the cell envelope, right: mycobacterium growing without cell lysis). Immunogold labeling localized lysines and esterase activity to the cell wall ( Figure 1 A), but did not label OMV preparations. An immunoblot probed with antibodies against outer membrane proteins ( lysines) revealed bands corresponding to the lysine-sensitive protein band in the cytosolic fraction of Mtb wild type during growth in n-acetyl-L-cysteine (1). In contrast, there were no such bands in the wild type strain grown without n-acetyl-L-cysteine (11,4). These results indicate that the mycolic acid in the outer membrane and in the OMV is covalently linked to cell wall proteins and OMV glycoproteins. Therefore, we used the antisera to these cell wall proteins to immunolocalize the cell wall proteins in permeabilized OMV preparations by transmission electron microscopy. OMV lysates were labeled with anti-lysine antibodies and electron-dense particles were observed in the OMVs ( 12 ). Figure 1. OMV immunolocalization of lysines. Lysine-sensitive, mycobacterial species were grown in either the absence or presence of n acetyl-L-cysteine. The cells were cultured on a bacteriological agar plate. Subsequently, the cells were lysed and OMVs purified. Lysine labeling and immunoelectron microscopy was performed. Representative areas (1/4 mm2 and 1 mm deep) are shown with the corresponding enlargement (10 μm). The cells on both sides of the section were labeled with antibody against Lysine protein. The scale bar = 1 μm. Figure 2. Immunogold EM of lysine labeling after permeabilization. (A) OMV immunolocalization of lysine-sensitive proteins. OMVs were labeled with anti-lysine antibodies followed by gold-gold conjugation.

{"text": "The first item of business on Wednesdays is usually Time Capsule Day. I like to get the children involved in this activity. Here is a picture we took, using an antique ’33 Ford Sedan from my parents garage. My grandmother has many of our old autos in her garage. This is probably our fourth attempt to start it, because the first couple of times the kids all over the place and they couldn’t get the car going. The first time we used a tractor to start it and this is why we have a lot of rust! So we resorted to the car and waited.\n\nAs you can see, we ended up getting the car started!\n\nThe next few items on the agenda involve books, music and art projects. In this next post, I’ll share how we started a collection of books that we’ll take on road trips. This is an idea for a road trip to the Bahamas to visit our grand nephews. We will be using this idea to make a mini library to take on our next trip to Texas.\n\nWe visited the art room a few weeks ago to select paint colors and get some ideas for a garage sale art project. I’d love to know what ideas you suggest for a car, garage and art room decorating project that you would plan for our next visit.\n\nWhen it comes to the books, how do you choose what to read? I’ve always had a problem with choosing what to read. The problem is I usually don’t know what to start with, so it’ll always be on the back burner. There are many books that I read, yet don’t find that the reading of any other book interests me. This is a problem that we’re having on many levels and I have yet to be able to resolve it. I want everything I read to be relevant to my life, yet it is very challenging to read several hundred pages of a book without having any interest whatsoever.\n\nI’m still working on this problem and have found that I really need to have a ‘go to book’ before starting on a new book. I’ll share a few books in the next few posts, including some book suggestions from our kids. I hope you find these ideas helpful as you consider this problem that I have.\n\nIn any project, the first requirement is planning. My first thought was to start by creating our book idea, so we’d have a lot of materials at our disposal, but that idea didn’t work. Then I’ve thought of starting our project with our garage, but that still didn’t seem to cut it. So we kept brainstorming a new idea.\n\nEnter the challenge: planning each project according to your idea, then working that plan into your real life activities.\n\nWe did just that.\n\nHere is the list of projects that our garage and kitchen will be used for. Now we have to determine which projects will be included. Next it will be up to our kids to choose what activities they like and to incorporate them in our project.\n\nThe kids chose art activities and began making scrap pieces for paint. They cut out paper, then glued them into tiny ‘bins’ about 1/4″ high.\n\nThey used a spray bottle to get the white on the bottom of the paper to blend in with the color, making them look like they were painting with a marker.\n\nWe used a can of spray paint to paint the back of the bins and also the inside, to cover the glue.\n\nWhile we were using spray paint to mark the bin, we also went to the store and picked up some water-soluble paint. This is really helpful if you are working with little kids. You mix a little amount of the water-soluble in a spray bottle, then you rub or squirt that mixture onto the surface that will be painted with water. It dissolves the surface coating and leaves an even washable coating.\n\nThis was the first painting of the project and the only part that I was able to complete in the car.\n\nHere it is hung in a garage, now with the paint. The picture was also in the books as part of the art project. This painting makes it look like it’s on display. We also took the picture of our grandchildren playing in the snow and hung that outside too.\n\nI did have this one project complete at home, but it was out of the house with the kids, then we moved on to the next project.\n\nThis painting is hanging in our garage. We’ll also use this idea for a book storage cabinet.\n\nWe did all of the book painting and shelving in the garage, but I found some pictures for photos. Our garage was the perfect setting.\n\nThe car was the perfect", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "It will be the 24-year-old's second spell with Reading, who were relegated from the Championship two years ago with just four wins in 12 games.\n\n'I'm not expecting to have the ball in my box,' said Cairney ahead of the Championship game against Nottingham Forest.\n\n'I like to have it where I want it and get into the right positions. I try and be creative because if I go a little bit more clinical I can do that. But I've always been a good finisher with the ball.\n\n'Whether it was the run out or on the break I was confident to put the ball in the back of the net and I've always been a threat from open play.'\n\nReading started as one of the better sides in League One, but their first half fell apart and Cairney was at the centre of it.\n\n'We tried to play a simple game in the first half but it wasn't up there with anyone else,' said Reading manager Ian Holloway.\n\n'They kept pressing us around the box at all angles and put plenty of bodies where their goal wasn't. It's an awful position and I think the referee took a look at that in the first half.\n\n'Every time we'd get a sniff they'd press up higher and higher and once they got a bit more pressure I thought we'd be in trouble.'\n\nAnd they kept on getting that close as Reading went on another run of nine goals in ten games stretching their unbeaten run to four matches.\n\nReading's James McClean and his left wing partner, Alex Pearce, also scored in their final league game, but Cairney wasn't the only one to score with an amazing strike against Forest.\n\nThis is a different Cairney to the one the Reading boss watched last season. He is more confident, much happier and has taken the captaincy off a player who won't be around for much longer.\n\n'I'm probably going to be more aggressive in the last ten games,' the man himself said.\n\n'You have to be clinical and if I'm not in the flow of things like I would like to be then I have to make myself a nuisance. That's where I get my chances and my success. I always like to contribute.'\n\nIt's the kind of season he may never again get.\n\n'It's hard to think of a player who has enjoyed a run like that and when I look at the players in front of me then it's not really good or bad at all.\n\n'This one is good for myself when it all comes to an end because I don't want to finish my career on a bad note. I'm trying to finish the season well and hopefully we'll be safe in the final game of the season.'\n\nIt can't be easy for a player who has got a contract to walk away and there's a real sense of pride at the end of last season when he picked up his final winner, his first of three penalty strikes since October 2009.\n\nBut there's pressure on all players to make a quick decision and be true to their career goals. Cairney has admitted this latest run could end in failure.\n\nHe said: 'It's not just the last few games of the season but the whole season. There's a lot of games and a lot of competitions so it could be a little bit hard but I'm not the type of player who can take things for granted, even when the season is so long at the end. It's a new start - the club's new owner and new management. There's a lot of pressure.\n\n'But I've been here for six years and when it's all over I'd like to do something memorable for them and for myself. So hopefully it will be that. I'm happy to stay for another season because it's been a good time.\n\n'I think the manager has picked the best line up ever and it will be another good season.'\n\nHis wife, Mandy, was at the training ground when he picked up the telephone to tell her. 'The whole staff were watching and they all said their good words of encouragement,' he said. 'They've gone a long way but you've got to do it. It was the perfect end.\n\n'It's not the end of my career but it's the end of something really beautiful, where I can be with lots of people, be at a club with a lot of fun. I wouldn't be able to do that for anywhere else but Reading.\n\n'The team has grown in size and strength every year and the support for the team has just kept getting bigger so I've started to take a little bit of confidence from that.\n\n'You just take something from every occasion you've been at and it's just another game to get better in. It could be a good end for me but it's not my final game", "label": "gptneo"}

A man, also thought to be aged between 18 and 22, is still on the run.\n\nA 14-year-old boy is also in hospital with head injuries. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening after he was badly shaken.\n\nA young girl with a possible broken leg was left in hospital last night following the attack on her parents.\n\nHer 13-year-old brother, a pupil at another school nearby, sustained long-term facial injuries.\n\nAnd a young boy, who attends the same school, has severe head and facial injuries. He was taken to hospital last night following the attack in which he was beaten and kicked repeatedly.\n\nThe father of the 14-year-old boy, who was attacked, said: “My boy just saw his father get beaten by three men, my son’s head was cracked open and he had a black eye.\n\n“I don’t know how anyone can go to sleep knowing what is coming around the corner.\n\nA 14-year-old girl is still in hospital after an apparently random attack on her father and three brothers in their home at Newton Abbot.\n\nThe family had been out celebrating a birthday when she was attacked and kicked while being held down on the lounge.\n\nThe father, in his forties, is believed to have been walking through the streets when he was attacked and beaten with such ferocity that he spent around eight hours in hospital last night.\n\nThe incident happened near the police station in Newton Abbot. It follows a murder last week on the New River, where the suspect’s brother has been charged with murdering another man.\n\nAnd it comes five days after a young boy was viciously attacked while in his mother’s care.\n\nA spate of events have left the town in shock across the country, according to the Sussex Echo.\n\nThe attack on the family happened at 8.30pm on Thursday, after they had returned home at around 4pm from a family birthday party at nearby Trelowarren Park, near Newhaven.\n\nPolice have not ruled out the possibility of a link with the New River killing.\n\nThe couple are being treated at a ‘secure hospital’ because they are in a state of shock.\n\nA neighbour said of the children: “It’s terrible, every day they look like it’s their last day on this earth.\n\n“It’s a horror show across Sussex.\n\n“I can’t fathom why anyone would want to do that. Why would anyone want to take over a town, just cause they were bored and wanted something to happen. The whole town is in shock, people are in disbelief.”\n\nMeanwhile, police were on scene at Victoria Road, where a young girl has been taken to hospital after being brutally assaulted.\n\nThe girl, who was badly injured, suffered injuries to her head and was left to bleed heavily from a head wound.\n\nShe is now on life-support thanks to treatment with an intravenous drip.\n\nMeanwhile, one man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of another man in Newland in south-east Essex.\n\nThe man, 19, was arrested after a post mortem examination found he had suffocated his colleague who was found with knife wounds including to the head.

{"text": "the obstruction of the superior vena cava ( svc ) ). For this reason some of the vessels used in their assessment are technically unsuitable for this purpose. However, some studies are available which show the reliability of non-invasive methods in assessing the svc and have used them to evaluate the patency of the svc. The aorta ( svc ), is relatively easily assessed by several methods. However, an accurate evaluation of the svc is difficult as it is often surrounded by pulsating and torsioned vessels. Several methods have been evaluated in the assessment of this vessel. Some of methods are based on pulsating waves as they allow to perform aorto-aortic retrograde pressure measurement while others use Doppler aorto-venous flow measurements. These last methods have a high interest for the clinician to use them as an alternative procedure to conventional invasive angiography. Some studies are also available to assess coronary vessels such as the origin of the left coronary artery (s.c. left main stem). However, some of these methods are very difficult to perform with current techniques. The most reliable way to evaluate the svc for an accurate and reliable evaluation of patency is by means of angiography when a contrast medium is injected into the svc before angiographic examination. Furthermore, the study of svc occlusion by means of angiography has been very much developed in recent years and has been proved to be highly accurate.\n\nThis article aims to review the different non-invasive approaches for the evaluation of the svc, summarizing their respective strengths and limitations, in order to help clinicians to make better decisions in the evaluation of these patients. The main question that clinicians must address when considering diagnostic procedures for evaluating congenital heart defects with aorto-coronary vascular malformations are: which non-invasive procedure is the best one to use? A thorough examination of the available methods, their limitations, and their usefulness in the evaluation of the aorta and the svc is necessary to answer this question.\n\nThe current paper focuses on non-invasive assessment of the inferior vena cava (s.c. superior vena cava, svc) with special emphasis on its pathophysiology, the clinical context and different non-invasive diagnostic methods used to assess its patency. A thorough analysis of the various methods used to assess the occlusion of the svc and the evaluation of its patency have been performed using a systematic review methodology.\n\nDifferent studies have been reported in the literature on the patency of the inferior vena cava (s.c. superior vena cava, svc) in different heart defects under the assumption that the patency of inferior vena cava (s.c. superior vena cava, svc) affects the cardiac performance. Non-invasive radiological methods have become the mainstay of evaluation of the extent and severity of aortic diseases, being frequently used in aortic surgery. On the contrary, less attention has been given to the evaluation of the svc and its patency.\n\nIn the current study, we review different non-invasive techniques employed to assess the svc and its patency. We have applied a systematic review approach to all available literature in order to summarize different methods used to assess the patency of the svc, both in children and adults and to evaluate their applicability in evaluation of patients with congenital heart defects with aorto-coronary malformations. Based on this systematic review, a meta-analysis was performed of the literature available regarding assessment of the svc using non-invasive diagnostic procedures in patients with cardiovascular defects.\n\nThe most reliable way to assess patency of aortic or superior vena cava, though, remains aortography, since the vascular supply to those vessels arises from two or three pulmonary arteries. The aortography is a widely used method in many patients with congenital heart defects for evaluation of aortic disease and its abnormalities. Although its use and applicability are based on clinical experience and well-designed studies with prospective design, few studies have assessed the effectiveness of aortography in cases of congenital heart defects with aorto-coronary malformations.\n\nThe aortocoronoar vein connection (avc) is the normal anastomosis of the innominate artery ( sa ) with the inferior vena cava ( svc ) and the left common cardinal artery ( sa ) with the subclavian artery ( svc ). In the majority of patients, the avc is usually not an obstacle to the flow of blood between left and right vascular systems, and is often not an impediment to the outflow of blood from the right side of heart. The avc does not appear to cause any problem during exercise, hemodynamic changes or in patients with normal cardiac rhythm. However, some of the", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "In 2014, economists with the Standard & Poor's rating agency said that one in ten American children were overweight, nearly one in five had diabetes, and one in eight were on medication for high blood pressure.\n\nChildren, particularly boys, are often the most active consumers of sports in our society. That is important, because they play at more competitive levels than other adolescents. But we also need their ability to play sports without fear of injury, because, in many instances, their behavior and personality can help us understand a lot about their future, and how they can change their behavior to be better for themselves and for others, as well as for their communities. There seems to be a greater emphasis on competitive sports among young boys than young girls, which is true in many sports (and in academic and performance excellence too). Even in non-competitive sports such as running, swimming, biking and martial arts, participation is often more strongly associated with boys. The reason is not clear, although certainly there is competition in every life context.\n\nWhile I have been fortunate to be around sports throughout my career for much of my life, and have seen more males enter my discipline of sport psychology, my experience has mostly been during their adolescent years. During these years, most of the issues I hear most about are related to the adolescent phase of boys who decide to be involved in sports, rather than in their later years on, or as adults with sports.\n\nIn a report by the New Zealand Ministry of Health, conducted among youth in the country in 2006, more than half of all boys were obese, and more than 40 percent of boys had an overabundance of body fat, and were more than two years younger than their peers. Those who were obese were more likely to have more negative attitudes towards life and other people, with more suicidal thoughts and more social dissatisfaction, were often unhappy with school grades, and were more likely to have ADHD and other psychiatric disorders. Not surprisingly, those who were less physically active and had a lower fitness level were also more likely to be obese.\n\nIt took only twenty-five short minutes for a group of twenty boys to walk a total of approximately 3.5 miles, covering a distance of over one hundred yards. This short and pleasant walk was done in twenty-four to twenty-eight degree heat, with the boys all wearing street clothes. It could have been the walk from school to the field to practice, or from the athletic field to the school track, or from their own home to a sporting event. Whatever the reason, the journey involved walking on different streets as they walked on the city's busiest downtown, along busy country roads, and at the bottom of the steep hills in the country in a park.\n\nIn some cultures and societies, there is also a more relaxed attitude toward and encouragement of boys, in addition to a positive relationship with sport. It will be recalled that when I joined my undergraduate alma mater fifteen years ago, it was a rather mixed environment, and I could see the difference with more gender equality and openness. But now, twenty years later, with the attitudes we live with, the school is divided into gender-segregated classrooms. It is a place where many of the most aggressive athletes are on the track, and I have seen many more aggressive behaviors and attitudes there, many more challenges to other students' mental and physical health, and at much higher levels than before.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that gender equality has an important impact on the relationship and attitude of male and female young people to sport, I see a significant role for family and neighborhood play in how boys relate to sport. It certainly is true that in most families, sport and physical activity begin early on, and then many boys and girls enter the sports in which they become competitive and enjoy; but there is also a difference, in that in almost every young family, sport and physical activity go in different directions.\n\nIn fact, I have worked with and with teenage boys to establish a very positive relationship with sports in the context of their family and their neighborhood school, as I have done and as other researchers have done. There are a variety of different ways of approaching this approach. There is some research and experience that we have learned from studying adolescent girls, for example, who enter an sport competitively in the first phase of adolescence, with competitive and personal goals. Some other girls also start in this competitive phase of adolescence, but then choose to pursue other areas of interest, and even to pursue an interest in the more recreational realm, including sports, rather than being drawn in this competitive direction all the way to the end of adolescence. In these cases, it can be helpful to find a different group to work with when one is exploring a more competitive role.\n\nMost boys do not enter the competitive sport arena until they are in middle or high school years. While this seems to be true in many cases, as well as in the most aggressive, the boys who enter the sport arena in my", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "From the late 1340s onwards, people in the countryside suffered greatly from the plague: they found it more and more of a challenge to hunt, to harvest crops, even to catch their own lambs. As a result, many farmers moved to the plains between the river and the Rhine.\n\nThe most important town between Aachen and Basel, in the former kingdom of the Dukes of Württemberg, was Sigmaringen, which became a major producer of arms, which was often exported to Austria, the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. When the Württembergs ruled Sigmaringen and Baden as a separate entity from other parts of Thuringia for more than 350 years, the city is known by many names and in very different ways: Rheinsberg (Red Hill), Krumau (Roman city), Aachen, Durlach, Sigmaringen, Freiburg, or Baden.\nSigmaringen was a very important cultural meeting place at the time, with writers, artisans, architects and musicians regularly visiting with their families and colleagues. With the rise of Romanticism and the beginnings of German nationalism, Sigmaringen was for many years a home for radicals and revolutionists. The town quickly developed as one of the most important of the northern regions, and also as one of the leading centres of the German Protestant movement, which by that time dominated all of German Protestantism.\n\nThe town also saw two major wars between different Protestant groups: the war between the Reformed Church and the Lutheran Church, and two wars between the Catholics and the Protestant Germans (German Revolution). The Reformation had been brought to France but was not a success, and the German Protestants had to find a new homeland in Sigmaringen, as well as in other German towns like Plettenberg or Lübeck.\n\nThe city was also known for trade and its growing export market, including such things as beer. However, Sigmaringen quickly developed into a cultural centre which soon attracted artists as well as artists' families to settle in the town. Not least important, Sigmaringen had a substantial art museum with a fine collection of Renaissance and Baroque painting, with many of the works having been painted in Paris and Italy.\n\nAnother highlight of Sigmaringen's cultural life came with the performance of Bach's German oratorio. Sigmaringen, as the capital of Sigmaringen county, was part of the famous Bach Festival in Leipzig from 1866 until the Second World War. The musical world of Sigmaringen was also important for other composers from the same period as Bach, like Richard Wagner to the north, and Paul Hindemith to the south (see musical movement), but not least for Franz Schubert, whose Schubert song cycle was composed in Sigmaringen.\n\nDuring the War of the Fourth Coalition and again during the Second World War, for the most part Sigmaringen was not damaged; unlike many German towns, it did not suffer much from bombardment and bombing from the air. Sigmaringen's centre of social and cultural life did not suffer too much, as German intellectuals and artists were able to stay after the war, like Hans Geiringer did in the 1920s.\n\nFamous individuals of that time could include several statesmen: the German statesman and president Konrad Adenauer (1921–73), the poet Richard Duttenhofer (1924–65), and the philosopher Georg Gadamer (1870–62) – Georges Hèze and Max Horkheimer are also said to have visited Sigmaringen from 1930 to 1932 while being in exile in America with Adorno. Max Horkheimer had become famous as a young philosopher for his book, The Dialectic of Enlightenment, written in reaction against the totalitarian ideas of Adorno and Habermas.\n\nFamous musicians of the time included Hermann Scherchen and Karl Reinecke, and the composers Arnold Schoenberg, Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann, who came across from Germany. Johann Sebastian Bach performed his famous cantata, Das Haus Württembergischen Staatsbürgerschaft, in Sigmaringen at the time of the Second World War. In 1943, Bach would spend six weeks composing his Missahistoricae cantatas in a church at Erfurt.\n\nThe building of the Sigmaringen–Bad Tölz railway line and the opening of the Sigmaringen–Bad Tölz–Basel railway line in 1908 were a major economic event. This marked the beginning of a new phase in the history of Sigmaringen. At the same time, the construction of St Michael's Church, Sigmaringen's most important religious building, was taking place.

Board members have the power to “take any action necessary for the proper government of the University of Chicago,”[5] including the power to withhold the funds of the University of Chicago to be used in the University of Chicago’s official functions.[6]\n\nOn December 10, 2014, the University of Chicago Board of Trustees voted to expel the University of Chicago from its Council for the Advancement of Education—one of its core values as a university is the promotion of education.[7] The reason given was the University of Chicago’s continued unwillingness to honor obligations owed to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the University’s suspension came in response to the University allegedly using Title IX to threaten to expel a student from the university over an email which contained sexually explicit remarks.[8]\n\nA group called “No Higher” has also been active in organizing protests against the University over these matters.[9]\n\nOn December 10, 2014, shortly after the University of Chicago Board of Trustees gave public notice that the University had suspended its membership in the Council,[10] and after students received more information regarding potential actions the University was about to take, the Committee on University Policy and Procedure held a discussion regarding the potential expulsion of the University of Chicago, in the wake of recent developments in the case involving the University’s suspension of membership in the Council in response to a Title IX complaint.[11]\n\nAt that meeting, the committee held what was called “Status-of-Action Confab-2: Threats and Threats of Violence Against University of Chicago Students and Faculty”.[12] The status-of-action confab followed a number of actions the University had taken leading up to the December 10, 2014 meeting.\n\nOn November 22, 2014 the University issued its report on an investigation which the Committee had instituted into “university student conduct” in the wake of an incident involving three University of Chicago students (who were later indicted, together with another University of Chicago student).[13]\n\nIn that report, the University concluded that the University had engaged in “university student conduct violations in four different cases” and that the University “has demonstrated a pattern of escalating actions against our students when there has been an absence of University action.”[14]\n\nIt also concluded that the University needs to “conduct meaningful internal university dialogue” to “ensure that we adhere to our values and our students.”[15]\n\nAfter some of the U.S. Department of Education’s offices had contacted the University of Chicago regarding Title IX concerns, the University of Chicago issued a letter to all faculty members and staff announcing that the University had “decided to suspend the University’s membership in the Committee”.[16]\n\nThat letter followed a meeting between a number of members of the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, including its Assistant General Counsel, the Director of the Office of Civil Rights, the U.S. Department of Education’s Assistant General Counsel, and University of Chicago law professors.[17] All four present were non-University members of the U.S. Department of Education’s OCR committee.\n\nAt the meeting held on December 10, 2014, the Committee decided that the University had suspended its membership in the Council for the Advancement of Education.

{"text": "background : degenerative flat back ( dfb ) is characterized as flat-back if its front and rear surfaces form a single spherical shape with minimal curvature and with a maximum radius. This shape has a flat rear, a rounded front and an elliptic side view (Fig. 1.3).\n\n FIGURE 1.3 Flat-back vehicle silhouette.\n\nThe term \"flat back\" emphasizes the shape of the vehicle silhouette above the steering wheel (Fig. 1.4). It is usually produced by a special flat-back design (a.k.a. the \"V-pillar\" rear view mirror) to reduce interference with headlamps, see Fig. 1.4(f′). This type of flat-back silhouette is considered the \"perfect\" vehicle silhouette and its shape is well defined and well characterized, as shown in Fig. 1.3.\n\n FIGURE 1.4 Flat-back vehicle silhouettes.\n\n##  1.2.  The Dynamic Profile\n\nThe vehicle silhouette is the shape determined by and depends on the driver's movements. This shape is determined by a combination of the driver's vision, road, traffic and ambient conditions. The first two conditions affect the headlamp silhouette shape, while the latter two determine the vehicle silhouette shape.\n\nGiven the vehicle speed and the driver's and passengers' height, the vehicle rear profile will change as the headlamp profile changes, and vice versa. Both the driver's and passengers' body proportions are affected by headlamp position.\n\nThe driver's proportions are determined mostly by vision, as shown in Fig. 1.5: with front-on or rear-on headlamp position, the upper arm (upper arm height) and nose extension (nose height) will be greater compared to the frontal area; if the headlamp is inclined towards the rider (the \"headlamp position is rear-on\") and the speed increases, headlamp position will change and rider proportions will change. The body proportions at normal headlamp position (front-on) are the same for front-on and rear-on headlamp position, although the rearward position is used for rear-on headlamp position.\n\n FIGURE 1.5 Vehicle rear profiles.\n\nThe driver's vision also determines the vehicle rear width, as shown in Fig. 1.6. With increasing passenger height, the driver's view will extend behind the front end of the vehicle and the vehicle width will increase, as shown in Fig. 1.7.\n\n FIGURE 1.6 Driver's view for flat and inclined vehicle rear profile.\n\nThe driver's vision also determines the vehicle width for different front-inclination angles, as shown in Fig. 1.8: with increasing passenger height, the front end of vehicle extends behind the headlamp to become wider and the vehicle width increases, as shown in Fig. 1.9.\n\n##  1.3.  Front End of Vehicle (Rear profile)\n\nThe front end of the vehicle profile has its center of gravity at the front fender tip in the front fender opening region of the vehicle wheel. The headlamp protrudes slightly beyond the front fender opening in the front fender opening region of the vehicle wheel, as seen in Fig. 1.10(a). Headlamp height also determines the front fender opening in front-on headlamp position and this height is about one-third smaller than the headlamp base width. The front fender opening is in the front fender region (the region between the front fender and the vehicle wheel side flange) and is typically three inches wide. The front fender opening is not symmetrical to the vehicle wheel center line. The front fender is not round due to the vehicle wheel centerline having small radius of curvature.\n\n FIGURE 1.6 Driver's view (normal position) for various front-inclination angles.\n\nFront-inclination angle to the horizontal determines the side profile of the vehicle silhouette. With increasing front-inclination angle, the vehicle silhouette becomes wider at the headlamp center due to headlamp protrusion out of the front fender, as shown in Fig. 1.14(a) and Fig. 1.12(a). Because the headlamp protrusion is about one-third smaller than the headlamp tip width, the headlamp tip width increases compared to the vehicle width and the vehicle side profile becomes wider at the headlamp center, as shown in Fig. 1.15. The side profile of the vehicle silhouette remains symmetrical with respect to the front-inclination angles, but the side radius of curvature is reduced and the vehicle silhouette becomes relatively wider at the headlamp center.\n\n FIGURE 1.7 Driver's view for various vehicle widths.\n\nThe vehicle front profile has a low center of gravity.

{"text": "the loss of a coding nucleobase from   the    Phe codon is    determined.        \n\nS. K. Doon, Biochemistry, 627 (1991).\n\n2.5.8 Amino Acid Uptake Mechanisms\n\nAmino acids are involved in cell and organ growth and in metabolic pathways. Consequently, they can be taken up by mechanisms which have evolved over many millions of years of evolution (see Chapters 3 and 11 in this volume, and Chapters 9,, and ). Some proteins such as the transferases take up a wide range of amino acids from many different metabolic pathways [see references (16) and (17) in Chapter 3. For example, the human transferase system can take up the amino acids lysine, serine, tyrosine, methionine, threonine and valine from amino acid metabolism. The human transferase system does so by means of a large number of different transferases specific for that particular amino acid: that is, the human system can take up as many as 19 different amino acids from several metabolic pathways.\n\nThe mechanism of uptake at the level of the metabolic pathway is quite complex. At the metabolic pathway level, there are numerous different carrier/substrate binding proteins which bind to the various substrates (e.g. amino acids) for a limited period of time (e.g. hours) during which the substrate is transported to the tissue from which the substrate is taken up.\n\nIn mammalian organs, these carrier/substrate binding proteins have evolved into specific cell surface receptors which are specific for particular organ and cell types as described previously[]. Substrates are taken up into the cell through the active process of receptor binding; the substrates are then passed to other binding proteins, which release the substrates (for example, amino acids) which are then taken up by the other carrier/substrate binding proteins, and so on. The mechanism of transmembrane transporter operation in many cells is illustrated in Fig. 3.6 in this volume.\n\nS. K. Doon, Biochemistry, 627 (1991).\n\n2.5.9 Protein Structure and Function\n\nEach amino acid has a chemical formula (the chemical structure) comprising one chiral form with one of the two forms shown in Table A-1 in the appendix of Chapter 3. The chemical formula for L-leucine is C14H23N3O2 and the chemical formula for D-leucine is C14H23N3O2. A chemical form of most amino acids has some structural characteristics and the amino acid structure contains certain functional properties such as protein folding and three dimensional structure properties in particular. The chemical structure of leucine and other amino acids involves the presence of a pair of stereocentres. The chiral form of leucine is called the L-form and the other chiral form, the D-form; and the two enantiomers (enantiomers are considered to be mirror images) have opposite chiral forms (e.g. D-leucine cannot be considered an enantiomeric mirror image but is considered as the same diastereomer as L-leucine but with an opposite chirality). The mirror image relationship for amino acids has been shown to be the molecular basis of molecular symmetry and spatial organization.\n\nS. K. Doon, Biochemistry, 618 (1991).\n\n2.5.10 Amino Acid Metabolism\n\nThe protein sequences within the various proteins that are involved in amino acid metabolism have been studied using computer and biochemical methods (see below). A sequence of the amino-acid-containing sequences from several metabolic pathways for a number of different genes is shown in the appendix of Chapter 3 and a phylogenetic tree (also called a phylogenetic dendrogram) is described below as being an example of genetic relationships in DNA (a dendogram).\n\nFIGURE 2.2: Mechanism of protein degradation and protein recycling\n\nTwo primary degradation pathways are known for protein breakdown. First, during normal metabolism, amino acids are used for protein production and as metabolic building blocks for non-protein cellular components [see the sections below 2.4.2 and 2.4.4 in Chapter 2; and references (13), (14) and (15) in Chapter 2]. Second (Fig. 2.2), the protein chains that are formed during each amino acid metabolism are broken down and then used for new production. Second, there is a third mechanism which is responsible for amino acid degradation, in which an amino acid is converted first to its corresponding keto-acid and then further oxidation to the corresponding carboxy-acid. The oxidation of the amino acid to the corresponding carboxy-acid is a part of a mechanism to recycle the amino acids.\n\nS. K. Doon, Biochemistry", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "I saw this movie when I was about 12 when I was sick with a cold and sitting at home. I had an idea about the movie that I thought was interesting so I decided to watch it that night to see if I liked it. Once I saw it I liked it even more and now I couldn’t stop thinking about it ever since. The main thing I like about the movie is that even though the main character is a girl, the movie deals with the topic of prejudice a lot which gets us deep into the issue of racism and how it affects people. We finally get a little glimpse on how racism is and why it exists.\n\nThe movie follows a girl named Anzalel, her brother (Benny) and her cousin (Misha) who are always worried about her. Anzalel is a white-skinned child who lives with her Indian parents. She’s always teased about looking just like the white girl. She’s always worried about her weight and being picked on her by the boys. She tries to be nice and act as a good friend for the white girls while her cousins try to tease her and try to get more attention than her. On top of that, she has a crush on a boy who plays football with boys. She also tries to hang out with her neighbor (Ann Marie) but he’s so focused on his football and music that he doesn’t know how to be a friend to anyone. The biggest question people are asking about is, is she even related to the boy she has a crush on? We’ll find out later.\n\nFirst off, the plot is really original and I love that it’s not boring. There are a lot of different plot lines that play a major role in the movie. There is the plot line where they are going to have to pretend to be boyfriend/girlfriend to a girl who likes them. Then there is the plot line with the neighbor. Then there’s even a lot of weird stuff that the siblings just end up falling through and getting lost in. They make it complicated but it’s all made to be endearing at the same time. The film has a lot of humor and it’s very endearing.\n\nThis is one of the most interesting films to come out in quite some time. The actors are super cute. Both of the parents are excellent and I love that the parents try to make their child look better than the child they created. I thought Misha’s parents looked really young, like kids that are in elementary school, so it was nice and relatable to me. I was kind of disappointed by the black female character because I didn’t think she was black enough. There’s no racial tension in the movie because it does not really deal with racism but more about the prejudices and how they are passed onto girls. The film deals with a lot of different topics and the characters deal with everything. There are also a lot who get lost in it, but they all make up for it.\n\nThere was a really funny scene that came with the main protagonist that I definitely had to talk about. It’s basically like a very long monologue where she talks about how much she loves this character on her cousin’s side. It’s also about how she looks at this other person and she thinks they are her boyfriend/girlfriend. I think it’s really funny because on some level you can interpret the relationship and her crush on this character. On another level, I don’t think her character is even in the movie because it doesn’t really feel like there’s her character that I’m assuming it’s for a while.\n\nIt has a very different story than similar films, it’s very original. There are a lot of different themes and a lot of characters, and it ends up being really interesting and funny. Even though this is not the most original movie, I think I still liked it, even though it’s not really in my usual genre. I just love the art of movies and it’s really nice to see a movie this unique. I don’t usually buy movies that I don’t know in my genre but this one really grabbed my attention. I would recommend this movie to anyone.\n\nI am on a search, I believe it’s called. It’s called finding a friend, finding a best friend and then finding what it looks like like for our friendship to continue past that point. I have never been in a friendship group in my life. I have only had really great friends and have made close friendships with people, but I never really felt in a group. I was always lonely in groups so I never really knew it until the film, the film, in my opinion, just about found a friend. I didn’t", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "It was shown by Ladner that if P ≠ NP then the \"difficulty\" of the NP problem is strictly inferior to the difficulty of a given NP problem. And if P = NP then such problems are \"equivalent\" in that it is impossible to find two problems that are \"equivalent\" in terms of their NP-difficulty. In effect, problems in NP are too hard for anyone to solve.\n\nIn this case we could prove the existence of NP problems that are \"hard\" in the sense that there is no algorithm that can solve them in exponential time, or that can solve them in polynomial time with a bound that will be tight when the algorithm starts with an input which is a valid instance of an NP problem (in the case where P ≠ NP the \"bound\" has to be defined in terms of a lower bound, as in the \"time-out\" result of the Toda argument).\n\nThe fact that any problem can be expressed as a subset of a fixed boolean circuit is known as the Dickson's Lemma, which is the basis for the proof that any non-trivial problem can be defined as a subset of a fixed Boolean circuit.\n\nIt was further studied by Zuse, who proved that every non-trivial decision problem can be reduced in polynomial size to some problems in the complement language of a certain fixed language, the so-called language of the complement of the problem. He called such languages \"complete\" languages, because the languages of any such problem form a complete lattice, and any non-trivial decision problem is the intersection of complete languages. He also proved that the complexity of any problem can be expressed as the language intersection of certain complete languages. This problem was later generalized by Garey and Johnson to express the complexity of any problem as the intersection of arbitrary finite sets of complete languages, and was further generalized by Cook to express the complexity of any problem as an intersection of complements of arbitrary functions (a.k.a. the NP-completeness of the problem).\n\nIn any Boolean circuit-based complexity class, the complexity of a problem is the size of the smallest Boolean function of that problem that would be able to do the computation. In order to decide whether or not a decision problem is in P, D, or NP, that is, whether the problem is polynomial-time solvable, deterministic-time solvable and quantum-time solvable respectively, we would like this function to be \"small\" in the first two cases, and \"large\" in the third case.\n\nIn this case, if P = NP or NPT, one may be able to convert the decision problem into a much easier problem, and use efficient algorithms for the easier problem to solve the original problem. However, that is not what \"NP hardness\" meant in NP-completeness theorems. These theorems are named after the (complement of the) language of \"NP hard\" (that is, complements of NPE and NP).\n\nIn particular, the languages of problems P = NP and NPT are not complete.\n\nNP-complete problems are very close to being trivial. For example, if P≠NP or NPT, then any given problem that is in neither P nor NP is contained within the complement of the language of problems P = NP and NPT. This is shown by showing that the P = NP problem for P ≠ NP is also contained within the complement of NP-complete languages. This gives an efficient way to solve NP-complete problems, even if the original problem was hard. The proof uses the famous Toda theorem. This theorem can be considered a generalization of Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, and is a special case of Valiant's theorem in logic. In this case, Valiant proved that if P = NP then the NP-hard problem cannot be written as P + NPHW. In other words, it cannot be recursively encoded within the logic L of the language of (complement of the) language of NP-hard problems. Since NP and NPHW are not \"equivalent\" languages, this implies that NP-hard problems in NP-complete languages cannot be \"encoded\" with the logic P ≠ NP and NPHW. This is the reason why \"NP hardness\" cannot be reduced from \"P to NP\" and \"NPT hardness\" cannot be reduced from \"NPHW to NP,\" like we saw above. Similarly, in the case of NPT-hard problems we cannot reduce \"NP to NP\" and \"NC to NP\" and \"P to NP,\" because of Valiant's theorem.\n\nIf P = NP or NPT then these languages can actually be efficiently decidable: every problem of this language that is not in P, NP or NPHW is equivalent as the problem to a problem in the languages NPHW or N", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "we investigate the equal - mass 3-body system in general and in particular the motion of the two colliding planets. This is done for two different values of the planet-planet tidal strength, $Q_d$ = 1 and $Q_d$ = 1/3, and for different values of the impact parameter. These values of the impact parameters and the tidal strength are realistic for the planets of our solar system. For our study we have used the planet mass ratio equal to one, which is the best one for the 3-body problem. We have investigated numerically also the case of equal masses planets. The values of the constants entering $Q_s$ are chosen to be the same for all systems of planets.\n\nThe initial positions of the bodies are chosen randomly. The initial positions of the planets are given by the equation $z_j(s) = z_s\\omega(s)$, where $j=1,\\ldots,12$ is the initial planet number, $s$ is the distance along the orbit between two bodies, $\\omega(s)$ is a random distribution with mean zero and standard deviation $\\sigma = \n0.1 $, and $z_s$ is a random number between $-1$ and +1, chosen uniformly. Figure \\[f-1\\] shows the initial configurations for three different mean values for $\\omega(s)$: one zero and two equal mean values with standard deviations 1 and 2. As an example, Figure \\[f-2\\] shows the initial configuration for the case $\\omega(s)\n= \\left\\{ \n\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 & s\\; \\; \\mbox{is smaller than 50 km}, \\\\\n0.5 & s\\; \\; \\mbox{is equal 30 to 50 km},\n\\label{mixed}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n$ where $s$ is the distance.\n\nFor small separation, the collision is not a hard one. The velocity vectors at the collision point are in general directed along the straight line between the centers of masses of the colliding bodies before the collision. However, when the separation reaches a value of some few $s_H$, this alignment is broken.\n\nAs a result of the collision, the bodies begin to fall towards each other. Figure \\[f-coll\\] shows the time evolution of the impact parameter for the collision of equal mass, $Q_d$=1/3, planets. The other planet-planet parameter which is used is, for simplicity, still the $Q_s$ parameter.\n\nAlthough the case considered in the simulation is an idealized one, and the number of planets in the system may be as small as three, or as large as 15 depending on their masses and other physical factors the time scales considered in the simulations are large enough to find results in agreement with our general theory. Some of the initial configurations (not shown here) have been chosen to demonstrate various possible situations. It is clear that the collisions are not perfectly elastic, as can be seen from the initial velocities of the bodies. As the velocities increase from zero to some finite value and the distance between the bodies increases or decreases, then the velocities decrease and their kinetic energy and the total energy transferred are greater, i.e. more complex physical effects such as damping and dissipation of energy are expected.\n\nThe simulation results for the collision of equal-mass asteroids are shown in Figure \\[f-coll\\] (thin lines). For systems with three or five planets in our solar system, the probability of a planet-planet collision with no other planet being present in the system is $\\sim$1%. In the same figure lines with thicker lines show for systems containing the Jupiter-Neptune system. In that case $P$ is increased to $\\sim$2%.\n\nWe see that the asteroid-planet collisions have the largest effect on planetary systems containing more than one planet. However, this increase in the collision probability is moderate and the effect of the collisions are not dramatic in other systems such as Jupiter-Neptune.\n\nWe have performed simulations using $Q_s$ = 1, and $Q_s$ = 1/3, but our conclusions do not depend on them, just as they do not depend either on using $Q_s$ = 3 or $Q_s$ = 5.\n\nWhen the distance between bodies $s\\sim s_H$ a transition occurs between the free fall and the hard body regime. The gravitational forces between the bodies and their internal forces are no longer negligible so that energy is transferred between the bodies. This implies that the energy may be dissipated and a strong radiation of gravitational waves may form. If this happened on the collision time scale, the body would survive", "label": "gptneo"}

These include measurements of the Einstein radius, axis ratio or the lensed source, and the position angle at the minimum-resolving power of $0{\\farcs}1$. However, as can be seen in Fig. \\[fig:photometry\\], the source is extended along the line of sight at least out to the Einstein length, which constrains measurements of the source position, and any associated light deflection due to a caustic produced by the bright arc. The  data used in this work are from observations as part of the “Sternberg Survey Optical Lensing Program”, taken between the dates of July 17th 2001, and August 15th 2002 under the conditions described in @2006AJ....132.1256L. This set of four data points were supplemented with three sets taken in 2002 for and, giving a total of nine data points. Two of these were taken under a cloud-based atmosphere, with the other seven taken on a clear night with the telescopes equipped with a filter. These data points were reduced in a similar manner to those described in. The uncertainties on the astrometric positions were calculated by performing a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm on the positions for each data point and using the uncertainty determined for each data point at that time as the error on the parameters in the subsequent fit. This process is repeated with each data point. The resulting uncertainties are conservative errors in the astrometric positions, and do not take into account systematic errors within the data, which we do not include in our analysis.\n\nReduced Astrometry {#section:analysis_obs_reduced_astrometry}\n-----------------\n\n###  {#section", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "objectivethe aim if the study was to investigate whether children of older parents learn to make effective use of the available cognitive resources better than children of younger parents. If so, it may make it advisable to provide a formal educational or cognitive training programme for these children, which might be effective in improving their literacy and cognitive skills. The present study found a significant main effect of parental age on children's ability to decode words (d = 1.29). Children of 16-year-olds made more use of the available cognitive resources than children of 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds. There was no significant main effect of any of the family status variables considered (single, joint, or with grandparents) and none found in a previous study on this question (Szecsko and Kooi [@CR27]).\n\nThe present result of main effects of parental age and family status is surprising. Two explanations are possible: First is the possibility of chance finding as a result of an unreliable test and, second is the possibility of the presence of differential effects according to the children's age or the family status of their parents, respectively (see also Roff, [@CR26]). Children of older parents or those who are living with grandparents have been shown to have reduced reading achievement, as compared to children with younger parents (Szecsko and Kooi [@CR28]; van den Boogerd, Roelofsen, and Trompenaars, [@CR31]; van den Boogerd et al., [@CR32]; De Dreu et al., [@CR8]). It has been speculated that such children may have less support from family members, may have little influence in household tasks and may struggle more to express themselves independently, and consequently, may encounter more difficulties using the cognitive resources in reading and writing tasks (Szecsko and Kooi [@CR27]; van den Boogerd, Roelofsen, and Trompenaars, [@CR31]; van den Boogerd et al., [@CR32]). The present study did not find any significant difference of the results between children of parents 16 and those of parents 9. However, as we are the first to study the influence of parents' family status on the reading skills of their children, it is still to be shown whether the influence might be different in children living with grandparents compared with parents. The fact that the results of this study did not reveal that the quality of parents' support affects children's reading performance can be explained by the fact that we did not control for social environment and the quality of the parents' social support as such were not measured in this study. Additionally, the use of standardized scales to assess reading, oral reading, decoding and reading skills may contribute to more accurate assessment of reading skill. For all that, it also remains unclear whether such a relationship between children's socioeconomic status and reading ability has been found, as previous studies did not control for children's socioeconomic status while testing for children's reading ability (van den Boogerd et al., [@CR32]; Eder et al., [@CR10]; Szecsko et al., [@CR29]). Our study found that children of 16-year-olds and older had a smaller decoding ability than children of younger parents, whereas other studies have found no difference in reading skills (van den Boogerd et al., [@CR31]; De Dreu et al., [@CR8]).\n\nThe main aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between children's socioeconomic status and their reading skills. The previous study by Szecsko and Kooi [@CR27] showed that single or joint parents made more use of the cognitive resources than married parents and that grandparents were more efficient in providing children with support than other family members. We expected that these factors would influence the relationship between maternal mental health and children's reading skills. We are, thus, also interested in whether the presence of a parent with a college/university education affects the relationship between maternal mental health and children's reading skills (Hobday, [@CR14]).\n\nThe present study provided new information on the relationship between family support, parental age, maternal mental health and children's reading skill.\n\nIn relation to family support, the current investigation found that children of parents 9 or older were more productive in using the available cognitive resources than children of parents in the lower age group (9 vs. 11; 9 vs. 16; 11 vs. 16). The family status variable showed no effect on children's decoding skills. The absence of any significant influence of socioeconomic status on the relationship between mental health in mothers and children's decoding skills highlights that the relationship between parental education and child education is not related to their maternal employment status. The result is in accordance with Hobday ([@CR14]), who found no difference in children's academic achievement as related to either fathers' university/diploma or non-", "label": "gptneo"}

We therefore stress that our modelling framework offers a novel approach to addressing the complexity of the dynamics of HIV treatment in real-life. It could help us to understand the complex interactions between other important factors that influence cure such as the number of sexual partners and viral load (or time since viral suppression), the effects of such factors on the HIV viral load, and the effects on social network structure \\[[@r30]\\].

In effect, they want to break away and form a new party.\"[16] The following day, the former New York City Council president told his listeners, \"A lot of folks are talking about what Stein said the other day, and why, when Wall Street was up against the wall they took away a lot of their money in a very ugly manner[,]\" and that their party \"is not a party that is in favor of big banks.\" He concluded by saying that \"it's nice to see so many people saying that[.]\"\n\nDespite this, and his claim of opposition to the Occupy Wall Street Movement, the party's New York City chapter has been working to support Occupy Wall Street: in addition to encouraging and giving financial support to Occupy Wall Street and the \"Occupy Wall Street movement,\" the local chapter has been supporting the Democratic National Convention protests.[17]\n\nIn early October, Stein and MoveOn's Andrew Kamin hosted a \"Labor Day Celebration\" in New York in which \"New York labor unions, which have been supportive of the Occupy Wall Street Movement, are the guests of honor. As labor rights groups nationwide have denounced Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's anti-union stance as a move to take jobs away from American workers, Stein and Kamin praised the Occupy Wall Street Movement for creating economic justice.\" The event was attended by approximately 200 labor leaders. A spokesman for the New York City chapter of the Communist Party of the United States and Canada said, \"The celebration was designed to support labor unions, that they had supported the Occupy Wall Street movement and in particular the demonstrations in other cities against Wall Street and the '1%.'\"[19]\n\nStein's position as an independent socialist left an opening for her to form and run in primaries. In October 2011 Stein had endorsed Joe Biden for president and had attended a fundraiser in support of his campaign, donating $200,000 to the New Hero Fund. In November 2012, a new endorsement was announced, and Stein donated an additional $200,000 to Biden.[20] She raised more than the amount that Biden had received in his previous two primary elections (with a minimum contribution of $500) and was reported to have received an infusion of money from wealthy donors and major left-leaning activist organizations.[20]\n\nDuring a campaign debate, Stein said that she would not be involved in third party presidential primaries, such as the Green Party's Jill Stein and the Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson.\n\nIn April 2013, Stein became involved with the People's Republic Party US-Canada and pledged to support candidates from the party.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Jill Stein and the Working Families Party filed a lawsuit against Ohio and the Ohio Democratic Party asking them to overturn a state primary that excluded them. It was argued that because the state party excluded the Working Families Party's candidate for Ohio's 1st congressional district, Keith Rothfus, Stein and other potential candidates won no chance of becoming a party's nominee. The Ohio Supreme Court eventually tossed out the lawsuit on June 27, 2013 finding that the ballot access rules in Ohio were sound, in that they excluded candidates who did not have a chance of winning the nomination and were not in any manner fraudulent.[22][23] Stein and the Working Families Party celebrated the ruling, but the party is now focused on state primaries and not on winning the nomination in the next presidential election.[e]\n\nStein first came to national attention when she founded and launched an organization for those seeking the Democratic ticket for President and which would provide grassroots support for the presidential candidacy being run by then Senator Barack Obama.[24] Although named, the organization was not affiliated with Barack Obama. The organization had not obtained the official registration as a political party. Stein raised more than $10 million for the organization. She then chose to run in what is now Senator Obama's presidential campaign.\n\nBefore the 2008 election, Stein ran as the Democrat in New York State's 27th congressional district, covering the counties of Erie, Seneca, Lackawanna, Sullivan, and Tioga. This district is considered to be an \"open\" seat for Obama, since the Republican line is very strong, as this 27th district is largely in the North Central part of the county, although includes Erie County which voted for Romney by a wide margin. However, Stein faced many challenges in her run, including running against a strong incumbent Republican incumbent, Bruce Poliquin, who had been a member of the U.S. House for 24 years. (Poliquin resigned his candidacy for House Majority Leader because of an unspecified \"conflict of interest\" with the Obama administration.).

When Uber CEO Travis Kalanik took over as CEO in June 2016, it was clear his vision was to scale up and disrupt the car ownership industry.\n\nIn June 2015, he had the idea of building a similar system for ride hailing, allowing people to order a ride through their smartphones. But he had a big problem: he had heard that the cost for self-driving cars could be prohibitive. So he set about finding a way to make it affordable. But before he could find a solution, Uber acquired Jump, the e-hailing platform from former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, during its \"frenemy list\" period.\n\nThe acquisition left Uber facing a dilemma in how to make self-driving cars affordable. It was having trouble making cars, and it was also facing a regulatory nightmare in the U.S.\n\nUber's solution was to use its vast customer-satisfaction data to create an algorithm that would predict what drivers would do in extreme traffic conditions like when stopped for more than five minutes and in snowy weather. This would make a robot-like car driver more appealing in some cities.\n\nBut by the end of 2016, some of the key engineers left. To make the service profitable, the service had been reduced to a three-wheeled, autonomous-driving-through-cities service in certain cities.\n\n\"What happens in a few years is we get rid of the three-wheeled service, and we build a $15-a-minute service,\" Peyser says. The company will also sell its self-driving cars, and it is exploring the option of using the data to develop an AI that can autonomously park autonomous cars. Peyser says Tesla will never do this, because it never built a car that could drive itself at 15 miles per hour. \"We believe that self-driving will soon be cheap enough for all of us.

I think some reporters are like, \"I haven't seen the story we just wrote yet. That's bad!\" Some people say, \"Don't do that. It's bad form.\" I think someone was like, \"Is this story true or fake?\" That's when the real fun begins.\n\nDid you have to go to journalism school?No. I came to journalism by accident. I became a writer for a big-city news site in New York City. The owner was a terrible story editor, and I was like, What am I going to do about this? I had no experience as a journalist. It was like, \"That's a new gig.\" I took it and I fell right into it. It was great because my editors were awesome.

It was like stepping on a cloud.\n\nAfter you returned to The Daily Beast, what was the first job you had when you got back to the newsroom?I worked my way up to a little bit of everything. I started out as a fashion intern, then I was a digital editorial analyst. There's a whole network of things that people think you have to do but you don't.

However, as the potatoes accumulate lead, so too do their children (who also eat them unsupervised). Ingestion of small quantities of potatoes is no cause for alarm; it is, however, a cause for consideration. To obtain a diagnosis of lead poisoning, exposure, if any, should be corroborated by blood analysis of lead. Ingestion of a sufficient quantity will cause a lead toxicosis, such as hyperactivity, learning disabilities, and, in extreme cases, in the form of bone marrow failure. The threshold dose is highly variable from individual to individual, and may be calculated by a margin method or other methods (see Section 10.3). Ingestion of several hundred or 1000 milligrams of lead can cause symptoms and problems, even in the short term. (See also Figure 11.1 on page 130.)\n\nAlthough there is little or no public health benefit from consumption of lead glazed potatoes to prevent lead poisoning and related diseases, the main reason for cooking with lead is to reduce or delay lead contamination (which is unavoidable during cooking and preservation). Cooking of potatoes, in which lead occurs, is not a health risk even after two weeks as long as the glazes are not heated to the point at which they become lead glaze. However, prolonged consumption of a glazed and uncooked potato which still contains lead can cause serious problems.\n\nPotato consumption in China is often considered a health problem, but the evidence indicates little risk of the health consequences of eating lead-contaminated potatoes or of eating a food which has been prepared with lead glaze. In fact, because of a high rate of contamination with lead (as much as 0.1% lead in the fresh-cut potatoes), the health aspects of lead-contaminated food have become of increasing interest to both scientists and the general public. Lead in a potato is generally considered, therefore, as a minor health risk, and the most frequent cause of a hypercholostemic phenotype. However, the hypercholesterolaemic effects of lead are unknown. The American Heart Association (AHA) has described significant associations between occupational exposure to lead and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Lead can increase the risk of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), such as a reduced quality of life, difficulty with sleep and mood disorder. Even though there is a reduced quality of life associated with CVA, this is due to the risk factors of smoking and hypertension. Because of the lower levels of lead (than mercury or cadmium) in the human body, there is a possibility that any risks of lead poisoning are too small to worry about.\n\n### Fungicides/Viricides/Biocides/Antifungals\n\nThe chemicals used to control fungi and moulds can be divided into two major groups: organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals. Organic chemicals include compounds containing metals, such as copper, silver, or zinc (in the form of metal salts). Inorganic chemicals include nitrates, ammonium compounds, and compounds containing boron (B) or phosphorus (P).\n\n**_Chemicals to control fungal growth in wood, paper, glue, and textile fabrics._** Many fungi and moulds (including _Bipolaris_ ) produce enzymes that depolymerize or oxidize cellulose and other polymers (as well as some lignins and proteins) into sugar (sugars are not broken down; see Figure 2.8). They then feed on the sugar, breaking it down into glucose and subsequently releasing the glucose into the media for further fungal growth.\n\n**Figure 2.8** Enzymes can breakdown cellulose, glues, and other plant polymers into sugars.\n\n**Chemicals to control fungal growth in cereals, rice, and other cereal crops.** Fungal infections in cereal crops produce numerous species of _Aspergillus, Aspergillus/Penicillium, Candida, Fusarium_, and _Penicillium_ (all genera) in", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "Note to self. Never ever ever again watch a serious action movie from the front seat of a car on a desolate stretch of highway.\n\nI was recently in my second year of law school, one month into my second year. Since I have had one foot in and one foot out of law school for a decade, I feel like I've seen a lot more of my law school friends go through the same sort of process as I now am. During my first year, I had only three true friends in my class of ~250, and during second year, only one. This year, we count the number of friends in a class of 3,700.\n\nI feel pretty confident that there are more people whose experience I don't know and I don't want to know anything about. But I still wonder if I could have had the first \"real\" friend in my freshman year.\n\n\"First\" I would say, but then I don't know because, once again, I am not there yet. But, to the point. I know. But I don't know because, I don't know. I have to remember to always be first.\n\nI remember so clearly a conversation with my partner one night regarding the subject of the first real relationship. He said \"I'm not sure what he wants to do now that his girlfriend left him\". I don't remember exactly what he said, but my mind immediately went to where I thought he'd be doing.\n\nThen, when I went to law school, I remember sitting in my first course, where I was assigned to take a first course and was supposed to teach it for two hours. I was given the assignment and, on that course, the teacher spoke to the class about what we would learn in three weeks. He said something like, \"You're going to do research in three weeks; you're working on an issue and you'll be called upon to make a decision about it within two weeks\". My class was asked, \"What're you doing for three weeks?\" I just said yes and gave them my answer and then proceeded to study as if they hadn't asked me anything. I know how the assignment ended and I still don't remember what it was. So, at that point, I feel like I don't know the whole story. So, I guess I would say, if I were asking myself, \"what did I really want?...\" then I would say, \"to have a real relationship at the end of my second year\". I know I want to spend my third year of law school with my first real friend in my second year.\n\nI've always been an early bird. I can't complain or complain that I didn't get any sleep, though. The only thing they did to take advantage of me was that I had to do 10 minutes of practice with them, and then five minutes with my partner. That's why the first time they ever gave me my own private room, they wanted to get me to practice with them. They were so arrogant in how they treated me that day. They had a practice session every day with a different partner. So, I had to practice with one partner, and then the other partner had to practice with me. They could play around with it all they wanted, but I didn't want any practice because, it could have been more. I know the story well...it was something my mother had told me when, out of the blue, she said something about why I would be a lawyer, but never the actual reason...because I never learned anything for myself, because I never studied. I studied what I was taught to study; I wanted to learn that. I started out the year I signed up in November of 2009, the second year I started law school. I didn't realize it would be so hard because I was too scared to do anything different. I was afraid if I did the time would pass and then I wouldn't have the time. I didn't know the first few months of law school would be so hard to start. When I first started school, it seemed like it would be easy, but it only seemed like that because I had been around the same people my entire life, and I always did well. I was going to finish law school and then get a job right away. After graduation, I'd be working in the city. But now, here I am, trying to figure out what I want to do, how I want to spend my free time, and how I want to handle the transition that I'm going through.\n\nI really don't know. I remember when I was a law student, I thought I might go into criminal law. I did well on the MCAS exam in the first two years, and I was really scared to go to the actual trial. But then I realized, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. I remembered the second year of law school when I was so confused and was asked what the", "label": "gptneo"}

{"text": "Sophie Coles and Dave McDermott grew up yards apart in North London’s Docklands. But they’ve been at each other’s throats since their days at the University of East London (UE). When both moved to Glasgow for a post-graduate research-only degree, they began working together at Glasgow Life, where they’ve become the poster children for the city’s “cultural capital”.\n\nGlasgow is a city of culture. But not everyone has a cultural ‘heart.’\n\nIt’s here, says David Bell, convener of the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Capital Commission (CCCC), where Glasgow really steps up when it comes to supporting cultural creatives in the city.\n\nA city that is so busy with economic growth, it seems that if only cultural creatives (CCCs) were granted some space in its cultural economy, Glasgow would do them the world of good. Bell has argued that Glasgow’s ‘cultural heart’ shouldn’t be seen as a thing: It’s a state.\n\nGlasgow, a city where many might argue that the cultural heart doesn’t exist, is being made an international ‘cultural capital’ by the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Capital Commission. Their aim is to commission an internationally consistent scheme of awards to reward their city’s cultural creatives, with a global, national and local dimension.\n\nFor Glasgow 2014, which is this week, the initiative came about as a result of a call through Facebook for proposals for celebrating Glasgow 2014’s cultural assets – to create some award scheme that can be a ‘celebration’ rather than a ‘competition’.\n\nMore than 300 Glasgow-based cultural creatives have written to the CCC asking for proposals, and Bell said it had “taken some inspiration” from his earlier work with the UEA and the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Tourism Society (GCTS) to ‘build on all the goodwill we’ve had with them’, creating an award scheme that wouldn’t be judged, “but celebrated and recognised across the city”.\n\nThis week, the commission is officially unveiling the first of several schemes designed to celebrate the city’s unique cultural assets.\n\nAnd there are two very different versions of this scheme – with different aims, even with different forms.\n\nAn all-Celtic, all-the-time award\n\nThe Celtic Alliance\n\nAt Glasgow 2014, Glasgow’s ethnic and cultural heritage is celebrated by the Celtic Alliance. This is an ‘all-Celtic, all-time award scheme’.\n\nThe CCC has already been criticised for awarding an ‘all-Celtic, all-time award’ to Glasgow’s Calton Hill and for not acknowledging the diverse Glasgow’s ethnic communities. To do this, the award scheme has been re-branded.\n\nAt a meeting in Glasgow’s City Chambers last week, delegates to CCC outlined the ‘new’ scheme, with an award of ‘Celtic Cultural Heritage’ at a Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. At the top of the scheme is a prize of £10,000 – a lot of cash for Glasgow.\n\nA new award for the arts for Glasgow’s cultural creatives?\n\nThe Glasgow City Council have said they had had no input into the decision to include Glasgow 2014’s arts award. A council spokesman confirmed that “the new scheme was chosen because it is already recognised in culture; people recognise it and it’s easily recognisable”.\n\nThere is a lot riding on this contest.\n\nThe awards are intended to be “the largest and most culturally, culturally diverse awards programme in the UK” – and in addition to an ‘all-Celtic, all-time award’ also, “there is a large and very wide range of awards across all categories, from the Scottish Community Awards through to the CCC.”\n\nThe commission is committed to using existing awards to promote all Glasgow’s cultural assets, including “celebrating Scottish and local, international and regional arts talent as a whole, rather than focusing on cultural assets”. The CCC said that the award is designed to “encourage more creativity across the city”.\n\nThe scheme is funded by the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Tourism Society (GCTS), the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Capital Commission, Glasgow City Council and a £700,000 grant from the Royal Academy of Dance: all three local-level arts groups.\n\nThe initiative is backed – crucially – by a very clear, strong and clear plan.

{"text": "cross - linking of corneal collagen ( cxl ) is more efficient than the formation of croslite. However, to form croslip, the cells that are in the croslite must form a bridge. If the lumen surface, that which the cells are in contact and thus to adhere, has an irregular or jagged surface, then a bridge will not form and the cell will not adhere. Instead, the cell surface itself will jut out creating a ridge or crescenetto. Cells that form croslip are then forced to move to form a new crosle in order to renew the corneal collagen. In cases of the presence of scar from previous eye cataract surgery, then there is a period of time in which the scar tissue will hold the cells that are forming a crosle in a crescenetto pattern.\n\nA number of cell surface adhesion molecules have been shown to be crucial in the formation of croslip. Integrins are cell-surface adhesion molecules on the endothelial and epithelial cells of the corneal epithelium. A number of genes have been associated with the ability to create croslip. The integrin a2b1 (CD11b/CD18) has been associated and shown to be crucial in the formation of croslip. The integrin a3b1 (CD11b/CD18) is linked to formation of croslip. Thus croslip can form in the presence of integrin a3b1 (CD11b/ CD18). Croslip formation in the presence of this protein is not as complete as it is in the presence of integrin a2b1 (CD11b/CD18).\n\nFormation of a crosle occurs more in the presence of CD11b/CD18 and integrin a3b1 (CD11b/CD18).\n\nFormation of a crosle can be studied using an in vivo animal model, such as the Lewis rat. This means that this study of croslip formation is not just the presence or the absence of croslip; it is an assessment of the process that occurs to build a new crosle. The cells in this crosle have to migrate so that the new crosle can occur. In the study of croslip for glaucoma using this model, the integrin CD11b/CD18 was found to be involved in this migration. In order to further understand the role of CD11b/CD18 integrin on cell migration and scarring during glaucoma, this study investigated the CD11b/CD18 protein, integrins (a2b1 and a3b1), the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP 2 and 8) and the tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP).\n\nThe CD11b/CD18 protein, integrin a2b1 (CD11b/CD18), and the integrin a3b1 (CD11b/CD18) have been identified in previous studies. As CD11b/CD18 has been shown previously to be involved in the migration of corneal endothelial cells, corneal fibroblasts, and in the formation of croslip, it was studied if CD11b/CD18 is involved in the migration of corneal epithelial cells and glaucoma cells that form scar. In this study it was investigated and found that CD11b/CD18 is most important during the migration of corneal epithelial cells. CD11b/CD18 is also important in migration of corneal fibroblasts. CD11b/CD18 and integrins (a2b1 and a3b1) were shown to be important for cell migration, and CD11b/CD18 integrin was shown to be more important that a3b1 in cell migration. In addition, CD11b/CD18 and a2/b1 were shown to be important in migration of corneal endothelial cells.\n\nThe collagen of the cornea has previously been shown to have two types of fibers, the type I collagen as well as the type II collagen.\n\nHowever, there are now two types of collagen that are currently known, i.e., collagen IV in the endothelial cells as well as in the epithelial cells and collagen VI in the stromal cells of the human cornea.\n\nCollagen IV in the endothelial cells of the human cornea is similar to collagen I in the corneal stroma.\n\nIn the endothelial cells of the human cornea, it is found as type IV.\n\nIn the corneal epithelial cells, the protein that is produced by these cells is similar to type I collagen.

This is a darkly comedic tale of the miseries we face every day when we take control of our own lives.\n\nTitanic Town opened last fall as part of the New York Public Theater’s new Main Stage series, and for the first time a theatrical performance of the play was televised live on NYC’s WNYC-TV.\n\nJonathan Larson, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning plays The Silver Star and Other Plays and A Thousand Streets Under the Sea, is best known for his collaborations with Stephen Sondheim on the stage musicals Into the Woods and Saturday Night. But he has shown a knack for writing songs, and his songs have been used as the soundtrack for movies from “Toy Story” to “The Simpsons.” This is the second time Larson has written and directed a play for the NYC theatre, having done So, in 2008 and Sondheim Interrupted in 2005 (both were staged by the New York Shakespeare Festival). It was also the last time a play was performed live in front of a live audience, a tradition the new musical tries to change by broadcasting the action on a public television station.\n\nDespite its dark subject matter, Titanic Town doesn’t seem depressing. In it, a group of young urbanites in New York’s Lower East Side become fascinated by a series of mysterious “dreamscapes,” hallucinations of life lived out in the city by a pair of young women. After some experimentation it becomes clear to the group that each of them suffers from a form of “transparency,” a term popularly used to describe the phenomenon of seeing through someone else’s eyes, or experiencing another’s personality in your head. It becomes clear to each of them that by “opening their eyes up” to these visions, they will be able to see and live more fully, while having no more physical or emotional connections to the objects of this newfound sight.\n\nThe title of the play is a reference to the original Titanic’s loss, when one of its lifeboats failed to arrive at the scene of the sinking, and the survivors “took the name” of the lifeboat as their own.\n\nAs we watch the group “open their eyes” in this new piece, we are taken to a surreal place where dreams seem to be reality. The musical presents a “dreamscape” of a “scattered city” in which a couple on the subway make love. A girl, her eyes glazed over, is “staring off into the middle distance” while the man beside her has “a look of serenity and calm.” At a party, a young man with blond hair is struck “by the look on a woman’s face,” while another woman “tears at her eyes as though she is in great pain from some secret she cannot share.” There is a mysterious woman at the end of the street who is “smiling,” while a man with a long beard “pushes her aside…to get to the window overlooking the street,” where he “walks across the street,” seemingly “to nowhere.”\n\nAt the “home” there is a woman “sitting on the edge of her bed,” surrounded by a half-dozen framed photos, and “a tall man walks into the room with his eyes closed for most of the time.”\n\n“We don’t want to make this place into some sort of a ‘mythic realism,’” explains Larson. “It is a very specific world. We can have the illusion of realism, but not have to take the time to make everything believable. As you take on too much, you feel like you’re taking on yourself. That is the feeling I’m looking for in the piece. I think people do feel that sense of self-doubt. A writer sometimes feels that same sense of doubt; ‘How did he not make a great film?’ As you go through the play, you come to feel that self-doubt.”\n\nThe music has been written by Tim Lautret who wrote the title track of the musical. He came up with a set of simple, almost traditional melodies that would sound right with the mood of the production.\n\nMusic can be subjective, and “Titanic Town” is no exception.

According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, these products can help to relieve urinary tract and gynecological symptoms. The study subjects were 200 persons (aged between 15-65) with an average age of 36.0±10.3. The clinical symptoms were measured using the International Continence Society (ICS). Patients were evaluated in 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. Each of the subjects was randomly assigned to one of the three groups treated with 3 gm of powder of Dongxihuang, Dongxihuang and Yiyikangtang three times a day for 3 months. In order to examine the difference between pre and other three months, urine was collected for laboratory analysis and was tested using the three groups combined. There was no significant difference after treatment between the D and Y groups, and between the D and Y&G groups (p>0.05), while there was significant difference between the D and Y&G groups (p<0.05). It was the same for the D and Y&W groups (p<0.05). The improvement of ICS score was significant between D and D&W after treatment, D and G after treatment, D and Y&G after treatment (p<0.05). Three groups could reduce symptoms significantly (p<0.05), and it could be concluded that the effect of Dongxihuang and a combination of Dongxihuang and Yiyikangtang was better than that of the other three drugs combined together.

That graphic had a rather strange shape that was only slightly more interesting than a rectangle.\n\nThe image depicting the number of homicides and killings in the United States in 2009 was more interesting than a rectangle\n\nI had my suspicions, of course, and so when I saw the graphic showing number of murders across the United States on a map, I decided to take a closer look at it. The map turned out to be an interesting graphic in and of itself.\n\nThe map shows several different data components that are useful in understanding how mass killings are distributed across the country. There are several layers that make up this graphic, and they are separated by colored dots.\n\nThe first layer, the bottom layer on the map, is drawn on a black background. The top-right corner is a white line. In the bottom left corner is a larger white dot. The large white dot tells us that we are looking at a state or an entire region of a state.\n\nIn the background are red and pale green contours that show the location of homicides. They are contours that depict the locations of homicides. There are dots in the middle of the contour shapes — those black dots — that are the centers of the state’s homicides. The centers of those black dots are the locations of homicides by year.\n\nThe green dot in the upper left corner is at the center of the state and is the center of homicides by year.\n\nThe dark green contours that intersect those dots are mapped out as states of the state and the states represent the number of homicides that occurred in 2009. The color gradient from black to pale green represents the number of homicides that occurred in each state year by year.\n\nThe middle left corner is a blue shape that is a circle that represents the murders that occurred between 1999 and 2009. They are areas of the United States that are not homicides but which are shown by being shown as murders.\n\nThe uppermost horizontal line is also drawn as a circle representing the murders that occurred within the United States — the state and the region.\n\nThe second layer on the map is a shape that fills out just the top of the country and that starts off as a red dot. The shape is a black arc at the top left of the country. It represents the percentage of murders by state and year that occur in that state.\n\nIn the United States, all the red areas represent murders that occurred in the entire country in the year and all the black areas represent murders that occurred within the U.S.\n\nThe last three layers on the map are the colored dots that are drawn on by the colored circles. They are called clusters of clusters. Those clusters of clusters represent clusters of homicides that are mapped out based upon state and year, and they are drawn in green, blue, or red. The two clusters of clusters that represent large clusters of homicides that occurred in 2009 are in red and in yellow.\n\nIn 2009, there were four clusters of clusters on this map.\n\nTwo clusters of clusters – the yellow cluster in the upper left corner on the first layer of the map and the red cluster of clusters on the third and fourth layers of the map – were clusters drawn from the cluster of clusters located at the center of each of those clusters. These two clusters of clusters represent the second largest cluster of clusters at the top of the color of the clustering and they were drawn in red.\n\nThe third cluster of clusters that is in purple on the first layer in the lower right corner consists of clusters that occurred in a handful of states but that were drawn in the center of large clusters that occurred in more than two states. It is drawn in blue. The fourth cluster of clusters – red, in the top left corner on the third layer – represents a cluster of clusters that also occurred in a handful of states but drew in the center of clusters of clusters that occurred in more than two states.\n\nWhat these clusters of clusters show is that for every state that is mapped out, there is another cluster of clusters that covers just a portion of the total homicides in that state. When those clusters of clusters are drawn, they can occur across one state if it is mapped out and they are called clusters of clusters.\n\nHere are the clusters of clusters that are drawn for every state:\n\nCluster 1 – State # 1 – Cluster of clusters State # 2 – State # 2 State # 3 – State # 3 Cluster # 2 State # 3 - State # 3 Cluster # 3 State # 4 –", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "parathyroid hormone ( pth ) levels detected by intact pth-23, pth-31 and pth-33 immunofluorometric assay ( m.i.f. assay ) and the serum and urine pth-33, pth-35 and pth-36 immunoradiometric assays ( i.r.t assays). The results revealed no significant difference of m.i.f. assay and the serum and urine pth-33 immunoradiometric assays between the two groups. The serum pth-23 and m.i.f. assay were the best predictors of PTH level in the univariate analysis. However, in the multivariate analysis, the serum pth-23 immunoradiometric assay was the most reliable predictor of PTH level. The serum pth-35 was the highest (r = 0.917), m.i.f. assay was the next (r = 0.895) and urine pth-36 was the lowest (r = 0.864) with respect to the area under curve (p = 0.001). The results suggest that the pth-23, pth-31 and pth-33 immunoradiometric assays and the serum pth-33 immunoradiometric assays have a good correlation with the serum intact PTH concentrations in patients with multiple system atrophy. The serum pth-35 and m.i.f. assay, and the urine pth-36 immunoradiometric assay were the best predictors to PTH levels in the whole group. No significant difference in PTH value was detected between the two groups by any of three pthassays, or by the percentage of patients with higher PTH value. However, no case with negative PTH results also had elevated pth values and four cases with elevated PTH results had normal serum pth values. Serum and urine pth assays had no significant difference between patients in one group and patients in another. Our results suggest that the measurement of intact PTH concentrations with the two pth assays (i.e. serum and urine pth-33, pth-35 and pth-36) are suitable for their prediction in patients with multiple system atrophy.", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant in the United States, even if there is no proof that it will lead to the end of democracy in America. The argument was made by Professor Richard Wolff, a former chief economist for the World Bank, now at George Mason University, based on his analysis of a wide range of sources of the income statistics used in the United States. These analyses, he found, did not indicate a consistent relationship between the level of household income and the level of democracy.\n\nHe noted that the statistical methods used by the World Bank were flawed, and that much of the income-equality data and arguments on which economists of different persuasions based their analyses were misleading or flawed. The conclusions were made by leading figures in the profession, some of them among the most respected. There was also the problem that much of the research on income inequality in the United States was based on the surveys that were collected by the Income and Wealth project of the Center of Income Dynamics (CID) at the University of Michigan. For some years, that survey, which was run by the Institute for Social Research at Princeton University, had been collecting data on income and wealth. The authors of a recent article in the Review of Income and Wealth, published by the same organization, claimed that this survey was “more rigorous than the most recent Census survey.” The authors went on to criticize the Income and Wealth project for the use of non-standard approaches and other problems.\n\nIn response to these attacks on their work, the authors of the Review went on to say that non-standard methods are needed when surveying the behavior of the wealthiest, which includes many of the most well-off segments of American society. If those surveys are flawed methods, which they conceded would be the case, then the statistical analyses based on the survey should be considered unreliable. The analysis of the survey relied on a technique of regression analysis to show “that the standard measures of income inequality – the Gini index and the top and bottom quintiles – were closely linked to each other and to the distribution of individual income.” Such methodology should not be used as a basis for political debate, the authors suggested, but their own conclusion was that other methods were not sufficient.\n\nThe authors of the Review also criticized Wolff for his conclusions based on the analysis of various sources of income. Wolff rejected that criticism, concluding that the criticisms were based on cherry-picking, since their arguments did not apply to many sources he examined.\n\nThe fact is that Wolff’s criticisms of the income-statistics methods used by the World Bank were not based on a critique of the methodology, but on a critique of the conclusions drawn from those methods. What was missing in those analyses was “a broad cross-national study of incomes that also examined the political institutions that give the richest, most powerful country in the world its most powerful democratic state, and also a cross-national survey of the relationship of income and social mobility in these countries.”\n\nWolff’s analysis focused primarily on Germany, Britain and the U.S. His evidence was based on data from the surveys of the center of income dynamics conducted by the survey research institute of Princeton University. Wolff and his co-authors then made some adjustments to bring the data into the form most favorable to conclusions favorable to them. The resulting figures supported their argument.\n\nSome of the information used in the analysis of U.S. poverty, however, which was provided by the National Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago, was based on estimates of a measure called the poverty measure of family income. This measure is based on different assumptions from that used to determine poverty, and was based on different questions that might not be found in every country. According to the University of Chicago report, “the poverty income measure has been criticized on several grounds. One of the criticisms is that by requiring families to have the same size, number, and age composition it produces families with markedly different living standards which in turn produces misleading conclusions in the analysis.”\n\nWolff criticized the use of U.S. poverty as “a poor substitute for the European measures because poverty indicators in Europe have much higher correlations with democracy. But it [the U.S. poverty indicator] makes a more powerful claim – that income inequality is the primary cause of democratic dysfunction.” He also pointed to U.S. studies carried out by the Bureau of Economic in-stitution which indicated that “there has been only a weak correlation between incomes and levels of democracy.”\n\nWhile such criticisms were made to the extent that it was useful for the argument – that the United States was not a democracy – they did not constitute an analysis of the relationship between income inequality and democracy, and, therefore, does not support the conclusions of the authors who produced these statistics and criticized Wolff for drawing conclusions from them.\n\nIn the introduction to his article,", "label": "gptneo"}
{"text": "aims : to estimate depression in patients with age -related hearing loss, based on self -report. The study sample included patients with age related hearing loss and the control group consisted of subjects without age related hearing loss. Both patient groups took part in a self -report scale of depression. It was found that the level of depression was higher in patients with age related hearing loss compared to subjects without age -related hearing loss. The increase in depression level correlated with hearing loss duration. The highest level of depression in comparison to subjects without age related hearing loss was found in patients with stage 3 hearing loss.\n\nAim : To examine the psychomotor performances of patients with type 1 familial hypercholesterolemia compared to healthy subjects. The participants had type 1 familial hypercholesterolemia and were age matched to healthy subjects. They took part in a computerized and a pen-and-paper test battery that included the Stroop colour word test, Trail making test A and B, digit span test A and B, and Rey auditory verbal learning test. It was found that patients with type 1 familial hypercholesterolemia had significantly slower psychomotor performance compared to healthy subjects. However, there was no significant difference in psychomotor performance in patients with type 1 familial hypercholesterolemia compared to healthy subjects in terms of their Stroop colour word or Trail making A and B.\n\nAim : To describe the short form 36 (SF-36) health survey of patients with chronic hepatitis C and to examine the relationship between the variables in the survey and psychological factors. The study population was selected from patients who were attended in two clinics affiliated to the Department of Internal Medicine of a state hospital. The SF36 health survey was given to all the participants who gave informed consent. Of the 50 participants, 31 (62%) were hepatitis C positive and 19 (38%) were hepatitis C negative. The demographic and clinical data of the subjects were recorded. The SF36 survey was administered. Descriptive statistics were used to study the mean. The study was a cross-sectional survey of all patients with chronic hepatitis C; therefore, a correlation test was done and the t -test (independent variables and dependent variables, respectively) was used to evaluate the strength of the significant results. The results obtained in this cross sectional survey demonstrated that the subjects had good health status and high social support scores. However, low scores in physical health were noted. Also, there was no significant correlation between disease severity and the SF36 summary data or any of the questions in the survey.\n\nPurpose : The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of migraine in patients with thyroid disorders. Materials & Methods : A total of 474 patients with thyroid disorders were selected and studied using a questionnaire with three parts and two sections. Of the 474 patients, there were 220 (48%) males and 244 (52%) females with a mean age ± SD of 41.3 ± 17.3 years. Also, 50 (11%) patients had migraine and 46 (10%) patients had other types of primary headaches. Results : Among the patients with thyroid disorders without headache, 54 (11%) migraine and 50 (12%) with other primary headache types. Among the patients with thyroid disorders with headache, 17 with migraine (35%) and 15 with other primary headache types (30%). Conclusions : Migraine is a headache type with a high prevalence among patients with thyroid disorders without headache. Therefore, migraine should be a high priority for investigation regarding the pathophysiological mechanism, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment.\n\nPurpose : The aim of this study was to detect the presence of the Y chromosome using a commercial kit; a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the DNA of a specific Y chromosome segment in the plasma of patients with testicular tissue hypoplasia (TTXHA). Materials & Methods : From September to November 2016, blood samples were collected to be analyzed by PCR for detecting the Y chromosome in the patients with TTXHA (n = 22). A total of 42 samples were also analyzed for the presence of the Y chromosome in the case control study groups; 22 patients with TTXHA, 22 patients with testicular cancer and 20 controls (patient that have received orchiopexy or cancer patients, age range was 5-70 years-old). Results : The male patients with TTXHA were found to have 2% (2/22) and female patients with TTXHA were found to have 14.9% (2/14) positive plasma samples. In the case control study group, a total of 13 patients with TTXHA, 13 patients with testicular cancer and 12 controls were analyzed; of them, a total of 1% (1/13 patients with TTXHA) and 12.5% (2/12 patients with TTXHA) were positive for the Y chromosome. Conclusion : The results of this study suggest that the presence of the Y chromosome in the plasma of patients with TTX", "label": "gptneo"}
