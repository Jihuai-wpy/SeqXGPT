While it is obvious they are dealing with some seriously \"dumb\" people, what could they have done? Should the CIA have been monitoring everything the Russians are doing? Sure. But then the CIA might have been monitoring the CIA. And would you really want to live your entire life, and the life of everyone nearby, under constant surveillance, by the gov't? I hope there's more to come in the storyline, as it could have been really cool... or it could also be what it is; a silly, dumb movie. If you have an hour to waste, I'd say enjoy it.\n\n\"It was only natural for everyman to see what was happening in Afghanistan and he just couldn't hold back his feelings. \"No doubt, the American soldier has to bear the burden of this war,\" BigalC said.\"\n\nIt was only natural for everyman to see what was happening in Afghanistan and he just couldn't hold back his feelings. And this movie made us want to put him in the front line. It was also natural for him to have feelings for what was going on, for the people and everything he experienced. The film makers wanted the viewer to see what the average people experience and how they are affected. To make a comparison I have to say that a story about the Vietnam War was pretty boring and this one was not. It was the first movie I have seen that made me feel like I was there to witness every moment in an Afghani life.\n\nIf you are a soldier reading these comments, be proud of your job. You have to think for yourself about what you do and fight for it. That is great American talent. We are a democracy and we shouldn't have to make it to this point to know the right way of doing things. Soldiers are not a necessary evil at the front line, as we have seen over the past few decades. I feel so much about the people I served with in the military, and am always in their back pocket. The media has really lost its way. So far this movie is showing it.\n\nI've never really been one to be critical of a movie, but to be honest - this one was terrible. It was full of stereotypes and was pretty much just a waste of time. It never did what it set out to do. It was way too short.\n\nI'm willing to give a movie that much but really I just feel that the people involved should have been more creative. The writers should have come up with something original, the star actors should have done enough to make me believe they lived in Afghanistan, the director should have done little more than tell a story.\n\nYou cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot create polls in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "The Roman and Celtic coins, which date from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD and are found in large numbers in the Roman city, show that coins and circulation played a key role in the establishment and development of cities in this region. The coins represent a wide variety of mints, and many issues are closely related in terms of their design and composition, thus showing the importance of money as an element of urban planning and the formation of a local economic and trading network. The coins are very beautiful and their design also exhibits great artistic expression, with the most characteristic feature of the coins being that of the image of the city and its gods. All of this is linked very closely to the establishment of the Roman influence, which in turn was a decisive factor in the development of cities in the Roman province of Britannia from the 1st until the 3rd century AD.\n\n(In the picture to the right: 1st-3rd century Roman/Celtic coins found in London, at the British Museum. 1st century AD, 2nd century AD. 3rd century AD.)\n\nRoman coins\n\nThe Roman Empire was a highly urbanised system. In contrast to the more traditionally agriculturally oriented cities of previous periods, it adopted city planning and developed a great degree of infrastructure and developed urbanisation across the Empire and beyond. The Romans were interested in making the most of their city centres, such as Rome itself or the imperial cities such as Alexandria (Egypt), Carthage (Tunisia), Constantinople (Constantinople), Ephesus, Pergamum, or Nicomedia (near Izmir). The city was always the centre of an economic, cultural and political system. The Roman imperial cities are a large collection of urban agglomerations, the urban agglomerations were often surrounded by walls, fortifications or both.\n\nThe City of London is the capital city of London and the largest in the country, with a population of 875,000 (2000) within the greater London boundary.\n\nIn 1871, the Office of Works was set up to manage the public space. It established the main roads, parks, bridges and fountains. They also had the responsibility of maintaining all the sewers, water pipes and other infrastructure of the city. Today, the Office of Works is the London Corporation, charged with a number of roles such as the maintenance of London’s roads and other public realm.\n\nDuring the course of the second millennium, London was in a position to grow without restraint, and as a result, it developed into the global city of the late twentieth century. This boom and the building boom that followed, the creation of new offices and offices that required new housing, the expansion of the transport sector, and urban planning which resulted in the creation of a large amount of new construction, together with the constant growth throughout the last millennium made the growth in Greater London unstoppable over the century (Figure 1).\n\nThe boom began during the 1980s and continues throughout the 1990s; it is expected that the metropolitan area of London will remain a key position in Europe, as an international finance centre and one of the most important business-related hubs.\n\nThe urban space\n\nThe expansion of London, as an international financial centre, led to an expansion of the population from 1,300,000 (in 1800) to more than six million in 2016, and it has been the biggest city in the world since the beginning of the century. The population in Greater London grew over eightfold in two hundred years, and London’s population had a yearly growth rate between 1500 and 1700 of 2.8% (Cannadine).\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the London’s urban area covered 1,430 square kilometres. Since then, this urban space has continued to increase at a rate of around 6 kilometres every year.\n\nThe growth in Greater London is therefore the main reason for the expansion of the city, which is reflected in the increase in the population and the expansion in the outer area. At the beginning of the twenty first century, the ‘outer perimeters’ of London consisted of 1,500 square kilometres, which is almost four times the area covered by London in 1850, showing an average population growth ranging between 20 and 36%, and a peak growth rate of 47% (Wrigley and Schofield).\n\nThis growth of the city’s outer boundaries in the form of urban sprawl is a phenomenon common throughout the British Isles. Over the last century, the rapid expansion of cities, at first in the north and later south and east has led to a large and continuous transformation of the spatial configuration of British cities and towns, resulting in a vast and heterogeneous complex of villages, rural and urban areas, expanding over increasingly wider distance than the former villages and cities or the historic city centre (Figure 2).\n\nThe study carried out between 1868 and 2012 – ‘Greater London and the", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "rotocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is a great actor in her prime at the height of her powers: Halle Berry, who is every bit as cool as James Bond. However, Halle Berry is the only thing about this movie that makes sense.\n\nIt might not sound so bad when one reads the script: Halle Berry's character, Lola, is a drug pusher, and James Bond just wants to meet her in Cuba (which he doesn't find) so he can get the information without being kidnapped (which he also does find out in some other way) which will eventually lead him to a plan to capture the villains and eventually the villains' home base. This is all explained fairly accurately as long as you understand how Halle Berry's character gets her drugs.\n\nOne would think that the movie was going to be about Lola as a drug pusher, but she also has a sister who is working for the FBI. A couple of agents are working undercover to look for her, so they have the run-around until they finally find Lola's sister. When they do, they reveal that Lola's job is to sell the information she gets from the terrorists (they are planning to blow up American ships or planes) to the highest bidders, so that the highest bidder can then blow up the ships and planes.\n\nThe trouble is, these terrorists are very clever, and the agent who is assigned to tail her knows Lola is a drug dealer, so she calls out her cover. Lola, who is only there to help her sister, thinks she is getting out of something easy, and is actually willing to sell information about the planned attacks on American aircraft carriers. This is about as crazy as it sounds, as they have agents flying in on C130's with hundreds of pounds of explosives to destroy one of the largest, most heavily armed American vessels in the history of the United States, and Lola says, \"Oh dear, it really does sound stupid and dangerous. How about I just call it off and you tell 'em you didn't hear nothing?\"\n\nAfter spending some time at her sister's place, Lola decides to head off alone to a rendezvous she can set up there with a buyer she is certain will go home and try to find out if the deal actually went through, or if the plan was scrapped because the agent tipped off the FBI. Her plan involves a small Cessna plane, and a very heavy cocaine load.\n\nIf you can read the dialogue and put yourself in the mind of the characters, it is possible to figure out what is going on. The trouble is, the screenplay tries to do more than the story it has. The trouble is, the story is as follows:\n\n• First, there is the small aircraft with two tons of blow. It had to be a small aircraft. It could be a Cessna, but they don't fly Cessna 182-T Skyraiders around Cuba all day long.\n\n• One other thing--what's to stop them from just calling the FBI or the air force and saying, \"Hey, we have your woman and if you want to come get her, we'll tell her the bombs are off and we won't blow the boats up\"? The only thing that works against that is the fact that she would have to bring them both out alive, and only the second agent had the chance to blow up the plane with the bombs. Then when he sees his partner, he just goes home. If it were actually that easy, we could watch Lola get caught, fly home with a little money that she really doesn't have a lot of in America, and then start all over again. She is the only real character in this movie, which is pretty much about Agent James Bond and his friend Agent Wint. No one else has any reason other than to get back where she came from.\n\n• Finally, it wouldn't be Lola. It would be the agent, whom Bond, as he has to since it didn't occur to the scriptwriter that anyone else could come up with the idea to blow up an airplane with tons of explosives. He doesn't work as a double agent at her sister's place; he is just there in case they were actually successful.\n\n• There may be another purpose. The movie ends with Bond having a \"nice trip\" (which is how it actually is), and he gets Lola safely out of Cuba before her sister dies. The last thing it's said is that Lola works for the FBI and that Bond and his friend were good at getting things, too, \"The best I've ever seen.\" No reason to be surprised at that--Bond is a British agent.\n\nI was never able to figure out why the CIA sent in a \"girl\" with explosives on a Cessna plane. I think the idea was to prove to her that the CIA was serious about getting her out", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have different names for different goods. In economics this is called the classification problem: the problem of identifying which rule applies to a particular good.  (A good being something that one wants to make money on, if you're familiar with economics it may be more accurately paraphrased by saying the classification problem is the problem of identifying which class of goods one wants to sell.)\nI think the rules that govern classified items in a store aren't really rules at all but merely descriptions of the items. A store sells these items based on descriptive features (the brand and the price range), and the way they are classified here is really just a matter of convenience - if you have a store which sells the items listed above, there's really no way to determine if it follows any specific rules. If, for example, you wanted a store to sell a box of chocolates but it only had three types - you could look in the store at the classification descriptions, and you might think of buying a chocolate at all three places, but it would be a strange situation where it didn't know whether all the chocolates were considered the same or whether they were all considered different.\nOf course, there is in fact a common classification scheme in use for these items - it's known as primary colour, which is typically a classification into red or green or blue. I suppose you could also talk about \"natural\" red and \"natural\" green and \"natural\" blue, which might be a sub-classification for any of the three basic colours - i.e. the \"natural\" colour that's closest to either of the basic colours in the sense that you can go from one to the other by changing that particular colour, and then go further to the extremes - red may have a sub-classification of \"bright\" red and \"really quite dark\" red, and the same for green and blue.\nBut even this scheme is pretty informal: in fact, even in primary colour you can't say that the primary colour refers to a particular basic colour, but rather it refers to the one with the most \"energy\" (I'll try to get a better explanation for this concept that I just made up, if no one else has any good way to do it). Similarly, if chocolate was a primary colour, it could have no sub-classifications at all; if it were, it would simply be \"food\" - the food in a box of chocolates, and not necessarily the colour of chocolate that it is (a sub-classification in the case of food) or its contents (a sub-sub-classification).\n\nA:\n\nYou're not describing a recipe, but a taxonomy, there's a difference, you may also find it in taxonomies, like the USDA or the FDA:\nhttp://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/AOAC_FS_0050.pdf\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfTR/CFTR.cfm?CDRID=1618.\nThere it's common to put the different items in a box, with a set of rules determining where you must sell it (in the sense of a taxonomic relationship between the items and the rules).\n\n", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 2/5s stars is because it was made by a man trying really, really hard to be a woman on screen. Yes, this film has some good points, but it feels too long and there are several other things that should have been done better.\n\nBut before I begin, I'd like to point out that I think this film's director, James Kent (born a man) was trying too hard to \"be\" a woman, and some of his decisions aren't even close to being a female (except that he has breasts on-screen of course) - he's almost as far from being a woman as he would be from being a man.\n\nSo let's begin with the positives first.\n\n1.) There are some positives.\n\nThe first positive is that there are some points where it seems like the filmmakers are making a film about women and their problems and this is a step in the right direction. For example, in the beginning the main character has an abortion which makes her feel a lot of guilt, pain, and regret. Her husband says that she had better things to do than getting pregnant with him (that's the line when the character explains to her husband that she had an abortion).\n\nBut then in later parts of the film, the main character tells the viewers that abortion is a bad idea, and that you're better making a child with your husband and raising it in the best interest of that child.\n\nBut the problem is that she contradicts herself twice and it seems like she's trying too hard to come across as a woman on a mission to make a film and she's only telling the audience what they want to hear.\n\nAnother example about the character being too much of a man instead of a woman is when the main character is in a parking garage where she tells her friend that she and her husband will raise their kids in this garage because it'll be cheaper than having a car and her friend is like:\n\nBut this friend is supposed to be a woman because she has boobs (those, and of course she has them on-screen. The character is also shown as having long, blonde hair. I'm almost positive that this woman has never been on this planet in a million years, because her appearance and dialogue have made her a man).\n\nOne more example is on the character's husband - he tells her that he wants a baby so they can raise their kids together, and she's worried about him leaving her because she's a woman (she's always trying to make herself better than her husband, which is odd because she keeps referring to him as \"my husband\").\n\n2.) There are some points of feminism.\n\nThere are times where the directors of this film are trying to show the idea of women being equal to men - they point out how much more \"manly\" men are than women are.\n\nThis point was made in how some women have menial jobs and men are usually more \"manly\" and have more power in a workplace, which makes them \"better.\"\n\nThey also point out how women are usually on a mission to have a baby because they're told that having a baby would make them better as individuals.\n\nBut their feminism also points out how women are always trying to make themselves better than they were previously. Because they always feel like they're not good enough, they also try to make themselves \"better\" through getting plastic surgery, getting cosmetic procedures like having \"a real breasts,\" waxed eyebrows, using lotion, and looking perfect in order to appear better to other men and get more attention. They'll also dress or act sexy in order to be more attractive to men.\n\nThey also get plastic surgery, not because they want to have a baby, but because they want to look better in front of men, women, and everyone else.\n\nThe film also states that men will always prefer women who are more manly or look better in an effort to get women to conform to what they want.\n\nIt's very obvious that this film made by a man was made in an effort to help a lot of women, but the film ends up making it seem like one large joke. The film starts out with the main character having an abortion (something that she regrets later in the film), the main character has her face fully (or near-fully) covered up, and it looks like she has on a head scarf. And there's something underneath the head scarf but I haven't seen any clips from the film.\n\nHer outfit consists of wearing a skirt that's extremely transparent and also reveals her butt - a lot! The character also has long, blonde hair. Then they start talking about women being sexy in an effort to show that the film was made with a feminist theme, but then it goes downhill quickly.\n\n3.) \"I Wasn't Real But Now I'm The Real", "label": "gptj"}

According to Star Wars legend, the city was built by the Jedi under the direction of an unknown \"Old Jedi\". At least that's what the Star Wars games and RPG's tell you. The truth is slightly different. The city, and the people who live in it, are, well they're pretty good at making money. They were first to get the jump on New Alderaan before the Empire, or the First Order, invaded it.\n\nThe first generation of New Alderaanian citizens were refugees from the New Alderaan system. The New Alderaanians were known to be people who came from the old New Alderaan system. They were refugees who were escaping the planet and they ended up starting their lives off in a foreign city. They settled there first, but as they became more prosperous, they gradually returned to their homeland, to the original city of New Alderaan. New Alderaan still remained a small city at that time, as the Jedi had just begun using New Alderaan for shelter. New Alderaanians quickly adopted the Galactic Nuts and Zaxes (the original species made famous by the Old Republic era), and built out the city and its technology. Within New Alderaan, the New Alderaanians took control of the government, the military, banking, finance, law enforcement, and most other industries. The New Alderaanians eventually took control of all the planets in the New Alderaan star system.\n\nThe New Alderaanians were a people who valued their culture and traditions and they were proud of them. Although it was their original planet, they refused to forget their roots and they kept many aspects of the traditions and culture of their home planet. They were a people who believed that there was no place for the old ways in the New Alderaan system. For most New Alderaanians, New Alderaan was their home world, but there were a few who still dreamt of their original home, even though it was thousands of light years away. The Nuts and Zaxes have been a symbol of hope for a long time. People dreamt of living with their kind again on their home planet. They always maintained a connection with their \"home planet\", even though they all lived out of state. They called it home only at the night time.\n\nHowever, these New Alderaanians also had a high regard for the culture of the New Republic. The Nuts and Zaxes were a strong symbol for the New Republic, as well as for New Alderaan. People on different planets had different experiences and ideas that influenced them to form a unique, rich, diverse and individualized society. New Alderaanians were proud of their history, and they had pride in their culture as well. They were still New Alderaanians after all. They continued to build their society. They still maintained their traditions and their culture. Many New Alderaanians still believed that it was the \"home planet\". It was the planet where they were born. It was the planet they loved.\n\nAfter the Yuuzhan Vong War, New Alderaanians started to see themselves as a part of a larger galactic community- as a \"Galactic Citizen\" as much as any other Star Wars character. They still loved their traditions and culture, but they had come to believe that their homeland was gone. It had been taken away from them. But they still remembered and cherished their home. They kept their roots in the home planet as a symbol and a reminder to themselves of what they once knew, what they once loved, and to not forget their own roots. They kept their heritage, their traditions, their language, their culture, and their society intact. They just kept their traditions, but they were no longer content with them being the only symbol of their culture and their heritage. They began to embrace more than one symbol of their heritage and culture. They embraced it all. They wanted their descendants too remember the past. The New Alderaanians kept New Alderaanian values alive through the ages and their culture survived. They gave their descendants all the knowledge and knowhow of their origins. They tried hard to teach them, just like they were taught as children. They lived on their past, their heritage. But they wanted them to remember where they came from as well. They helped them to remember their home, to remember their past, and to remember their roots. The New Alderaanians always looked back and they lived in the memories of their true past, the past of their home planet New Alderaan.\n\nSo, the New Alderaanians set out on their mission to return home. They started from the old city of New Alderaan and their journey would take them to the Old City of Alderaan. When they arrived, they would reunite with", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "we discuss the nonlinear current of an interacting quantum dot coupled to a superconductor as well as to a ferromagnetic lead. As a main result we obtain a fully analytic expression for this current as expressed in Eq. , which can be evaluated in a very rapid approximation using the recursive Green’s function algebra. The analytical result for the current simplifies to the familiar BCS current if the Kitaev coupling $J$ vanishes. In contrast to the superconducting case, the current is nonzero even in the weak coupling limit since the coupling between the dot and the ferromagnetic lead is not taken into account. Moreover, the current is also non-monotonic in the coupling between the dot and the superconducting lead and is always finite. Hence, superconducting ferromagnetic leads also offer a natural realization of the Majorana fermion physics.\n\nWe start to discuss the dot-superconductor junction in Section \\[sec:SCdotSC\\]. There we give the Hamiltonian of the system and discuss the particle hole symmetric case. In Section \\[sec:Kitaev\\] we discuss the particle hole asymmetric case and, in the last section, we discuss the ferromagnetic lead.\n\nFerromagnetic lead — zero Kondo coupling limit {#sec:SCdotSC}\n==============================================\n\nIn this section we introduce the basic setup of the system considered in this article: a double quantum dot coupled via an exchange field to a spin-polarized ferromagnetic lead. In Section \\[sec:Kitaev\\] the exchange field is turned off. We will see that for this case Majorana physics is not possible. In Section \\[sec:SCdotSC:coupl\\] the tunnel coupling to a superconducting lead is turned on to simulate Kitaev Majorana fermions in the magnetic junction.\n\nThe superconductor can be modeled by a sine-Gordon model: $$\\begin{aligned}\n   {{\\mathcal{H}}}^\\text{SC}=&\\sum_{j\\sigma} {{\\varepsilon}}_j^\\text{SC}\n   c^{\\dagger}_{j\\sigma} c^{\\phantom\\dagger}_{j\\sigma} \n   +t\\sum_{\\sigma} \n   (c^\\dagger_{1\\sigma} c^{\\phantom\\dagger}_{2\\sigma}+{\\mathrm{h.c.}}) \\notag\\\\\n   & +\\int{\\mathrm{d}}x\\, {{\\mathcal{H}}}^\\text{SC}_I\\Big|_{S:I=1}\\notag\\\\\n  =& \\sum_\\sigma {{\\varepsilon}}_{1}^\\text{SC} \\, \\widetilde c_{1\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\widetilde\n   c_{1 \\sigma}^{\\phantom\\dagger}\n + \\sum_\\sigma {{\\varepsilon}}_{2}^\\text{SC} \\, \\widetilde c_{2\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\widetilde\n   c_{2 \\sigma}^{\\phantom\\dagger} \\notag\\\\\n & + \\sum_\\sigma 2t \\cos(2k_F x) \\Big( \\widetilde d^\\dagger_{1\n   \\sigma} \\widetilde\n   d^{\\phantom\\dagger}_{2 \\sigma}\n  - \\sin(k_Fx)\\, \\Phi^{ \\phantom\\dagger}_{1\\sigma} \n  \\Phi^\\dagger_{2\\sigma} \\Big) \\notag \\\\\n   &+\\sum_{{\\mathbf{k}}\\sigma\\sigma'}\n   \\big[\n   h_{1}(\\sigma) {c^{\\dagger}_{1\\sigma,\\mathbf{k}\\sigma'}}\n   {c^{\\phantom\\dagger}_{1 \\sigma', \\mathbf{k}\\sigma}}\n   + h_1(\\sigma)^* {c^{\\dagger}_{1 \\sigma, \\mathbf{k}\\sigma'}}\n   {c^{\\phantom\\dagger}_{1 -\\sigma,  \\mathbf{k}\\sigma}}\n   \\big] \\notag\\\\\n   &+\\sum_{{\\mathbf{k", "label": "gptj"}

He also had non- specific oral ulcers associated with mild gingivorrhoea. His other symptoms included reduced oral sation, bilirubinaemia, high serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase activities.\n\nHis past medical history was significant for the previous excision of multiple head and neck warts. There was no history of intravenous drugs use or contact with chickenpox.\n\nHe gave no history of travel outside the UK but had spent a little over a month working in the restaurant of a holiday camp in Greece. He visited Greece on 6 July 1995 and returned on 11 July 1995. He presented on 7 August 1995 with a maculopapular rash over his trunk and arms which began on 13 August 1995. He experienced non-pruritic burning mite skin reactions over all parts of his trunk at various times.\n\nOn 17 August 1995 a rash over his scalp with a raised crust over the scalp, resembling chickenpox, was present. He developed similar lesions on the palms of his hands and feet on 18 August 1995; he claimed to believe this was due to a mosquito bite.\n\nThe patient was seen in the Dermatology Department at Great Ormond Street Hospital on 22 August 1995 and a skin biopsy was taken. Specimens of warts from the patient's mouth and arm were sent for histological examination and the patient was commenced on doxycycline to treat possible systemic infection. The histology of the arm wart showed similar morphological appearances as described by Brinker and Jones [1]. The specimen showed warts with well defined keratinocytes which had undergone keratinization and appeared squamous in arrangement. However, a skin surface biopsy was also sampled and the result of the histology of this lesion showed a wart with more typical morphological features of keratoacanthoma (Fig. 1). The clinical features and histological features correlated well with those of Brinker and Jones [1] and we concluded that the head and scalp and arm warts were typical verrucae vulvae. However, although a well defined raised erythema and keratotic crust with surrounding lymphadenopathy are characteristic features of varicella-zoster virus infection, a more definitive diagnosis could not be made. The patient was subsequently referred to the Haematology department for further management and the patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir for 5 days.\n\nFig. 1\n\nSkin biopsy: The specimen shows warts with well defined keratinocytes which had undergone keratinization and appeared squamous in arrangement. A skin surface biopsy also sampled, the result of which shows a wart with more typical morphological features of keratoacanthoma\n\nAs a result of this case report, some questions arose. Should lesions be sampled from warts which are only at a localised stage? If the histology showed only well defined warts, does that mean that they are actually viral warts and will clear with adequate treatment? If they show the morphological features of a keratoacanthoma, should they be classified as a malignant lesion? What about the potential for warts to develop at multiple sites as in this case?", "label": "gptj"}

In this interview, Dick Martin and Dan Rowan--who will have much to say to each other because, while the hosts and writers do interview one another on Laugh-In, they are not supposed to give one another any ammunition--talk about the kind of stories they will write on the show, their favorite guests who have sat in the studio with them, and some of the things they love now. They also talk about the time they dressed up in drag as the Andrews Sisters for an afternoon on the NBC Burbank lot.\n\nWhat made you decide it was time to do a new show on TV again?\n\nDICK MARTIN: We've done the Tonight Show so much we thought, \"Let's try something new.\" My first show was back in 1953 and Dick was the assistant producer. What amazes me about it is that the three of us are still here--as are most of the people who were there on the first show.\n\nYour show's success was due, in part, to being a show that wasn't afraid of being a show. Even though you were only on at 7:30, you stayed light and you had some people who were willing to do comedy. What would be like to have a show now that was a comedy?\n\nROWAN: On my first show we were almost all people who had been on Amos & Andy, because we didn't know any other funny people. Today you don't have to be afraid to be funny... and now there are comedy clubs all over the world.\n\nHow would what the audience expects be different on your new show?\n\nMARTIN: A show that isn't afraid to be a comedy. It's more serious than we're used to, but we want to give them something that's a little lighter.\n\nHave you always been more of the story-teller, or has that role fallen to you?\n\nMARTIN: Dick used to be the story-teller. He still is.\n\nROWAN: We are always telling stories.\n\nMARTIN: Today, we're telling stories. Before, we used to have the people tell the stories, the way you see on the movies.\n\nHow about stories you will tell?\n\nMARTIN: We'll probably tell stories of the people who show up on our show. We'll probably do more interviews, like we did the first time.\n\nDan, one of the people who appeared on Laugh-In was David Wayne. He was an actor, a singer and even wrote a few songs. How much did you write for your own show?\n\nROWAN: Dave didn't write any songs, Dick. We had three writers who wrote, sang, and acted.\n\nWhere are some of your favorite songs that were written for the show?\n\nMARTIN: We had a song written by David, a couple by Fred Freeman, and one by Danny Kaye.\n\nDan, what was your favorite thing about the show?\n\nROWAN: When it started, we had two characters who were kind of a little offbeat... Charlie and Dick. They would say \"We like you--because you like us!\"\n\nMARTIN: We wanted them to be two very funny guys, and they were both very funny; we didn't make them too serious. We wanted them to laugh at each other.\n\nDick, you had been a producer on the show before.\n\nMARTIN: I loved it so much that when the two of us got tired of running the show after almost 20 years, I just walked away from it. Now Dick loves it. He's had his fingers in every pie.\n\nIs this your first big show on television?\n\nROWAN: People who know us said in our heyday, when we didn't do this show, that Dick was never out of bed before 7:30, if he walked out on a movie set he would be on the set at 4:00. Now he's been on so many that it's become easy.\n\nMARTIN: I think that it is more like a stage play than a TV show. If you do a TV show long enough, then it becomes like a stage show.\n\nDan, what type of show do you think this is going to be: Are you going to try to keep it light, or do you plan to let people know how serious this show is?\n\nROWAN: We want it to be funny and serious.

{"text": "I am a big fan of old horror movies, and I've already watched several of J.H. Warner's many classic Universal Studios films over the weekend. I was recently in a discussion with some fellow horror fanatics about the great horror host Vincent Price, and it would be very cool to share a couple of Vincent's horror movie stories about the amazing creature effects that were used in the golden era of movie monsters.\n\nVincent was a horror host in a variety of ways, from his legendary appearances on the old anthology series \"The Chiller Theatre\" hosted by Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, to co-hosting the first \"Creature Features\" show on the nascent local television network called WFIL Channel 6 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Vincent was the first host of the weekly science fiction anthology TV series, The Ray Bradbury Theater (1966-1967), and his last horror movie hosting gig was for the cult series \"The Monkees\", the TV sequel of sorts to the Monkees rock band that ran from 1966 to 1968. Vincent was, in addition to all these, a successful and prolific writer and director of horror films, and he was incredibly smart, witty, and quick of wit. If anyone of you out there needs any advice on how to succeed in the life of a horror host, this guy is an excellent example to follow.\n\nVincent was particularly fond of monster movies, and in this two-part interview, he shares some of his favorite stories about the creature effects used in the horror movies that he starred in and hosted.\n\nThe story of Vincent on \"Mister Sinister\" has been told many times before, because he co-starred in the classic horror film with Boris Karloff produced by Universal Studios in 1942. In Vincent's words, \"This is the film with the green skin, and the big mouth! I had a great time making this film. We spent a month on location in Los Angeles. It was an amazing movie. We made a lot of money on this one. I was lucky that this was happening when I was making my own feature starring Boris Karloff, although the director was Joe May!\"\n\nThe famous image, courtesy of the \"Mister Sinister\" poster above, shows Boris Karloff's character standing on the rooftop across the street from what looks like an old factory, with Vincent standing right next to him waving both of his arms. It is, of course, the iconic scene in the movie where Boris Karloff's character, \"Mister Sinister\", reveals his face for the first time with the creature's visage appearing on Karloff's right eye. After giving the evil creature all the evil details, the camera pans to the building behind them, and the next few shots take place inside the factory as the actor in the lead role is revealed to actually be Vincent Price as he fights off the monster as well as Mr. Karloff himself. It is the only Universal Studios horror movie that I've seen with live animal actor's footage as opposed to animatronic, doll, or muppet creations.\n\nI wonder about the use of live actors in the film, though? The shot of Karloff's character on the rooftop looks very awkward, as if someone were taking a photo of a subject who was not quite looking at the camera. Karloff looks like he is looking down upon Vincent as the monster's face materializes across his eye, while Vincent is being somewhat annoyed, as it were, by the other actor. I really like the way the sequence turns out, and the way the whole thing plays into the theme of the movie which is all about the evil power of the human eye. I'd like to believe that it would have been better to film the scene as animated, but that would also change the tone of the whole thing, and it wouldn't have the same kind of authenticity of using the actors in the sequence as it did.\n\nWhile the monster's face is being projected onto Karloff's eye, one might expect the actor will be able to blink or at least close his eyes to block out the projected visage, but Karloff is perfectly still. The image of his face fades into the monster's visage, while Vincent is still being annoyed. It's very well done, and it's not unlike watching the actual scene unfold, as if a real person is the one looking through the eye of the camera, and another character is getting photographed.\n\nVincent Price was born John Vincent Mulvihill on April 26th, 1917, in Easton, Pennsylvania, a small suburb of Philadelphia, and he was the son of Dr. Henry John Mulvihill and his wife Nell McElroy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Vincent earned a degree in English and French from La Salle University and later attended Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science, where he studied electrical engineering and met his wife, Joan, who was of Russian and Polish descent.

{"text": "Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation that covers many questions related to the relation between the structure of programs, or, more generally, algorithms and their execution. The focus here is on theoretical questions, such as how computable functions on natural numbers can be evaluated.\n\nThe term “natural” refers to the fact that many of these questions are difficult even to formulate. They are concerned with the existence or non-existence of computable functions, or computational problems that are decidable. The fundamental difference between decidable and non-decidable problems is that the former are decided using an Turing machine.\n\nThese computable functions, which are the main topic of interest, include some very simple and some quite complex functions that cannot be computed by any Turing machine. The Turing Machines are an important branch of computing as Turing's model of computation is considered to be the most popular and successful model ever to study computation. His aim was to establish the theory of computation from first principles. It is to be noted that computability and decidability are separate properties for a problem. A problem can be computable without any of its outcomes being decided, nor can it be decided without its outcomes being computable.\n\nMany computable problems have been discovered. Some of these functions are recursive, others are not. Examples of these functions include Factorial, Ackermann's function, the halting problem, the Halting Problem, the Church-Turing thesis, the Universal Turing Machine, the Turing Machine, the λ-calculus, the Turing Machine with one tape, and many others.\n\nThe history of computational complexity can be traced back to Turing's work on the halting problem, published in 1936. He introduced the concept of a Turing machine that he then used to establish the existence of the halting problem and its unsolvability.\n\nThe main research in computability theory has been centered at the Institute of Advanced Study, Princeton, in New Jersey, and at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. Recently, the theory has been adopted by a large number of mathematicians and computer scientists within the United States.\n\n“Turing machines are an important branch of computing as Turing's model of computation is considered to be the most popular and successful model ever to study computation. His aim was to establish the theory of computation from first principles.”\n\n“Turing's aim was to establish the theory of computation from first principles. However there are issues about the foundation of this theory. It has been questioned on two counts. The first is that he was too general with the axioms for the Turing machine. The second is that the proof he gave has not turned up a computational strategy or strategy proof.”\n\n“While they are similar in conception to the Turing machine, one is a model of computation while the other is a model of computation in the category of sets of natural numbers. This leads to quite divergent philosophies on both theory and computational practice.”\n\n“It may be that this view will be taken up. I also think it would be very useful to see the theory of computation in terms of the computable functions.”\n\n“The difference between decidability and computability is fundamental to computational theory. Decidability is a property of a problem while computability is a property of the solution to said problem. A solution can be computable without being decidable, and vice versa.”\n\n“For example, the halting problem is decidable, but a solution to the halting problem cannot always be proved.”\n\n“The halting problem is one of the main sources of problems in a computability theore. These are problems that have no solution, i.e., there exist no program that accepts all inputs and halts with a yes-answer decision.”\n\n“One of the main differences between computability and decidability is a key distinction between theorems and their proofs. A mathematical theorem is the proof of a hypothesis, this theorem establishes that this hypothesis is true. A proof is an argument that shows that a theorem, such as the Pigeonhole Principle for instance, is true. To prove that a theorem is true, the mathematician's proof, which would be the proof of contradiction, would be required to show that the statement's antecedent is false. The antecedent is the assumption preceding the theorem and would have to be false. Therefore the proof of a proof of a theorem is invalid and cannot be considered a valid mathematical argument. However a proof need not be valid. For example, the proof by contradiction, commonly known as the “proof by negation”, was not actually a valid mathematical argument. It is possible the negation of a claim in itself is false, thus negating the truth of said claim is also false, despite being a valid argument.”\n\n“Unlike the Turing machine, Gödel's incom", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "This movie was way over-hyped. A lot of the viewers, I feel, felt they were being forced to watch it, and that didn't sit well with me. The whole setup was really poorly done as well, but that's another story.The problem with the movie was that it was really hard to keep up with everything going on in the story line. The story was all over the place, confusing the audiences and making them feel dizzy because they were trying to figure everything out as well. The plot was interesting I suppose, and it added a lot of mystery but it could've been much better. Most of the special effects were pretty good, there were some that were good, like the one that showed the guy in the tank that was fighting (who I don't remember who he was), but most of the special effects were overdone and really unrealistic.I'm not going to go into what the whole story was all about, it would be pointless, since some people might still want to see this and I really doubt anyone would really understand it without the context of the story. But I want to comment on what I think about the movie as well, so that you can understand me a bit better.The whole premise, as I said before, was a bit confusing and there was way too much going on. To me, I felt like the movie should've gone the way they originally planned it. There were a few scenes, with some of the characters, that were well done for the most part and those were kind of the best scenes. What made it hard to keep up with everything was that there were three plots going on at the same time, and that was all very disjointed and confusing. I'm not very good at keeping up with the plots sometimes, especially when things are split up into three plots, but that's only my own opinion. One of the big problems was that it was not well made. You had to figure a ton of stuff out, and it wasn't fun. Most people know movies where they have to guess their way around and try to figure things out. That's basically what the movie did, so that was kinda the problem. I found it very hard to keep track of everything, since it was split of into three entirely different stories, and most of what they were doing didn't make sense at all.The big problem that I didn't like, was that it was so confusing, most of the audience couldn't follow it, they couldn't understand why some things were happening at a given time. It was hard to think about the movie because when things were all over the place and at different parts of the movie, and most of the characters were being introduced into the movie after the movie really started. It made me really angry sometimes, trying to keep up with the movie because I couldn't follow it, and that pissed me off. It didn't make sense. The movie was a little childish and I didn't like that.What made this movie a little childish, was that everything had a little bit of humor. It started off with little jokes and things like that, but slowly the jokes turned into too much and they became kind of cringy. I was kind of turned off by some of the humor and it was forced into me. The biggest example of this humor, was the whole thing with the girl who was playing at being the girl, the guy with the girl hat. It was so forced and weird that I wasn't into it at all. The way they made her look and act was pretty over the top and weird. He really had to try, just to convince people that it was a mask, but that wasn't funny at all. I found it uncomfortable just laughing. I thought at first that the mask would crack once the guy was done with it and let him take it off, but the movie was kind of weird and it never really happened. Overall I would give it a 6/10. It could've been more clear and understandable but some parts were still really good and really great. Just about everyone should go see it, you just have to watch your brain, that's all.I'm now going to tell you how I would rate the special effects of the movie. I'll go in order from worst to first best. Here they go:A. Tank at the beginningB. Tank near the end. It would have been great!C. Girl in a tank holding a knifeD. Movie credits. That didn't last long.E. Water under someone. Maybe not the worst, but definitely not the best.F. Kid in a room that was moving. Weird. G. Girl in a white room. Ummm..... Weird?H. Kid in a room with a little boy. Weird. I would have preferred to see her in a room with a boy who was the same age. I think it would have been better.If I had to rate this from a point from zero to a hundred, I would have said I would rate it a", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in Earth's atmosphere before its discovery. We learn that in the late 17th century, a Scottish physician named John Rowley noticed that humans could not breathe or exercise efficiently without fresh oxygen.\n\nThe doctor first attempted to persuade people of this fact by showing them the effects of inhaling gas with and without oxygen. He wanted to prove the fact that the human system needs oxygen to work properly. By doing this, Rowley discovered something that had probably been known or suspected for several centuries: that there is an oxygen-rich atmosphere in which mammals can live. But it was not until the next century that scientists isolated pure, crystalline oxygen gas and found that animals can't live without it.\n\nBy then, scientists knew that atmospheric air was usually only a trace component of our atmosphere. The rest of it exists in a mixture of the following gases: nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, inert gases such as argon and neon, and trace amounts of other gases. In the past few years, the use of air-filtering devices has helped to make breathing cleaner for people. But not all air pollution is due to dirty factories, automobile exhaust, or poor sanitation. We inhale air that has been processed, filtered, and reconditioned to remove many dangerous impurities. We even breathe it directly as an aid to rest from strenuous exercise. (If you've ever stayed in a hotel, a private hospital, a spa, a beauty parlor, or a similar place, you will have seen the constant hum of machines to recondition the air that is circulated through those very rooms. The same process can be used to purify air anywhere.)\n\nScientists have discovered that some of those harmful substances do much more than just make us ill when we breathe them. Some poisons have very serious effects even if the body is exposed to them for only short periods of time—too short to cause permanent harm. But a few poisons have other health effects that are important to monitor or to avoid. When we are exposed to a poisonous substance, we may develop headaches or have a weak or shaking hand, but not all exposure to poisons produces serious consequences.\n\n**_The toxic substances in human air are as great an impediment to health as water and other common substances of life are to health._**\n\n**RANDOLPH D. MARSHALL**\n\n_\"We must realize that modern air pollution is a threat to the health not only of the millions who breathe polluted air in cities, but also of the many who, for the sake of clean living, must limit their outdoor activities to brief periods.\"_\n\n**J. ROTHENBACH, EDITOR, _HEALTH AND SAFETY_, VOL. 40, NO. 1, JANUARY 1949**\n\nIn **Part 1** and **Part 2** you will learn about common toxins in the environment and how to prevent health problems. You will learn about how to protect yourself against chemical poisons and how to get help if you're poisoned or experience an emergency medical condition.\n**2**\n\n**A LARM MIXTURE**\n\n**W** hen an animal or a human's skin comes in contact with a poisonous substance for its first time, there is usually no response. This lack of a reaction to the toxin is because no mechanism to detect or block this toxin has evolved in the body. However, if a toxic substance is inhaled into the body, a specific system designed to protect the body against this kind of damage is stimulated to action.\n\nEach of the organs that are part of the **blood** - **brain** communication system receives a chemical signal that warns it to react and respond when a poisonous substance contacts its tissue or membranes. This system consists of four parts:\n\n**1.** The nose, which sends a signal to one of the special parts of the brain, called the **limbic system**, telling it to react to **volatile** toxins in the air.\n\n**2.** The **lumbar nervous system**, which provides special protection in the abdomen and kidneys.\n\n**3.** The special protective systems in the mouth and eyes.\n\n**4.** The parts of the body responsible for excreting hazardous toxins.\n\nThese four systems are important to know about, because we must know how they work in ourselves so that we can make healthy decisions.\n\n**A. The Nose**\n\nThe nose is designed to detect the presence and quantity of certain kinds of substances in the air. Certain animals have special cells that recognize and process these gases in a similar way:\n\n**1.** When a foreign gas or an **odor** that has been associated with the harmful substance enters the body through a broken nose or by inhaling the wrong concentration, there is a **toxic response**. This toxic response stimulates the production of hormones", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "A photo of Marcel Zech's tattoo was taken at a small town on the coast of the Adriatic (where he lives most of year).\n\nMarcel is 55, he lives in a village, Zemunik - south from Rijeka. There he lives almost all year. He works as a painter in Rijeka. He has been interested in body art since his childhood, when he was a student at the high school in Rijeka.\n\nMarcel is not in the best of shape at the moment: he has been on vacation recently, and it seems as if the last few days of this month were not good days to him (travelling with friends - they rented their car but did not have a car at home, and had not a possibility to go to the other side of Montenegro because there was no car to rent where they are now).\n\nHe says that this has been a bad year for him regarding his health, and the beginning of his retirement: his last working contract had come to an end, he was retired officially from the last big project - this was a big ship, and he had done the finishing in the yard in Rijeka, but now he is on a voluntary basis for this job, and without pay.\n\nBut I am very curious about his tattoos, and I asked him for the name:\n\nThey are very beautiful and strange, because he did them one by one, bit by bit. When he got out of body, one is the tattoo in the photo. They show his inner world, his \"moods\", his memories of past events. At the moment they are mostly full with black, blue and red. I asked him to tell a bit about his process of getting to the present pictures, and he says:\n\nI always had this idea about the tattoo. But it was really expensive. So I had always to make compromises. So, I thought - maybe I should get a tattoo when he is almost dead. I could afford to get a single one - and it seemed to be a very good idea. I had always to accept that when the body is gone, it's the spirit that is permanent. I could get the tattoo even when I am alive, but I will no longer be able to paint. What is left after death is this: no more painting, no more creation, no more body.\n\nSo I was afraid I would not be able to create a soul after my death. What would happen to a soul if it has no body?\n\nI started in July this year. On the first day I started with a simple cross, black and blue. It was the best. Then I continued. I started from my right foot, so that there would be a sequence on the right, and there was my sister on the other side of my body. That was two weeks and at those times I was still capable of drawing.\n\nThen I have come to the left cheek, and another small painting with the same technique of black and blue. These two paintings are my \"likes\" for this tattoo, and that's where he got the black and blues from. I was so pleased. Even if he did not ask for colors...\n\nI never imagined that this color combination would stay. So I got four reds of the same coloration. It would be very beautiful on the right, but I did not have the courage to do that because there was so much to do there. I made a few sketches, but I did not get all of them. I started at the lower eyelid, and I drew very small. But when I was finished, they are very big.\n\nThis tattoo would be in a very large panel between the legs, and then I wanted the lower part of the legs to be black as well, and that was when I first tried to get the black. I was able to create in one piece, so I only had to draw a stroke between the black and the red. But that did not work. So I was almost finished with this, but then I was afraid that they would be no borders. So then I tried to add more, and in addition I added a black dot between his feet and the bottom. I realized that I would not be able to finish the whole work of this tattoo. This, then, was from four to five weeks.\n\nThen I tried to finish it in one day. I think I was successful in drawing a large cross over the left leg, the first time that I thought it would be possible. From there I thought maybe, if I paint something around it, it would not be visible.\n\nAnd then, at the upper right thigh, there was a red line that went to the back. The left thigh was drawn from the belly upwards to the knee, as well as the calf to be inked upwards so that it would be black as well.\n\nThen, one day, I thought", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "the aim was to investigate the immunoreactivities for nos enzymes (nerve growth factor and synaptosomal associated protein 25) in the neuropil of the human substantia nigra and compare these results with those in the rat. For immunohistochemistry, cryostat sections of the human substantia nigra were used. Immunostaining was performed applying antisera against alpha-synuclein, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, gamma-synuclein, vesicular monoamine transporter 3 and dopamine active transporter. Anti-alpha-synuclein immunostaining revealed a strong immunolabeling in neuropil of the substantia nigra pars reticulata, while less intense alpha-synuclein immunostaining was observed in the pars compacta. Anti-ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 staining was only seen in the rat brain, the strongest staining being in the striatum. Anti-gamma-synuclein immunostaining was only observed in the rat brain, the strongest immunostaining being in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Anti-vesicular monoamine transporters 3 and dopamine-active transporter immunostainings revealed no reaction in the human and rat substantia nigra, indicating the specificity of these antisera. The human substantia nigra shows selective immunostaining for different components of the Lewy bodies. Since human and animal samples were compared by using the same antisera and procedures, an immunoreactivity for alpha-synuclein was detected in the human brain. The immunoreactivity for other Lewy body components such as ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, gamma-synuclein and vesicular monoamine transporters 3 remains to be determined in the human substantia nigra.", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Speaking in front of an audience even came out higher in the polls during the first Republican primary season when former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said it. He lost that campaign but, according to many who spoke Wednesday at the White House, Mr. Gingrich has learned a lot from his loss.\n\n“Gingrich is one of the most entertaining and one of the best speakers that anybody has seen in many a long time. We think that there is a real opportunity to bring him back,” said former Sen. Fred Thompson, who was a guest of Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nMr. Thompson and his running-mate, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, say they hope to give the voters of Iowa the chance to get to know Mr. Gingrich and decide for themselves, even if it’s in the name of vetting someone who knows what it takes to run a presidential campaign.\n\n“We’re not trying to be the ultimate party choice,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Our goal is to have fun, do something for a couple of weeks, to get as big a crowd as we can and have a good time doing it.”\n\nThe Republican National Committee is also concerned that the current field is too divisive. Committee Chairman Ed Rollins said it’s important that all the candidates be able to appeal to a broad range of voters.\n\n“We don’t want to leave any part of the country out,” he said. “We want to get rid of these extremes at the end. We need to bring people together.”\n\nHe said the committee is looking for more moderates but isn’t interested in adding “any ideological positions” to the ticket, either. Instead, he said, the Republicans will “put the country first, not our own particular, narrow-interest agenda.”\n\nThe GOP field is getting narrower, and so are the poll standings. But the GOP is struggling with a major issue: the presidential primary calendar. The candidates need two things. First, they need to have name recognition. They can’t get that through an Iowa straw poll. It’s a long-shot that the eventual nominee gets much voter support that way. Second, they need to come to a consensus on selecting a candidate who can beat President Bush.\n\nThe question, according to GOP voters in the room, is how the candidates will address each of these issues. And how much of a priority is that in the minds of the party bosses.\n\n“It’s very serious. I think we all know who’s going to be the nominee. But the other candidates need to decide where they want to be in three months, four months, six months,” said John DeCamp, the former director of President George W. Bush’s Hispanic outreach. “All the Republicans need to be focused on the country.”\n\nMr. DeCamp said he didn’t know much about any of the candidates. But he made it a point to show a photo of himself with Mr. Bush and to say he wanted “a ticket in this general election that can help the next president.”\n\nAnd if that means having a Republican president be the one to select Mr. Gingrich rather than anoint him himself, so be it.\n\n“Let him be president all right. Let him be president for four years. He certainly has a way of talking about this country and about America that would make him an excellent president, but he cannot run for president from a House office,” said Tom Keady, a former member of Congress from Pennsylvania who served with Mr. Gingrich.\n\nOther participants, like Rep. Dan Lungren, a California Republican, disagreed.\n\n“I will be there to support and help this man because I know I can make a contribution. There are thousands of us who know how to do this and we’re very comfortable in the arena of change. We’ve been in that arena in our state. We’ve been through elections before, and we know the process,” he said. “In every election people are surprised by a guy like Gingrich. He always seems to take the nation by surprise. We need more of that.”\n\nOther topics:\n\n— Mr. Lungren said that some people just want to run for president in order to have a better chance of winning. He didn’t have any advice for the candidates, but he did make it a point to remind people that, “this is about the White House, not about Iowa.”\n\n“We’ve got another election in California, and if the California winner runs, there’s not going to be an Iowa winner,” he said.\n\nFor his own part, Mr. Giuliani said he", "label": "gptj"}

According to latest figures released by the HSE the death toll is at 10 with over 70 people injured.\n\nThis year’s storm and tidal surge has seen more Irish casualties than the last five years combined. Although the public have been told not to evacuate due to danger from rising sea waters, many who have been affected have decided to leave their homes. One woman from Dublin has now been staying in a hotel for a month and her family, which left their house last week, have had to stay with relatives.\n\nAn Irish Red Cross mobile unit, which moved into a second tent at Traigh Mhor beach in Ballycahane, Co.

If you’re not prepared for that kind of thing you will need support,” the woman, who did not want to be named, said.\n\nThe deaths took place as one woman was evacuated by helicopter from her home in Dundalk, County Louth – one of several residents who decided to leave their homes for hotel accommodation this weekend. She was taken to Dundalk Hospital as a precaution.\n\nOther reports of people being evacuated from homes include one person in the Sligo area south of the city and one person was evacuated from Clogherhead, Co. Louth.\n\nThe number of people who have evacuated their homes have come to 11 this weekend with another five people who have been living in tents at Traigh Mhor, the townland at the tip of the island which has become a national focal post for emergency services. As well as one mobile centre at a field near the beach where people can access shelter, the Irish Red Cross has set up a second unit in Traigh Mhor, where it is providing a safe place for people with a lack of accommodation and other services.\n\nIrish Red Cross\n\nThe first unit moved in on Saturday, opening its doors on Sunday, providing a place for over a dozen people to stay and get emergency services.\n\n“It is nice to be able to provide help here and get a break from the normal life which people just have to keep going,” said Helen Furlong, who had been with the red cross since 2000. “We need to keep these people safe from the worst, and from the damage to their houses and cars, and then they can relax and focus on the other things.”\n\nDespite the dangers of the Atlantic, the death toll in this year’s storms has become a reality after five years of almost no real incident.\n\nThe first storm, which caused floods, occurred in February 2013 and has led to some of the worst flooding in Ireland ever.\n\nIn the five years before the latest disaster, from 2011 to 2015, there have been just two serious incidents – one of them an Irish Navy rescue helicopter which landed on the island in 2013, in which two crew and two passengers have since died.\n\nThere was also a ferry that was hit by a storm that same year that year that was carrying about 140 people, leading to several injuries and one fatality.\n\nThe number of people evacuated and their destinations during this weekend’s storms have now risen to 11. These include two people who were being evacuated by helicopter from Dundalk.\n\nTwo emergency services officials, who were working off the island, also had to be evacuated on Saturday afternoon when they found the roof of the mobile operation unit had been torn off and there were large chunks of tin missing.\n\nThe Dublin woman staying in Dublin because she does not have accommodation, was at home alone with her two daughters at the time of the tornado and the water flooded their house.\n\nWhen the water started to flood their house she and one of her daughters were able to get out through the back door of the house. When the water did come into the house the other daughter was in the upstairs bedroom and the mother and daughter were able to get into the top floor of a house in the neighbour’s garden where the mother was able to contact an emergency service. She was taken to the hospital for a precautionary check-up.\n\nA garda spokesman said when emergency services are on the ground there will always be the potential for danger. “People need to be aware that emergency services will treat any incident on water safety first in order to protect vulnerable groups such as the elderly, pregnant women and children.”\n\nThe spokeswoman said that no one should be forced out of their homes and that anyone being forced to abandon their home must be provided with", "label": "gptj"}

Although it has not been used for background subtraction before, its presence can be easily taken into account\n\n-   the fact that the proton and electron spectra may be taken from measurements with a constant energy per proton/electron and different energy per electron.\n\n-   the difference in the average spectra for the soft x-ray and $\\gamma$-ray background. This difference between the two radiation fields can be taken into account by setting different parameters for the electron-ion cross section and the photon-ion cross section. When the electron-proton cross section is energy independent, a good approximation to the high energy part of the energy spectrum is the $2-3.9$Mev range while for the photon part a similar range is optimal.\n\n-   the possibility of a galactic cosmic ray contribution that may be considered as a diffuse soft x-ray, a $\\gamma$- ray and a hard x- ray background that can be subtracted.\n\nThe spectra we have obtained are dependent on the assumptions we have used.

{"text": "I saw this movie in the theater, and was thoroughly entertained. It is a very simple plot--we have a young couple moving from one apartment to another, and then back, and finally we join them where we left them on the first level.\n\nThe second time I saw it, however, it was on television. And this time I actually had a chance to write the comments on the television, instead of leaving it as an afterthought.\n\nA few observations:\n\n1) If you are going to write a movie, don't leave out any clues and expect people to come up with your own ideas.\n\nHere is one clue--the boy is very tall. And he has the same coloring and same build as a man who lived there before the boy's mother was killed. The old man never mentioned it because he didn't recognize the boy when he saw him at an adult book store.\n\n2) The first time I saw the movie I was struck by the fact that there must be at least one old book out there which contains the names of all the old people depicted in the film. Since the director took the time to give us these names (who are all dead by the time they are \"appearing\" on the television), and since he was writing the book at the same time, he could also write the names of the characters in it.\n\nThe director has the old boy mention that he had been an editor of a book which the boy has been reading--this was not a clue, but it shows why it was probably necessary to make sure to have at least one character whose name was in the public literature--the editor's name should have been in the book.\n\nThis should not have been a puzzle to anyone, but it was.\n\n3) The book the boy is reading is called \"How to Get Along with Others,\" by William A. Ward. It's a book which has now been out of print for 40 or 50 years--so the boy doesn't just happen to know the author's name offhand.\n\nThe author was the only one who mentioned this name. He did so because he is one of the names on the title page of the book. The book which the boy is reading is not out of print.\n\nOf course the author is fictional--everybody's fiction is different, but his name is in fact fictional. And the book exists! In other words, a number of movies were filmed over the years which were very similar to the movie \"How to Get Along With Others.\"\n\nAnd when you're writing an article on movies written about real people, you can expect a few things to begin to be puzzling: for example, the book the author mentions as his own might not actually be out of print today. In other words, the fact he says it was \"out of print\" may simply be true today, but was not true years ago. Maybe the author's book was available in some form a very long time ago, but if the real author was writing about his own book then he would realize he was giving a clue which might actually be misleading.\n\n4) The plot: As the real world goes, if a young man and a young woman don't have a baby after they have been together for a while, and if they later want to get together again, they have no problem. They can go, and do it--for an example, the couple that had been in \"A Walk in the Springtime\"--the girl is in college where the boy is still in high school.\n\nThe boy never once mentions that she is older than he is (at least, not after she first mentioned her name), even at the end, where the boy says he liked looking at her. The only way the boy might have known about her age is if she'd mentioned it in some other context in the movie, and then he would then have understood she was older than him and would have understood what he was talking about. Which would have been a little bit difficult, considering he says \"but she was young.\"\n\nThe movie \"Little Men\" was written back in 1956--and by the end of the movie the boy is now in college and has just graduated, and the girl is married and has a grown-up child. The movie says there is another child (the girl's) somewhere. So what's the deal?\n\nI got myself into this one!\n\nHow do you suppose the girl was going to take the news of another child? (I mean it in a nice way.) By the end of the movie she's got a grown-up child! You don't expect people to just accept what the hero says!\n\nIt occurs to me that \"The Return of Frank James\" is a classic example of writing done to fill pages--or pages and pages and pages. It's very clever and very good writing, but, because it does not take up the time of the", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "The crisis reduced the demand for large cars. Japanese imports, once a mainstay of the domestic market, became nearly extinct. Instead, they joined the ranks of outmoded and unwanted cars in the U.S. scrap heaps.\n\nBy the end of the decade, even big sedans were scarce. The last of the Big Three, General Motors, had only one new car named the Caprice. It looked like a Lincoln Continental. A Lincoln Continental!\n\nIt seemed to be the answer to the decade of the 1970s; a large, American car that could out-big-big itself. It looked like a larger version of the Ford Torino, and drove like a big car. It was built by a large company that prided itself on building huge cars. But not only would the Caprice never sell enough to stay in production, it became such an embarrassment to Lincoln, a brand with very little else, that they decided to discontinue it in 1976.\n\nIn 1978, Ford bought Chrysler outright. One might think that a company that big would make big cars, and instead the two biggest U.S. car companies went from selling 60% of all cars to selling 55% of all cars. Both had shrunk massively. To some, this seemed odd. The two major American car companies seemed to have lost their collective mojo. And indeed, they had.\n\nBut they were not alone. The American car industry, in the late 1970’s and in the 1980’s, was afflicted by a similar issue: the need for a “new American car” to restore the industry’s confidence. This is what the American car was supposed to be. And this is what happened.\n\nBy the mid-1970’s the Chevrolet Vega was an anachronism. It had started as Ford’s little people car but quickly became the butt of jokes. Its tiny engine and little payload were, apparently, the source of its bad reputation. It became one of America’s last gas-burners.\n\nChevrolet also started selling a “Chevelle” to replace its Chevette. It was built on a unibody frame, so it was much simpler to build than a conventional car and it was sold to many more buyers. But once again, the problem was the car itself.\n\nThe Chevelle was a disaster, and GM recalled the cars with itchy fingers.\n\nFor its part, Ford was trying to push the Mustang, and it seemed to be selling, but just selling. It became the best-selling car in America that year. But it also looked a little strange — almost like the new European cars, and not like a big, American car. Like the Vega and the Chevelle, something needed to give.\n\nIt could not be the Mustang… it was American. What about a smaller car, like a Camaro? And, if it was a small car, it should be as small as people, like the Vega and the Chevelle. So it was decided that the next American car would be “the small car” with the small engine: the Camaro.\n\nIt would be big. It would be great. It would be the Chevrolet Camaro… and all the cars would be built on the same “pinnacle” unibody like the Chevelle.\n\nFord and GM, desperate for cash, were willing to bet the farm on this idea. By 1981 they had finally stopped building cars that they could name, and started building cars with numbers — the Chevy Citation and the Ford Bronco II. They called them the F-150 and the Bronco II, as if they were supposed to be big.\n\nIt didn’t exactly work. The numbers were just numbers on a sheet of paper. No one really cared. The buyers were looking for something familiar — a car with a name. The cars were so big and lumbering that nobody really believed they “got it.” The buyers walked away from the dealerships with the Camaro and never bought another Chevy car.\n\nWhen the car itself was recalled in 1989, it had become the poster-car for the Big Three’s need to build big American cars.\n\nMeanwhile, other car companies, including Mercedes and Jaguar, were producing cars like Mercedes’ 300CE and Jaguars’ E-Type, cars you’d see in Germany or England. These were not big cars.\n\nEven with the numbers, buyers still wanted a big car in America. Ford and GM built a new, big car in 1991. It was a new nameplate — the Mustang. It was larger than it had been since the Edsel. It was bigger and more luxurious, but they called it the Mustang the way they called trucks “Hummer” and boats “Polaris.” This, too, didn", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "In many poor and developing countries much land and housing is owned with the owner's family or other members of their household. When the family member has died this makes the management of these properties that are of immense importance. In Uganda there are over a million of these family owned properties with around half of them lacking a properly defined management plan. This study was carried out to assess the importance of the owner's knowledge of their property's management requirements to the sustainability and development of their land.\n\nMaterials and methods {#sec1}\n=====================\n\nThis study was carried out between July 2015 and August 2016 at Masaka, Kanungu and Mubende districts of Uganda. Masaka district lies 50 kilometres south of Kampala in Central Uganda and Kanungu district is in the South Western part. Mubende district is located in the centre of Eastern Uganda and borders with Tanzania.\n\nPrior to this study, the survey team carried out a detailed mapping of each district as well as local government administration to prepare for data collection. The study population consisted of all the family and household heads who had their property within the district. An information meeting on a general topic related to property management was held in each district to explain the study to the owners. The study team included eight trained surveyors who visited each house-hold that had a property or land. The study team asked the heads whether they had a property management plan (PMP). If the answer was given \"no\" or the respondent did not answer this question the interviewer proceeded with the rest of the questions on demographics, ownership of the property and tenure, PMPs, and the owner-manager's role. The interviewers used a questionnaire that was created for the study. Questionnaires were translated from English into the local language and pre-tested among people owning properties with very similar characteristics. In each household the study team interviewed the head of the household. During the main survey interviews, we sought clarifications from interviewees if needed. The interviews were carried in privacy with the assistance of a translator. The owners, mainly heads of household, were contacted when necessary to clarify questions. The interviewers sought clarifications when an owner gave an ambiguous answer that may have needed interpreting.\n\nThe ownership of land refers to the right to use, own, own and dispose, of land or an area within a district. In this study we use the definition of land developed by [@bib11], that is, the physical part of the land used for human activities; as well as the part that is under the control of a person. Also within this definition there are no restrictions on the term property. A property refers to any land or building that can be owned, whether private or public, but excludes national (owned or used state assets).\n\nProprietors in this study include the owners and the managers, which are usually the heads of the family, while the manager may have different roles within different families. For example, a manager might be the first to use the land and has the responsibility of keeping the land in a condition good for its use. Another could be a responsible farm employee who looks after and cultivates the land.\n\nAfter the completion of the interview, study forms were left at the premises in order to be completed later if required, in the same way the participants were reminded via text messages, telephone calls and/or visits. This was done to encourage the participants to come back with the information sheets that were left at the property.\n\nIn each district we used a probability proportionate to size sampling method to choose three districts. We also did a random selection of three communities within the chosen study districts. This ensured a distribution across the districts and different levels of government areas; therefore giving a sample from rural, peri urban and urban settings.\n\nData management and analysis {#sec1.1}\n----------------------------\n\nData entry was done using EpiData version 3.1 and cleaned and exported to STATA version 12. Descriptive socio- demographics for age, sex, socio-economic class, and ownership of the property were explored. Furthermore, the ownership was disaggregated into land ownership and housing ownership. In most settings ownership of the property could be disaggregated into the following categories: public, private and family and households. In this study the ownership of the land was disaggregated into private and family and households.\n\nData quality was maintained by checking for completeness and entered, cleaned and exported to STATA version 12 for analysis. Univariate and Multivariate logistic and linear regression tests were applied to explore the significant factors associated with ownership of PMP.\n\nThe study was approved by the National Council for Science and Technology in Uganda, and the Makerere University School of Public Health Higher Degrees Research and Ethics Committee.\n\nResults {#sec2}\n=======\n\nThe study population consisted of all the family and household heads who had their properties with the district.

{"text": "Private schools in Australia may be favoured for many reasons: more personal attention from their teachers, smaller class sizes, superior academic support and a wide range of extra-curricular activities. However, they face many hurdles for being financially self-sufficient. Not only do they need to pay for the tuition costs, they also incur additional costs like uniforms, school fees, transport and lunches.\n\nIt’s true that private schools still make a great investment in children’s social and educational development. However, you can cut the costs involved with a private school education right now if you know where you can invest, how much you can save, and the right timing.\n\nFind out more in the following article.\n\nHow to Get the Best Value for Your Money from Your Private School\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the right high school, choosing one that can teach your child the things they’ll need for an impressive career in the future will mean the best value and long term savings. If you believe that a private school can provide your child with all of this and you still want the best value for your money, there are certain tactics you can take.\n\nThe best way to do this is to identify your priorities and then look for the best private high school. Here is how to choose the best public high school:\n\nWhat do you want your child to learn?\n\nThe first thing you need to do when choosing a high school is determine what kind of education you want for your child, as it plays a huge part in the final result. If your child wants to make a career in medicine you, for example, it can’t be a bad idea to go to the best med school. This can also vary from person to person and location to location because of various reasons.\n\nIf you work with a private school and it specializes in a field of study, like education, computer science, music and so on, then you will most likely be investing money into their courses such as technology, English, and other general education topics. This often creates more demand when hiring graduates for the kind of jobs you’re looking for.\n\nFind an appropriate private high school\n\nFinding a great school can be a tedious job, but there are ways to make it easier. Many private high schools have websites and often students can compare each school online to see where each school measures up. A really good website to help with this comparison is School Choice, a site dedicated to helping students, families and schools navigate the education system safely and effectively. You can also find schools yourself by visiting your local Department of Education website.\n\nIt’s also a good idea to talk to other parents who are choosing private high schools and use their knowledge to help you make an informed decision.\n\nHow Much Will You Save?\n\nOnce you’ve decided what type of education you’re interested in, you’re going to have to factor into the decision whether to invest in a private high school or public school. When it comes to the choice between public and private high school, the choice should come down to affordability.\n\nThe price of a private school education has risen throughout history. However, it is important not to assume that you’ll save more money with a private high school simply because you need to invest more financially for the same amount of time.\n\nIf your child enters school at the primary or secondary level they’re usually eligible to apply for an Australian School Uniform Scholarship. However, the Scholarship doesn’t always help you save the most money.\n\nThe number of school uniforms can often vary for public and private. For example, private schools will often provide their students with uniforms. On the other hand, there can be times when private schools cannot afford these uniforms, so this can contribute to a higher cost.\n\nWhat are the different types of Private High Schools?\n\nThere are many different types of private high schools:\n\n• Co-educational – Co-educational schools are just that, they have both boys and girls in the school. They may offer a mixed-gender program but they have separate buildings for students of both sexes and they may also have the option to separate to individual campuses for single gendered or all-male or all-female schools.\n\n• Girls-only – This is where boys are not permitted inside or it’s for all girls and it costs more, typically. They have separate buildings, separate staff and different curriculum. Girls only schools should be preferred over co-ed schools if you value the female role model. However private high schools may be more expensive than public schools.\n\n• Preschools – When it comes to private high schools the pre-schooling stage can take a number of different forms. It’s an age that is not regulated anywhere in the world, but it is also regarded as a “pre-K” period usually in elementary", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "purpose of this study was to evaluate the lymphocyte populations in normal, uninflamed, and inflamed gingiva as well as in serum samples from periodontitis patients. Gingival biopsies from patients with and without periodontitis and from gingivitis patients were prepared and stained by the immunohistochemical (IHC) method. In a subgroup of six periodontally healthy and six diseased subjects, serum samples were taken and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated. A polyclonal human immunoglobulin antibody (HCA2A-D) was used to detect CD1a+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD56+ cells in gingival and serum samples. CD2 was found on PBMC of all patients. On the gingival sample, CD56+ and CD2+ cells were found equally in the basal cell layer and on the connective tissue, while CD19+ and CD4+ cells were more common in the basal cell layer. In the serum samples, CD56+ and CD2+ cells were found equally in the basal cells, while CD4+ and CD8+ cells were not found, except for the gingivitis group. The main difference in gingival tissue between healthy and diseased gingival conditions was a decrease in the number of CD4+ and CD56+ cells in tissues from periodontitis patients. In gingival tissue, lymphocytes have specific distributions, where CD4+ cells were found more often than CD8+ cells. In serum samples from both patients and controls, CD56+ cells could be found in the basal cell layer of gingival tissue. There was no significant difference between the distribution of these cells in serum samples from periodontitis patients, periodontal healthy patients, or periodontitis patients in remission.", "label": "gptj"}

The system's biggest draw was the character selection--the 16 new and exclusive characters available just for the Wii U, with eight of those being Smash Bros. characters, was amazing.\n\nBut those same 16 characters weren't exactly a mass-market hit. Only 9.1 million Nintendo 3DSes (not counting the New 3DS XL) were sold by the end of March, which is a low number even accounting for the system's increased production output. In addition, it was far from the most successful video game console launch on the market in 2013.\n\n2013: Playstation 4 and Xbox One (PS4, XboxOne)\n\nLaunch Date: November 22\n\nLaunch Date: November 22 Availability: 3DS XL, Playstation 3 and 4, Xbox 360, Playstation 2, Xbox,\n\n3DS XL, Playstation 3 and 4, Xbox 360, Playstation 2, Xbox, Worldwide Sales: 24.9M (PS4), 12.3M (Xbox One)\n\n24.9M (PS4), 12.3M (Xbox One) Sold By: 11.4M (PS4), 4.4M (Xbox One)\n\n11.4M (PS4), 4.4M (Xbox One) Sold By: 24.3M (PS4), 5.5M (Xbox One)\n\nTo put things in perspective, the Wii U sold 12.3 million units by its first Christmas, but 12.9 million were sold by the end of February in 2014. That's because it actually launched on November 30, and its sales only spiked at the end of that month.\n\nOn the whole, 2013 was a good year for Microsoft and Sony. The Xbox One was a new console in a generation that lacked a true sequel, and Sony's successful PlayStation 4 was the perfect successor to Sony's old PlayStation 2 -- especially after the 3DS started losing share in the handheld space.\n\nThe PS4 and its motion-controller-aided games like Uncharted, Far Cry 4, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Killzone, and more were so much better than the Wii U's motion controls and Wii games.\n\nThis is not to say that the Wii U was a bad console. Far from it. Nintendo's new console offered excellent games, and it had great, innovative ideas like playing Link to the Past with a GameCube adapter. However, 2013 was the year that Sony and Microsoft finally took the games console market seriously--and both Nintendo and Sony are still in the fight.\n\n2014: WiiU (WiiU)\n\nLaunch Date: February 28\n\nLaunch Date: February 28 Availability: 2DS, Wii U, Playstation 3, Playstation Vita, Xbox 360, XboxOne\n\n2DS, Wii U, Playstation 3, Playstation Vita, Xbox 360, XboxOne Worldwide Sales: 10.4M (WiiU)\n\nThe Wii U was a success by any standards, and Nintendo's New 3DS XL handheld was also a success. Nintendo wasn't even expecting half as many sales as it got--the 2DS had a much better reputation pre-launch, so the \"Wii U-like\" name might have hurt pre-launch. At any rate, the console sold 6.9 million units in a year that wasn't as great for Nintendo as the year before.\n\n2015: PS4 and Xbox One\n\nLaunch Date: December 10\n\nLaunch Date: December 10 Availability: 3DS XL, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Playstation 4, Vita\n\n3DS XL, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Vita, Wii U, Xbox One, Playstation 4, Vita Worldwide Sales: 21M (PS4), 12.2M (Xbox One)\n\nWhen the PS4 came out a year ago, it was the first console since the Xbox 360 and the first console in a generation. When the Xbox One was announced, it was already the successor; but when it finally launched, the PS4 easily took the next generation's best console in every respect. The Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 sold over 20 million units worldwide, and at the time of this writing, the sales have yet to stop.\n\nThat same year (2013), the 360 and the PS3 finally turned 10.

{"text": "Its 480-page summary details the treatment meted out to some 300,000 mostly Muslim detainees held in American prisons and interrogation centers around the world.\n\nThe investigation began immediately after the 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by al-Qaeda in 2001, and it took into account testimony from hundreds of detainees, from FBI agents, psychologists, and other interrogators.\n\nThe New York Times, one of the paper’s former editors and now the lead investigative journalist on the report, said his review of more than 2,500 documents, interviews with top interrogators and the former chairman of a secretive intelligence advisory board made up of senior officials revealed a brutal program of interrogation techniques approved by three then-head of the CIA, David C. Hayden (now President Obama’s director of the National Counterterrorism Center), Jose Rodriguez and George W. Bush’s former deputy national security adviser, Michael J. Gerson.\n\nThough it has been alleged in the past that the US government is involved in numerous unlawful detention centers globally, including in Afghanistan, Yemen and Pakistan, the report details some of the first-hand accounts of the treatment US prisoners across the Middle East, Asia and Africa received at its custody.\n\nThe report includes allegations of beatings, sleep deprivation, forced nudity, prolonged isolation, extreme temperature, solitary confinement and stress positions. The list goes on and on and on.\n\nThe list also includes some specific dates, like 10/22/2001, which is when the infamous CIA black site rendition flight that included CIA torturer and chief of interrogations, Ali Soufan was flown to Romania.\n\nThe most obvious question: is any official responsible for these egregious abuses? Will American taxpayers be held accountable for years of torture.\n\n“This report is the most compelling evidence to date of the CIA’s use of coercive interrogation against detainees,” said Chris Anders, the deputy director of National Security Programs at the ACLU (Americans United for Liberties) and a co-author of the report.\n\nThe ACLU said the report reveals “a dark history of detention and interrogation practices that have only come to light as more public attention has been paid to the CIA in connection to the abuse of other prisoners like Jose Padilla and Abu Zubaida.” “This torture program was a stain on the national honor that was covered up, but must never be allowed to happen again,” said Jay S. Bybee, former associate deputy attorney general and a member of the legal advice group that designed the interrogation tactics.\n\nThe report further states that the program was never reviewed by a judge, had no internal oversight within the CIA, and there seems to be a great disconnect between former CIA leaders and current policy makers.\n\n“We have identified a pattern of misconduct and bad judgment that makes clear the need for a serious criminal investigation,” said Phillip Nash, a senior investigative fellow in the Project on Government Oversight at the Cato Institute and an adviser to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\n\nAccording to Nash and the report, CIA employees who questioned the harsh interrogation program’s legality were ignored and ostracized and even the report’s co-author, former ACLU official, Jay Bykom has received death threats and bomb threats.\n\nThe report also details how the Justice Department and then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzalez misled Congress and hid some of the information on the interrogation programs.\n\n“The report documents the CIA’s extensive efforts to prevent detainees from obtaining habeas corpus relief, with the DOJ and White House both involved in the misrepresentations,” said Mark Doss, a spokesperson for the ACLU.\n\nEven now, five years after the report’s initial release, Bush and Dick Cheney are still protecting the agency responsible for those abuses from public accountability.\n\n“It is an outrage,” added Nash, that the Bush-era Justice Department and the White House continue to prevent the public from knowing about the interrogation programs.” At a time when we should be doing everything we can to prevent another attack, we’re stuck in a bureaucratic morass in which only the top of the administration knows what really happened.”\n\nIn fact, the ACLU now finds itself in an even worse situation as Attorney General Eric Holder has gone to court to defend the CIA’s secret prisons. So, one might ask where does this investigation’s findings of torture programs stand among the legal process of the Justice Department?\n\nHere’s where it stands according to the New York Times:\n\nBy early 2010, lawyers at the Justice Department said that the CIA was violating the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by subjecting a detainee to treatment that amounted to simulated drowning and slammed his head against a wall, according to a classified 2010 internal Justice Department memorandum. This was despite a previous conclusion by the Justice Department in 2005 that the techniques were not illegal, the", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "AFC Wimbledon's win at Oxford earlier in the day saw them close to the halfway point of their maiden league campaign.\n\nThey head to MK Dons for a televised match next Saturday lunchtime, and it's a game they need to win to ensure the end of the season is more fruitful than the start.\n\nWimbledon will not be denied despite a few injury niggles. However, they know from their own experiences from last season, they are far from complete.\n\nIf Wimbledon do fail to win at Dons, they have to be worried that they can no longer rely on the players who guided them through last season's FA Cup success and promotion.\n\nIf they slip up here, it could spell the end of the road for manager Platt – and any hopes of getting back into the play offs for the first time in 26 years.\n\nBENSON GOALKEEPER'S PLANS\n\nBenson has been given every chance. Injuries have disrupted his first season at Wimbledon, with a calf injury ending his season early, but he hasn't let the club down. His penalty save from O’Brien showed his composure in front of goal, and he has not lost his cool.\n\nThe 23-year-old had only played one other top flight game after signing from Southend this summer – against Wigan away in August. It was his only chance of exposure to the intensity of league football.\n\n“Football isn't easy,” said Benson. \"I've seen that before. Every week there are ups and downs.\n\n“I've got a couple of more opportunities this season to improve, but I'm not thinking about that.\n\n“I just want to enjoy playing and make as many errors as I possibly can and learn as much as I can to protect the team and hopefully we can go on and get some success this season.”\n\nHe has been one of Wimbledon's most consistent and in parts outstanding performers so far this season, making 16 saves on his Premier League debut and another 13 as his side fell behind at the Harringay Stadium.\n\nHe played three more matches at the end of last season after Wimbledon were promoted, but he has been unable to make a Premier League appearance this term because of injury.\n\n“I was disappointed I was injured and the last few weeks I've been out a few weeks,” said Benson.\n\n“It's been frustrating but it's just a question of trying to get back to it.\n\n\"Everyone is in good spirits here, the spirit is great and we've got good players. We've got a good group of lads and everyone is all behind the team – the whole squad, the whole club.\n\n“It's a great atmosphere at the moment, the place is buzzing. Even having a bad day on the pitch seems to make the crowd louder on the stadium.\n\n“It's a good opportunity for me to get out there and see what it's like against a good opposition and get my head in the game.\n\n\"I think everyone is looking forward to it and it will be a good learning experience for all of us.”\n\nBROADBENT IN GOOD FORM\n\nBroadbent was a surprise signing for Wimbledon in July – the club's eighth summer arrival.\n\nOn paper he is quite a prospect, but the young Englishman, who arrived at Stamford Bridge from Millwall, has struggled to make any impact early on in his Stamford Bridge career. That, however, hasn't stopped him getting a couple of goals, despite having played under new Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink. On Saturday he has been a threat in the air in front of goal.\n\n“For a young boy, it's difficult,” said Broadbent, when asked what it's like returning to his former club Wimbledon.\n\n“There is a little bit of a buzz around when you return, but I think the manager is the best place for me to be.\n\n“He has shown through a couple of signings and training that he is looking to challenge for the top four so I guess I am going to need to play my part and try and get into the same mould he is going to mould my game around.”\n\nHe may hope for the best next year and a possible move away from Stamford Bridge, but the teenager is only 17. This was his first taste of senior football, but he is full of confidence already.\n\n“I went to a training camp and I played in a reserve game for the first time, which was good,” said Broadbent.\n\n“In the reserve game I started and I did well. I have had a few injuries this term but I am training and working hard in training.”\n\nWith so far", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Bowerman had wanted to be a doctor, but couldn't afford medical school. Instead he taught at a tiny high school in Oregon and wrote an op-ed in the _New York Times_ about the plight of poor kids. The op-ed came out just as the magazine _Life_ was planning a series on poor kids in American schools, and Bowerman convinced them to let him write for them. Soon the company started sending Bowerman out to interview children and do profiles on their lives. It would become one of the greatest legacies of The Oregon Project, and its most celebrated story, yet he took a year out of it to travel alone through Russia in 1978. Then he returned home with a new outlook on life and a lot of new stories of the children he had met on his travels.\n\nAt the end of that year, Bowerman sold a piece to a magazine called _Backpacker_ called the article of which is called \"The Last of the Mohicans.\" It was the first of his many exposés of what American kids were actually doing for one another. He followed that up with \"The Great School Heist of America,\" a series of stories about the children working in a soup kitchen in Boston, the most famous for its image of four children stealing a loaf of bread from a store on Saturday morning. Then, before he graduated from high school, he wrote a magazine called _Sesame Street_ and told more than sixty stories about children on the streets of New York City.\n\nA lot of these stories are told by other people. Bowerman's take on them tends to be a bit more vivid, with long stretches of first-person narration that seem to give more detail than the stories themselves. But I think the best way to understand the world of the kids he wrote about was by attending high school with them: in _Boys of Blue Ribbon High_, the narrator attends the same school, and the kids are pretty much their age. So by reading that book, it's like reading an account of the world through the eyes of real kids.\n\n**JON SHAWN:**\n\nThere's a lot of things about this book that you'll know. He's one of your favorite writers, and there's something going on in Portland in the early '70s where one of the greatest basketball players ever comes into being. When he first came onto the scene, a lot of people weren't as friendly about sports as they have become. He grew up being a pretty good basketball player at a time when a lot of people didn't like him as an athlete and didn't like it when he started talking about things that the average boy wouldn't, or shouldn't.\n\nOne of the things that he had to do for all the attention from talking so much about things that his peers didn't want to talk about was that he had to start talking to them. When he was really young, he made a commitment to start hanging out outside of basketball and start doing activities that didn't happen in the typical boyhood of the times. People told him that his approach wasn't a good business strategy, but there was a lot of stuff he was telling the kids about things they needed to be good kids about, so even though they were saying he wasn't good at what he was doing, he was really doing something important. Some of the stuff he talked about to the kids wasn't the typical stuff that most parents were talking to you about.\n\nWhen John went back and was writing this book, he was going back and talking to a lot of these same kids. I was able to go back to high school and I got to meet him and talk to him as a writer, trying to get a feel of exactly what he was talking about.\n\n**JONAH LEARN:**\n\nI'm lucky that I knew him. I'm lucky that I went to high school with him, because that was definitely a moment in time. He was somebody that I would go to with advice, and there were a lot of kids like that. He wrote about some of the kids from other high schools and other cities, but I don't think that he covered everybody. If I was going to be a writer and I was trying to figure out where to start talking about my own life as a kid and what a kid growing up in this era would be like living, I would call John one of three. That would be James Lipton from New York, I would put John into the category of writing from another time and place, and the third would be someone that I would call the _Portland Tribune_. I got to know a bunch of people there, and they were the real deal. We talked to each other a lot when we were in that age group.\n\n**DANIEL SHAY:**\n\nWhat you'll know, you'll know.

{"text": "I suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be part of a cycle of seven American films on the topic of the space program, which explains why it was released, to the general populace, as a featurette on The Man in Space. It is certainly one of the more forgettable of its cohort and even the cast is mostly interchangeable (George Kennedy for instance is a character actor, so a lot of his presence has to be supplied by the script). It also has that famous \"wanting to be there\" feeling about it, the same \"wanting to be at that special place\" as those other films, like Conquest of Space or We Can Build You, do as they get deeper into space travel and the possibility that astronauts can one day travel to the planets, but it never really comes together. A good part of this is that, even as an actor, Kennedy is somewhat wooden and is hamstrung by his surroundings in a lot of scenes. The problem is the script itself.\n\nWhat should have made for an interesting film is the idea of what happens when these people live, not just for six months, but six years in a space capsule. We learn in the movie that these people are not as prepared as they might have thought, in other words, they have never been in space before and the result is that their personal relationships suffer, they become bored, and, most likely, one or more of the astronauts suffers hallucinations. These hallucinations, like the ones in 2001, are not of other-worldly, but instead of people from their past. All of this is very easy to accept as real in a movie like this (but not so easy in 2001 since the main character was not a hallucination, he was quite real). The problem is, that it could be real and it is certainly something one experiences when living on a space station, not like 2001 where the characters are just projections made by the alien force.\n\nSo what we get is an astronaut who loses the people in his life and goes nuts for some months. He does go back home after six months, but as Kennedy himself says when he is interviewed for a space-related magazine, \"It's not the same. We were apart a long time and I won't say that it was the best thing I ever did—but it was the right thing for a young man such as myself. I couldn't have accomplished my goals without the experience.\" Of course, he has also grown to appreciate his first space voyage and, even though his family will be disappointed in his absence, he is content being alone, with no need to see anyone.\n\nThe movie is so poorly cast and the script is so clunky that it is hard to believe he did not know how bad it would be and the few parts that have a certain amount of charm, such as an early scene in which Kennedy and his boss, Major Johnstone (Arthur Franz), discuss the possibility of a long voyage where the astronauts have some down time at the cost of a mission; or an extended shot of the space mission which shows one of Kennedy's hallucinations in vivid Technicolor of his wife, Susan (Joan Freeman), in the 1960s, when he was still alive. It seems an odd choice by the director (George McCowan), however, to use the 1960s as a backdrop to the present instead of showing the present as an alternative to 1960. After all, what if the astronaut had gotten back and a decade had passed?\n\nEven with a few small pieces of charm, the film does not work very well and the last half hour drags like molasses.\n\nAnd I am really bothered by the fact that there was a man who wrote that movie. In what universe does such a script come from? It never had a future as a film.\n\nBut this is a documentary, with one side of the story told in archival footage, interviews and home movies, so it is the story from the perspective of an engineer and an astronaut who talks about their experience. From time to time, it uses narration, but mostly, it is just dialogue between these guys and the history that has surrounded them since they were born. And the result is some of the most moving and fascinating home movies that are out there.\n\nWhen we get to the story, we are at Edwards Air Force Base, on the edge of the Mojave desert, and about 20 years before this video was shot. We see the first of the four space stations that were built in the U.S. in the 1950s. NASA was so impressed with these stations in orbit that they ordered two more. The other two were built without major funding and are known as the two \"boogers\" of NASA, meaning that they are just giant balls that seem to serve no purpose at the time and are not even really part of the space program as much as a means of keeping the astronauts fit and sane. A lot of things were learned from them, including that they didn", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "rapid reduction of a large acute subdural hematoma has been observed immediately after implantation with a subdural balloon catheter \\[[@B10]\\]. However, these results are difficult to extrapolate to the postoperative course or to chronic conditions. Intriguingly, no randomized control trials are available evaluating the role of the subdural space. Although there has been a report of successful reduction of chronic intracranial space occupying lesions with a subdural balloon catheter \\[[@B11]\\], the use of a balloon catheter to evacuate chronic subdural hematomas has never been reported. Herein, we have used a balloon catheter for evacuation and have achieved successful drainage in a patient with a large chronic subdural hematoma. The patient was kept under an intensive care setting with careful management of her airways and anticoagulation regimen. If the patient has a life-threatening condition, the possibility of hemorrhage from the surgical wound should be considered. Also, there is a possibility of infection in the subdural space; therefore, it is essential to monitor the patient for such complications. The patient in this case was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis based on transthoracic echocardiography, and, at that time, her cardiac status could not be assessed. The perioperative management was a challenge for us. In addition, her aortic stenosis was not resolved after surgery; therefore, anticoagulation was discontinued during postoperative follow-up. The patient received no thrombolysis or thrombectomy treatments because of the possible risk of bleeding. She continued to receive anticoagulation without thrombolytic therapy despite a large subdural hematoma and a risk of aortic thrombotic occlusion. The risk of thrombotic occlusion of cerebral vessels should be considered to treat a large subdural hematoma with anticoagulation.\n\nIn this case, the patient had a cardiac history of aortic stenosis and was on chronic anticoagulation. However, the decision of not administering heparin was based on the concern of the patients\\' severe condition with potential life-threatening complications. The decision to continue anticoagulation postoperatively was based on the possible risk of hemorrhage from surgical wounds due to low heparin concentrations in the postoperative period. There is a concern that the size of the lesion gradually increases on the postoperative course; however, no other signs of acute hemorrhage were presented in this case.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIn this report, we have described a case of a large chronic subdural hematoma that was successfully treated with a subdural catheter and heparin. In the setting of acute subdural hematoma evacuation after spontaneous brain injury, subdural balloon catheters are a valuable adjunct tool. This case also provides new information on the subdural space. Subdural balloon catheters can be used for acute evacuation or chronic hematomas as well as for evacuation of the subdural space with subdural hematomas.\n\nConsent\n=======\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

{"text": "IngredientsStepsIf you're using a can of diced tomatoes, blend them for several minutes in a blender or purée them briefly in a food processor before tossing them with the onions.[1] If you'd like to make the soup even healthier, you can omit the oil and instead sauté the onions in a little bit of water. As always, the main thing is to reduce the sodium.[2]\n\nUse fresh tomatoes or tomato sauce. The flavor of canned tomatoes is significantly dull. If you are using them, rinse the tomatoes under water, then drain them and add them to the pot. Stir them frequently throughout the process.\n\nMake sure you have enough water at the bottom of the pot. You want the bottom three inches or so of water to be simmering, not bubbling.\n\nYou can add any ingredients you'd like. As always, the main goal is to reduce the sodium.\n\n[3]\n\nIf you'd like to add meat to this recipe, look at the other variations we included (especially the low-sodium one).\n\nHow can you adjust the fat, and reduce the sodium?\n\n[4]\n\nA low-sodium tomato soup can be made in many ways. You can add as little or as much fat as you'd like. You could, for example, omit the oil from the onions, as some people prefer, or you could add less sodium-reducing ingredients.\n\nOne way you could add some fat is to blend onions with the liquid from a can (or use part or all of a drained can to get the liquid). You could also try using oil instead of onions to sauté them. You could also use fat-free sour cream or crumbled feta (or try a different cheese to lower the fat) to enhance the flavor. Note that all these changes to the recipe would, in and of themselves, increase the fat.\n\nYou probably shouldn't do a low-fat recipe as is. Because low-fat recipes tend to be low in both water and flavor, they're often oversweet. You'd have to balance low fat with high sodium to keep the texture and flavor.\n\nHow can you cut the fat?\n\nThe fat you add to tomato soup is often cream or half-and-half. These are commonly used to make tomato soup lighter and/or creamier. (Note that \"light cream\" is often the same as \"half-and-half\" or \"heavy cream\".) These fats are usually used as a flavoring or as a way to boost the flavor of the soup rather than to cut the amount of fat. Reducing the amount of cream or fat that is added gives you a smoother soup.\n\nHere are a few ways you could reduce the amount of fat used.\n\nMake the soup taste rich and fatty. You can do this by using the rich flavor and fat of heavy cream or half-and-half. The problem with doing this is that it means you'll need to use more than you did if you added more water, reducing the overall number of calories in your recipe.[5]\n\nYou could try half-and-half instead of cream. This has a distinct flavor compared to cream and tastes much richer. Unlike most soups, you can easily use less fat with half-and-half than you can with cream. (In fact, half-and-half might have no fat at all!)\n\nYou can use a smaller amount of high-fat cream. For example, if you were using a half-and-half and half-and-half combination, you could use less one of the other in your recipe to keep the fat content at the original level.\n\nSince cream has a lot of fat and calories, it should be in smaller quantities while still giving you the flavor and richness you desire. Also, it has a bad reputation for being too rich. Thus, half-and-half might be a better option, as it tastes better and is usually lower in calories.\n\nAdd salt water to a thin layer at the bottom of the pot. After you've cooked the onions, return some of the water at the bottom of the sauté pan to the pot and add a small amount of salt. You won't be adding a lot of sodium, but it will certainly reduce the sodium in your recipe!\n\nMix 1/8 teaspoon of salt to 1-1/2 cups of water. Using this technique should give you a sodium reduction that won't completely mask the other natural flavors in the soup.\n\nThis technique might not work too well in a recipe that relies on the other natural flavors in tomatoes to mask a lot of the sodium.\n\nYou might be able to use a blend of a few techniques; try them all to see what works best for you.\n\nYou can substitute another form of salt for the granulated or table salt. For example, you can try finely ground", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Harvard has purchased tracts of land in Allston, a walkable area on Boston’s northern periphery close to Fenway Park and Harvard and Tufts Medical Schools. The land that is being purchased is part of “Allston’s Great Green Space,” an open space that runs for almost 9 miles from just west of Tufts’ medical campus to a parcel that is home to a number of schools.\n\nThese “Great Green Spaces” include the Allston/Brighton Trolley Greenway, a former trolley line that runs through one of the city’s more walkable neighborhoods. This land will be developed into affordable residences and a new street, which will eventually run right through the heart of Allston from Medford St. to Commonwealth Ave. The land being purchased runs along Commonwealth Ave. through Allston, with Harvard, Boston College’s medical school, and the new Harvard Medical School building located at the western side of the parcel.\n\nAt its closest to Medford St. the land that will be developed stretches out into the former site of Allston Landing, a mixed-use, publicly funded project that was envisioned as a transit-oriented mixed-use development. It now is being redeveloped as a much lower density housing project known as Allston Landing. Much of this development is being funded via the sale of public land and the federal and state Low Income Tax Credits.\n\nIn his announcement of the purchase, the university stated that the land being purchased is a portion of “a larger property that includes the [Allston/Brighton Trolley Greenway],” and will be “a new extension of Commonwealth Avenue, a linear park that will connect the Allston Landing project to the Medical School.” This extension will run from the existing Medford St. overpass, through the Medford St. Station, which will run under the Greenway to provide vehicular access, and through Fenway Park to the proposed Medford Street Station near the Medical Admits building. Along the way, it will intersect with other public right of ways, including the “Pierce Road Greenway, a pedestrian connection from Medford Street to the Allston-Brighton Trolley Greenway.”\n\nFenway Park, shown at the far western end of the land being purchased. Photo: Google Street View.\n\nIf I had to guess (and my gut is not my best guide in this case), I imagine the purchase price will be about $4.5 million, and be funded through a combination of proceeds generated from the sale of the public lands, state Low Income Tax Credits, and other unspecified financial supports. A small portion of the land purchase price will be allocated to the “purchase of an Allston/Brighton Greenway trolley,” likely with a view to the eventual construction of a station at the Medford St. Greenway overpass.\n\nThe Allston Community Planning & Development (APD) agency will be undertaking environmental review of construction and neighborhood impacts. This will likely be followed by the APD’s approval of plans for Allston Landing, and will hopefully be tied into the larger planning process for the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA).\n\nAccording to a Boston Globe article regarding the land sale, “[t]he sale will help Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh close a budget deficit, and provide funds to start construction on the state's first new medical school in nearly half a century.”\n\nThis is just one of the examples of this kind of large public land sale and development project that Boston is experiencing on the edge of its neighborhoods and in the heart of major public parks.\n\nThe “Great Green Space” will be part of a much larger plan on the edge of Allston and the bordering neighborhood of Brighton. In 2016 the city of Boston released a report and plan for the area, but few specifics of their recommendations have been revealed. According to the city’s report, that “the neighborhood’s public amenities” are “the core components of [that] plan.” This “public amenities” include parkland and green space, and the expansion or improvement of “housing,” and “retail.”\n\nThe parkland is currently home to the newly renovated Eliot Pond Park. The pond has also been expanded in size through a project financed by the City. More parkland is under construction as part of the larger Eliot Pond Park Greenway Extension project, which will run right through this and surrounding land. This project will be a “a linear park that will connect the Allston Landing project to the Medical School.” But, because it is a part of the Greater Boston Greenway, it is being completed at the same time as the Allston/Brighton Trolley Greenway, an existing transit-oriented, linear greenway running", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "The ECB committed to injecting at least â‚¬1.1 trillion (Â£834bn) of liquidity into the eurozone banking system. And the Bank of England followed suit by pledging as much as â‚¬750bn.\n\nYet a senior executive at Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, says: “The ECB could do no more. They do not have money to lend.”\n\nThere is one last issue to address. The IMF – which is not an independent institution – says that the financial sector could run out of money if the European Central Bank extends money to the core economies, such as Germany and France, at a speed and scale that dwarfs its existing emergency support programmes. It says this could lead to a collapse of the lending markets and a credit crunch.\n\nThe Fund also says that if governments impose fiscal austerity, the damage to private credit markets in these areas could turn into a global crisis.\n\nAnd finally, the IMF says that European governments will have to be prepared to “disclose their fiscal policies by 1 July 2013”, because the international bailout scheme will have to be revised by the end of this month.\n\nThe consequences could be far-reaching, even for Germany. The Federal Reserve’s vice-chairman, Daniel Tarullo, is due to visit Greece as part of his European circuit. If that trip goes ahead – and the IMF believes it could happen this coming Monday – it would send an even further powerful signal that a bailout programme is about to be finalised. For Germany, especially, this would be a bitter pill.\n\nThe IMF is right to press the case for Europe’s governments to do more to ensure that there are no new crises. But its response to the recent Greek debt writedown does not necessarily address the fundamental problem they face.\n\nThe IMF says that the private-sector exposure of eurozone banking systems to Greek debt amounts to €50.1bn, equivalent to 23 per cent of their outstanding loans. And it says there are a further €2.6 trillion of bonds issued by eurozone countries with similar obligations to Greece.\n\nThe Fund says that European governments should support their banks by injecting funds directly and by raising their deposit insurance limits so that they can fund the cost or write off the losses on this debt. Under the present circumstances, that means either a reduction in public debt – which is unaffordable for eurozone states at present – or a large and immediate rise in taxes.\n\nSuch decisions are not easy to make. But the alternative of a default on this debt could plunge the world’s economies into a deflationary spiral.\n\nThe crisis in Europe’s banking system is not the same as the financial crisis in 2007-8 when the US and other countries were saved from collapse by a bailout of Wall Street that was provided by both the US government and by the euro. The situation is different.\n\nFirstly, the crisis in the euro is the consequence of the single currency’s inherent failure. It is not caused by banks lending recklessly, except where that has contributed to the crisis through a combination of an economic boom fuelled by cheap money and loose lending, and then a bust of unsustainable credit growth. Secondly, the banks of eurozone countries all have to be recapitalised by their governments. That is entirely different from the Wall Street rescue where the private sector was kept whole. The US government had no responsibility for the insolvency of Wall Street; and the German government will have no responsibility, at present, for the insolvency of its own banks.\n\nWhat concerns me is the fact that it seems the eurozone has turned its back on a fiscal union which would allow it to have an automatic stabilising mechanism in place within a year. I would be fascinated to hear the views of George Osborne and others around the European Union on this one. Would it not be possible for the euro to move away from having a purely technocratic executive board that is responsible for dealing with the issue? The Germans seem to have an unhealthy love of technocratic solutions. Perhaps they are now waking up to what a disaster the euro project has been. In a few days it will be a year since the Irish decided not to join the euro. There is little evidence that the consequences have been discussed at the highest level, with the consequence of an emergency meeting at some point in the next few weeks. Perhaps the crisis could be tackled in that forum. But, having decided to create the euro, it would have been useful to find a solution. Perhaps now will be the time for the other member states to discuss what this union will look like, and who should pay the membership fee to join.", "label": "gptj"}

But there's trouble with the local farmers - who want to make the village less attractive to humans - and their plot has just been uncovered. There's an attempt to capture the fox and take him back to a zoo where the cages are very tight and it's likely he'll die - what can the fox do to save himself? And what will happen to the humans in the meantime? Fantastic characters - I really liked them - and a marvellous read as well as being an easy and fascinating story to follow.\n\nI love these characters, as I love all the books by Richard Adams - I think I've read all the novels and the collections. I think I'd better not ask what books are in this series - although I often ask what the book is from my collection when they ask for recommendations! I'll just say that it was a splendid book. Absolutely marvellous.\n\nI'd read some of Richard Adams' other books before this one, like Last Days, but I didn't know much about the characters or what the book was about. I'm glad I picked this up first and found out more while I was reading the rest of the series - it's probably that - because they are all so well-written and the characters are so likeable. Adams writes about a fox called Benjamin, who is just coming into his own as a character. He's the only fox of four brothers and has the misfortune - or the talent - of being the only one the humans like. Ben is clever and enjoys the benefits of being at the centre of all the human attention they bring him. He finds out that, when he comes up for sale, it's because the neighbouring farmer plans to sell him to an animal circus or safari and ship him off to a zoo, and he and his brothers fight their best to escape. They manage to avoid capture in plenty of time and, luckily, all four survive through the years - there's no way for a fox so used to living with humans to escape now - and are taken to the zoo. Here's where their troubles really start and I loved every minute of the story - Adams does have some great comic scenes - about when a new animal keeper comes in and all his own staff know each other anyway and don't bother him when animals need attention. Benjamin finds a way to escape again and returns to the humans, then he starts working out the secrets of their lives - who likes each other and who doesn't, how they live, what they do for each other etc. He discovers the humans are not as wonderful as they seem and their problems are not over in a hurry.\n\nTo summarise: this is another really good series. I like that Adams has written it in the language we have in real life. It is easy for adults and children to read and understand and the characters are so human. Well done, Richard, and thanks for another wonderful series.\n\nWhat I didn't know before beginning the latest Thomas Holt book was that it was an ongoing series about a fox and his friends in a village in Scotland until he is taken to the zoo. I didn't much like this at first - it was much too realistic, more like an actual story rather than a novel. I'm glad I picked it up and decided to give it another try though - it grew on me as I kept reading and, of course, soon realised that it's a series of books rather than a standalone and has been going for a long time. I think this is because the authors are so interested in all the characters' lives - even in the main story in this book - and they aren't just trying to make money out of this or get readers or anything else. Every story about the animals at the zoo becomes part of the main one. Some humans are more important to the animals than others - that's understandable, because they need the animals for company and amusement and to make a living anyway. All of the characters have interesting back stories and the main story isn't so serious - it shows the main animals as really good at escaping and how it's all done.\n\nThere are three characters we follow throughout the series: the fox, Benjamin, a hedgehog called Sniff and a guinea pig called Scruffy who sometimes joins in as they try to get away. Benjamin is about eleven in this book and he is getting quite strong and strong-minded. He's starting to work out which humans don't like each other as much as he thinks they do, and where this is in the village from where they live, who will like each other most and who might not. Benjamin wants to find out whether what he knows isn't true - that animals like the humans and feel more at ease with them. But his parents tell him to do some simple human things, rather than try to break out of every cage they live in, so their", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "To the east is the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River; to the north are the peaks of the Sangre de Cristos and the San Juan Mountains; to the west and south are the Great Plains and its famous wind tunnels. It wasn a perfect place for two college guys to find refuge from civilization. It was more like a place of refuge from the people, a place of solitude and tranquility. And that was fine with them.\n\nOne spring, just after graduation, I traveled to New York City to attend a college fair there. The college of my dreams was one of the booths set up at the fair. They even had a tour group take the students through the college. I got a glimpse of the campus that night. I fell in love with the place, so I drove home as fast as I could to tell my parents.\n\nMy dad asked, “Why New York?”\n\n“Because I want to go to the college,” I said.\n\n“What college?”\n\n“You can always come with me to New York to visit if you want to,” I said.\n\nHe took my hand and said, “That’s true, son. You can come to New York if you want and we’ll visit the college. When, not if.”\n\nLife had turned upside down for the two of us. My mom found it even harder because I had left her hometown and my two brothers, ages nine and seven, were all on their own. She worried that I was setting myself up for failure. But I wasn’t. Instead, I had set myself up for success. She worried I’d be an empty, lonely, miserable twenty-year-old just like my father had been at fifteen. Again, I told her to go, “that’s true, but you’ll be able to see your grandchildren.”\n\nI called my mom every Sunday on her birthday. I loved her, but I loved my dad more. And she knew it. Whenever I talked to her, it was like she already knew what was going to happen (she didn’t, of course, but we were all a little crazy).\n\nDad, too.\n\nI knew what I was in for right away. While I was gone a few nights a week, Mom and Dad ate dinner alone every night. They had each other. But they were different somehow. He was always alone at dinner; she was always with people (that’s one way she was different from me). Dad would talk about the guys I played soccer with, which helped him deal with missing me while I was gone. I think he missed me as well, but he was too busy doing it for both of us.\n\nAt the end of a long phone conversation with my mom, she always said, “Call me on my birthday”. By that time, it was getting late at night, and I didn’t want to call at all. But I wanted to call because she would never call me on my birthday. So, one day, I called long-distance and said, “Mom, I’m sorry I just called out of the blue. I can’t remember when your birthday is so I didn’t call on the last day of March or the first day of April. It’s October 19th, isn’t it?”\n\n“That’s right,” she said. “I’m glad you remembered.”\n\nHe would, too.\n\nAnd, he did.\n\nShe always sent me pictures of her and Dad. She would have been sixty three last year. He died exactly one year to the day.\n\nOn her birthday every year, she would put out two bowls of M&Ms and a slice of peanut butter pie for everyone to share. They liked pie. Mom didn’t care if they liked it or not, but she liked making it because she always made sure I ate some right away—even if I was eating a salad. Whenever she did that, she would also say, that pie is a gift. So I had to eat at least one for her birthday every year. It’s a simple, but precious, gift, she said. It can mean a lot to someone.\n\nWhen Dad died, she didn’t put out pie.\n\nBut she did put out cookies that she had made. That year I came to New York. She didn’t say she was going to make them. She didn’t have to.\n\nAt the end of the week, we would have a nice breakfast. She’d make French toast or waffles. We could have bacon and eggs or pancakes and sausage. She", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "we analyze the optical counterpart to the ultra - compact (UC) X-ray binary (XRB) V4641 Sgr using archival Chandra and Hubble observations. The optical counterpart is bright and blue, with a spectrum strongly constraining its nature as an O8-9 main-sequence star. Our light curve implies a superhump period of 3.95 hours, nearly one-third of the 3.91-hour X-ray period proposed by @Dieters+Soria+Campana+Hynes2007. We also present spectral line evidence for a wind in the optical spectrum that is very slow and unusually broad for O-stars, probably caused by the strong FeII emission. Because of its low luminosity and rapid rotation ($v$ sin $i$ = 450 kms$^{-1}$), the putative companion is not orbiting the supergiant, but instead is a binary companion in a wide, mildly eccentric orbit. A fit of the radial velocity orbit to our UV spectra suggests an inclination angle of $60^{\\circ}$, making the companion orbit inclined with respect to the massive stellar surface.\n\nObservations\n============\n\nThe data were obtained from two sources. The optical and ultraviolet (UV) images and ground-based optical spectra were acquired by the X-Ray Monitoring System (XMS) at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. UV spectra through the F22T\\_AOR and F15R\\_AOR were obtained with the STIS instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope [@Gilliland+2003]. The data presented in table \\[tab:stis\\] were obtained from observations taken with the E230M grating with the E230 (low dispersion) or the STIS E140M (medium dispersion) echelle configurations, and the E230M + E140M and STIS echelle modes provide the same spectral coverage with resolutions $R \\approx 7,000$ in the optical and $R \\approx 9,000$ in the UV. Our analysis of the optical spectra and XMS images is described in detail by @van-Zyl2004 and @van-Zyl2005.\n\nX-ray and UV observations were performed in the year 2004, and were obtained with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) as part of regular monitoring of high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) for outburst signatures. The data were analyzed using version 12.0.1 of [ Ciao](http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/) with standard filtering. The data for V4641 Sgr were obtained in Cycle 17, starting UT August 2, 2005; they represent typical CCD readout streak, and do not have any significant pileup. The data for XTE J1118+480 were processed in Cycle 18, starting September 2006; this data set has the worst ACIS CCD streak and contains noticeable pileup.\n\nThe X-ray light curve\n---------------------\n\nThere are two observations of V4641 Sgr in our archive. The first was obtained on 2000 Aug 5, with ACIS-S for an exposure of 0.7 hr, and the second was obtained on 2002 Aug 4, with ACIS-I for a longer exposure of 5.3 hr. The X-ray light curve reveals two features, shown in detail in Figure \\[fig:lightcurve\\]. One of these, a long, bright outburst that began on August 2, 2005, was described in detail by @Dieters+Soria+Campana+Hynes2007. This light curve, along with the X-ray spectral analysis of the data obtained during the outburst, shows that the optical counterpart to this system is an unusual O-star with a large amount of circumstellar matter that, when viewed in the UV, is thought to originate in a slow stellar wind. The other X-ray observation, obtained on 2004 Aug 5, does not confirm that this star is in outburst, despite the high X-ray detection rate of the optical counterpart (Figure \\[fig:lightcurve\\], left panel).\n\nThe outburst observed in 2001 [@Dieters+Soria+Campana+Hynes2007; @Garnavich+Chen+2000] was observed in one observation only, and that was obtained by @Smith+Dieters2005 using HST ACS for a long exposure of 5.1 hr. That observation consisted of one single pointing with the ACS/WFC and CCDs F450W and F814W, and is shown in figure \\[fig:lightcurve\\]. We note that the ACS F450W data do not include the CCD edge of the optical field, which is also the outer-most edge of the UV field. Because of the ACS/WFC field of view,", "label": "gptj"}

An epidemiological survey for DF prevalence was performed on 1180 hospitalized patients with diabetic foot from September 2010 to December 2011. Among these patients, 381 patients (33.2%) developed a DF, and 121 patients (9.9%) reported a nonhealing foot ulcer. The median age was 63.9 ± 10.9 years and the male/female ratio was 0.9. The duration of diabetes was 15.1 ± 10.3 years. The majority of the subjects were being treated with insulin (70.5%) and the average foot ulcer duration was 15.3 ± 13.2 days. The overall prevalence of DF was 33.2% (381 of 1180 patients). The ulcers were mainly type III (63%), IV.A. or IV.B. (61.8%), type II (37%), type IV.A. or IV.B. (35.4%), grade IV.A. or IV.B. (30.6%), and grade III (8.7%). The incidence rate and prevalence of DF in patients with Type 2 diabetes on admission were 33.23 ± 10.5% and 331 ± 637 patients per year; 31.2 (±9.4) and 311 (±616) patients per year for those with non-healing DF, and 28.5 (±9.1) and 282 ± 662 patients per year for those with healing DF. The incidence and prevalence rates in patients who were administered a specific wound dressing and were treated with an appropriate medication after admission showed significant statistical differences (p < 0.05). This study confirms the high prevalence rate of DF in patients with Type 2 diabetes, with a high incidence and prevalence rate in those with non-healing DF. Therefore, early identification of DF by performing risk assessment and appropriate management is the most effective approach to reducing its incidence and prevalence rates.", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "backgroundfamilial mediterranean fever ( fmf ) is an autosomal recessive systemic disease. It appears mainly in childhood and adolescence but can occur at all ages. This disease is also known as Mediterranean fever ( Mf ), Behan's disease, Behcet's disease and the disease of the Dutch children and is characterized by symptoms with long-lasting remissions and exacerbations. Its first description was in a letter written by a Greek physician in 1891. In 1937, Behcet described the disease in a Turkish patient living in Jiddah, who was a descendant from the Middle East; this patient was later diagnosed as fmf in Iran. As many as 200 cases and 300,000 patients are reported in the literature. The frequency of fmf in different parts of the world differs from its highest incidence rate in the Middle East and in other countries in the Mediterranean. This disease has worldwide geographic distribution in the Middle East, Turkey, Iran, and North Africa. As the primary lesions of fmf occur in the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract and the eyes, the diagnosis of the disease is based mainly on clinical findings. However, some imaging findings, which can be very helpful in its differential diagnosis, help increase the diagnostic accuracy. The diagnostic measures used for the diagnosis of fmf are: 1) clinical findings (duration of febrile episodes, joint involvement, eye involvement and orogenital ulcers, and abdominal pain) and their associations; 2) familial or personal histories of fmf; 3) physical examination and findings of systemic involvement; 4) examination of tissue biopsies; and 5) laboratory investigations including serologic analysis, immunoglobulin levels, urinalysis, serum electrophoresis, and culture of blood and urine. We present five patients diagnosed with fmf, who were followed for various periods and also follow-up and control radiologic and sonographic findings. Patients 1-3 were a family group and had a diagnosis of fmf for 15 years. Patients 4 and 5 were the probands of the family and had a history of fmf-like disorders since childhood. We performed imaging, serologic, and genetic studies and confirmed their diagnoses.\n\nIt is a relatively common disease in childhood, but in the first decade there are no differences with Crohn's disease. The symptoms start with abdominal pain, diarrhea and the child may also have rectal bleeding. In the second decade, pain may be more present in the back, or pain in the extremities, and the diarrhea may be more severe. At the end of the third decade, pain, diarrhea and fever may decrease and abdominal pain is the most frequent symptom. In the fourth decade of life, some cases may present with acute pancolitis.\n\nIt is a relatively common disease in childhood, but in the first decade there are no differences with Crohn's disease.

Argentina has about 50 million inhabitants and half of them use the Public Health System, whereas the other half are covered by private insurance, which has been considered by the government to be inefficient, and it has not shown that the poor are better served. In 1996, the Ministry of Health created the Paramedical Service and at that time, about 1 million patients were attending the Medical Units and the rest of the services were to be created in the future. The goal was the development and dissemination of the knowledge of the disease and a health system that was as safe as possible by the development and implementation of educational programs, guidelines and protocols, and by a health system that is effective, accessible and of high quality, which ensures the population's health. At the same time, patients would be able to see specialists and would be able to refer themselves and would pay for their care, following a system where the poor would not lose their access to health care services. The main objective has been achieved. There are four areas or services: the preventive area, the prenatal area, the medical area and the administrative services.\n\nThe objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and the predictors of the outcome (failure and success) in our series of patients.

{"text": "For those out there that like to think of themselves as political junk-o-jargon junkies, there is a certain degree to which every piece of news is an object for contemplation.\n\nWhen Obama took office, in the wake of the 2008-2009 Bush Recession, the question was: Will this continue, or will the recovery take hold?\n\nWill the public begin to believe in the economic recovery? Or will it be the start of a new era of austerity and slow growth?\n\nWhere will the Democratic Party come back from?\n\nWill the U.S. remain a superpower? Or be relegated to second-tier globalist status, with American power on the wane?\n\nObama had to show that he had something to do with the improving economy; that he had turned things around.\n\nHe had to be, essentially, all things to all men. All the while, people were wondering: How will he respond to a challenge?\n\nObama was still considered the weakest of the Obama administration's presidential contenders.\n\nIn the first years of his administration, Obama responded to events by adopting very passive methods.\n\nAt first, Obama was content to play defense, the way his campaign played defense in debates.\n\nHe was defensive before the November elections.\n\nObama was passive because of bad poll-reading or an unwillingness to challenge the polls.\n\nHe didn't have strong poll ratings of his own, but the polls were generally predicting Democratic victory.\n\nBarack Obama had only recently been elected president. Yet, he had to deal with the consequences of decades of neglect. He had to show he was capable of managing. He had to demonstrate he could lead, or the American people would no longer look to him.\n\nThe first few years of Barack Obama's first term were about managing and managing. The economy had to be fixed and managed. And so, Obama's first term was about managing the economy. He had to manage the housing bubble; he had little choice but to manage it. He had to manage the economy to prove his value; he couldn't afford to just let the economy fail.\n\nPresident Obama's policies are not so much those of a \"moderate Republican\" as he has been accused of being by many conservative Republicans themselves, but Obama's policies and his politics have moved the leftward-and-center position.\n\nObama and Rahm Emanuel are so far to the left of \"moderate\" Democrat that they are, by extension, to the left of the far-left. This is evident in Obamacare, in Obama's political decisions, and in Obama's political agenda that has moved the country far to the left in many ways.\n\nThe Obamacare disaster has not been managed by the White House. With Obamacare failing on a daily basis, Obama has resorted to what can only be described as appeasement. Obama is trying to appease his supporters before his election in 2012, and that must be the only explanation for Obama's appeasement of Democrats and liberals.\n\nHe will likely be defeated in the presidential elections -- or else he will probably retire early.\n\nBut the appeasement of Liberal Democrats and Leftist liberals has, so far, succeeded. Obamacare has been given a face-lift. And Obama has proven to his enemies that he is a political man. Obama has made his enemies nervous, but they still don't know what to worry about, or to fear, about the election of 2012. Obama has earned the right to be reelected.\n\nObama's failure to manage the nation has cost him political capital, and now he must try to fix America's problems at a time when the American populace is becoming restive.\n\nThe economic situation and the U.S. economy is not improving in the way the Obama administration would like, however. Obama's reelection will depend on his ability to manage that economy.\n\nIt's the economy, stupid. The American people are beginning to get restless with all the bureacratic stagnation, political intrigue, and waste of taxpayer money at the Treasury Department (which was to be a source of income, once Obamacare and the rest of his agenda was finalized).\n\nThe public is beginning to get restive about the slow pace with which Obama is trying to implement the changes he promised during the campaign. The White House is already facing a possible revolution.\n\nThe White House staff will likely attempt to quell the revolution by managing the economy by managing unemployment. The White House's hope is that by manipulating unemployment rates, Obama can create an environment in which Democrats can be reelected in a few years.\n\nObama will also be tempted to use a tax increase as a justification to raise taxes on the affluent and on the wealthy to provide new revenue to the government. Obama will likely increase taxes on the wealthy just as he increased taxes on the poor during the time he was in Michigan campaigning for the presidency.\n\nAs long as the economy", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "we analyzed the oct features of 24 eyes of 12 OHT patients by OCT. They found that OCT parameters of the inner segment ellipsoid, outer segment ellipsoid, photoreceptor layer, and retinal nerve fiber layer displayed significantly lower values in the OHT than in the control group. In addition, the mean inner segment height and mean photoreceptor layer thickness on OCT significantly decreased according to the OHT grades. The OCT studies by Ritari et al.[@B17] confirmed their earlier finding of photoreceptor thinning, and revealed a progressive deterioration of photoreceptor layer morphology with increase in severity of the OHT. However, it also suggests that the macular layer may be spared in OHT as long as the thickness of RPE remains within normal limits. A significant decline in RPE/Bruch\\'s membrane complex, ganglion cell complex, and choroidal thickness in the inner and outer sectors of OHT was noticed. They also suggested that reduction of RPE/Bruch\\'s membrane complex thickness is an early indicator of RPE loss; ganglion cell complex thinning is due to damage to the optic nerve, or both. These findings could also be due to edema of optic nerve head, or both. Ritari and colleagues[@B18] found that OHT subjects with visual field loss had thinner retinal and photoreceptor layers than those without visual field defect. There was no difference in RPE/Bruch\\'s membrane complex thickness between both groups, though. The above OCT findings are almost similar to the structural findings of the current study.\n\nThe optic nerve structure has been studied by our group by using 3-dimensional-OCT in a non-glaucomatous optic nerve study, the results of which are consistent[@B13]. We found that OCT scan reveals a higher resolution and reproducible optic nerve head morphology. This high level of resolution provides us the possibility to perform further analysis of the normal and glaucomatous OHT in a more detailed manner. The 3-dimensional-OCT reveals a greater change in morphology. It gives a view of the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, optic nerve head volume, the peripapillary choroidal volume, the thickness of nerve fibers connecting retina and optic nerve head, and the nerve fiber bundle length. The nerve fiber bundles are the largest nerve endings and connect the retina to optic nerve head and also give the nerve impulse. In glaucoma, the axons lose their strength and die rapidly causing a decrease in nerve fiber bundles. The thinner the nerve fiber bundles, the faster the nerve cell death. Our study has shown a decreased peripapillary choroidal and optic nerve head choroidal volume and thickness in glaucoma. The peripapillary choroidal and optic nerve head choroidal thickness were significantly thinner in the OHT eyes than normal controls in our study. This is contrary to the earlier findings[@B14][@B18][@B19][@B20] which showed no thickness differences in the OHT. However, it is consistent with the findings of the OCT studies by Joo, et al.[@B13] that show a decrease in the peripapillary choroidal and optic nerve head choroidal volume and thickness in glaucoma. Although there are no prior studies done on the 3-dimensional-OCT and OHT, we think our study is unique as we use the 3-dimensional-OCT which gives one more dimension than the conventional 2-dimensional-OCT. The 3-dimensional-OCT has the capability to provide the quantitative data of nerve fiber bundle in OHT which may prove to be helpful in further understanding the OHT mechanism.\n\nOur study\\'s limitations are the relatively small number of patients in the OHT study group and the absence of the normal OHT group, despite the fact that the study population is well characterized and followed up in all patients. We used both 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography and Heidelberg Spectral-domain and conventional optical coherence tomography. There is some difference that may be noted in these OCT devices like the different retinal layer thicknesses in choroidal layers, and different scan patterns of various OCT machines, which also influence the measurements of the choroid and optic nerve. However, both devices were performed by the same examiner with good reproducibility[@B13].\n\nThis is one of the first reports using the 3-dimensional-OCT to study the volume of inner, outer retinal structure, and optic nerve head choroidal layer thicknesses and to determine the presence of nerve fiber bundle defect in OHT. We think that our findings have shown the potential value of the 3-dimensional-OCT for the earlier detection of RGC loss and structural changes in various optic nerve disorders", "label": "gptj"}

Diocles had already discovered this new type of engine, when he was in charge of transporting goods on roads, where for the ancient Greeks the most important form of transportation was the chariot.\n\nDiocles made an engine, with two parts; the first was half-open, and the second half was fully closed, like a chest. At the beginning of the engine, the opening in the first part was closed by a wedge, while the second part opened up from the first part to take the first fuel, and when the wedge was released, the opening in the first part came completely closed, and only the second opened.\n\nThe first closed part contained a small chamber, which acted as a ‘bellows’. The bellows was then ignited by a spark from a taper. However, the bellows also provided energy, that pushed the wedge which locked the first part and provided force that was transmitted to the crank shaft driving the piston.\n\nAn illustration of Diocles.

In this very first double decker, the engine was used to pull a cart along a set of rails.\n\nDiocles invented the “motor” to take advantage of the same bellows principle described above, and the device was used to build the first double decker buses from the Ancient City of Athens.\n\nThe double decker buses allowed the driver to stop at the back of the bus, when passengers wanted to buy goods, and in this way they used the second part to make a connection point. That is why they were also called “pedes”, which was meaning a wheel.\n\nThere were many different types of double-decker buses.\n\nDiocles of Carystus\n\nDiocles of Carystus made many important inventions. Besides his “motor” he also built tanks of different sizes, and invented the “hydraulic machine”, where two systems of pistons work together with oil and oil is fed from one to the other.\n\nThe cylinder on top of the “hydraulic machine” was of a single or double action depending of what it was for, and inside the hydraulic machine there was a valve. This valve was actuated by a screw that moved when pressure was transferred in it.\n\nDiocles of Carystus built a large number of large and small tanks. There is still a tank built by Diocles in Athens in today’s Museum of Archeology. This tank’s original capacity was 20 men.\n\nThe last name of the inventor Diocles of Carystus.

That is when Roberts needed two ways of delivering coal to the engines of his trams, and he wanted to find a reliable system.\n\nHe invented a double-decker coal trolley, and for that purpose he invented an innovative hydraulic pump (hydraulic machinery). The hydraulic pump was made out of cast-iron and was the most advanced example of his inventions at the time. It is a kind of two-stroke engine that provided motive power to his trams.\n\nThe hydraulic pump of Charles Roberts was a double-decker device.\n\nThe double-decker hydraulic pump of Charles Roberts.\n\nThe hydraulic machine (of type T15, built in the “Railway Institute” in 1874) of the invention of Charles Roberts, which ran the first double-decker steam tram in London, England.\n\nThe original image has a number on it.

The addition of antegrade selective\ncerebral perfusion to hypothermic circulatory arrest did not affect the\nshort-term outcomes, neither did it cause more neurological\ndisabilities.\n\nhypothermic circulatory arrest for adult aortic arch repair is still\nlimited.\n\nwe aim to elucidate the short- and long-term outcomes of hypothermic\ncirculatory arrest in adults undergoing adult aortic arch repair with or\nwithout antegrade selective cerebral perfusion.\n\nIn the literature, preoperative risk factors, the incidence of\nneurological complications after hypothermic circulatory arrest, and the\nsafety of its use in supra-aortic-anastomosis has been reported.1- 5\nAdult aortic arch repair requires temporary occlusion of the origin of\nthe ascending aorta, during which the brain is cooled in profound\nhypothermia (20 ¡C), followed by reperfusion which causes a sharp raise in\ntemperature (33 ¡C) and, then, circulatory arrest. During circulatory\narrest, no blood flow is allowed into the brain, and cerebral blood flow\nis achieved by the collateral circulation.5 However,\nhypothermic circulatory arrest for aortic arch repair has traditionally\ninvolve profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest, limiting its clinical\nimpetus.\n\nThe benefits on the use of this technique have never been\nquantified since the majority of cases are sporadic or in the context of\nresearch protocols. In previous studies, hypothermic circulatory arrest,\nor circulatory arrest with antegrade selective cerebral perfusion, was\nused, but the proportion of each technique was quite different. For\ninstance, in 1993 Koyanagi et al.6 reported 8 cases of aortic\narch repair using profound hypothermic circulatory arrest, while, in 1994,\nWise et al.7 reported 6 cases of aortic arch repair using circulatory\narrest with antegrade selective cerebral perfusion, to a total of 13\npatients operated on using hypothermia and circulatory arrest (figure\n1). The use of these two techniques changed over the years and, in 2010,\nonly one case of adult aortic arch repair with hypothermic circulatory\narrest was reported.8 However, nowadays,\nthe main concern regarding this technique is the increased rate of\nneurological complications, which are associated with a reduction of the\ndegree of brain protection.5\n\nfigure 1\n\nThe number of aortic arch repair using profound hypothermic\ncirculatory arrest according to authors.\n\nOn the other hand, antegrade selective cerebral perfusion\nmeans circulation arrest, in this case combined with selective\ncirculation to the brain. This technique has been used in aortic\ncirculation research, aiming mainly to evaluate the feasibility and\nshort-term safety of antegrade selective cerebral perfusion.9- 11\nSeveral authors, using this technique, have compared it with other\ncirculatory arrest methods for aortic surgery.

{"text": "I shall begin with a disclaimer: This movie is NOT actually a documentary of the life of Adolf Hitler, but instead a fictional retelling of the true story of Adolph Hitler and all those around the Fuhrer during the early years of his rise to power, and the events leading up to the war. This movie takes place between 1930 and 1940, after Hitler, now a known world political figure, has already made his presence felt, but before he rose to power.\n\nI have always held an interest in the early days of Hitler's rise to power, and I thought this would be a good movie to watch. As I watched this movie in my living room, I had my wife sit in the living room and the two of us discussed the movie, and both of us enjoyed it. We thought of all the things that did not make this movie accurate, and most of them actually came true. We laughed, and at times we would both feel a bit like we were standing in front of the Fuhrer, or I guess Hitler should be called, and the events of that time. I would have liked to see more interaction between Hitler and his associates. I think the makers of this movie had their heart in the right place. This story really touched my heart, because this was what the early Germans of that day would have gone through. They would have been forced to make their first choice. Hitler's personality has always interested me. I read a book about the man and what drives him and how he gets himself into fights and I just wondered what made him different from others. I wondered what made him make that first choice. He did not seem to be like any other human, because that first step he made and then followed up was something that seemed to be foreign to others. It seems that his mother influenced him a great deal before he was born and after he was born.\n\nHitler (or more precisely Fritz) as he was called, was born on 20th April, 1889, in Graz, Austria. His father Alois was a farmer, and his mother, Klara, was a waitress in a butcher shop in Graz. Alois died in 1899 and Klara then took in Fritz and brought him up. Fritz attended school in Graz until the age of 11, because his mother had to work and Fritz had to work with his father as well. In 1905, she gave her son the nickname Adolf, because the boy was always called Fritz after two years of being with his mother.\n\n1910 Adolph Hitler joins the Austrian National Socialist party and he is not impressed with it. He doesn't agree with the way the party acts and the way they have their meetings. One day in his opinion, the party did nothing for the country, and didn't even work in favor of the workers and poor people. Although most people in Nazi Germany hated the Nazi party, Hitler was one of his followers. He was told that most of his friends and classmates disliked the Nazis, but in 1912 he becomes leader of the Young Socialists - a branch of the Nazi party. His friends tell him not to become leader, and Hitler takes their advice.\n\nIn the year 1914 the great war between Germany and Austria breaks out, and in September, Fritz's father dies. He was a very good man and he was proud of his son Fritz. Hitler decided to go to Vienna and try to make his mark in the war. His first chance was in August, 1916, when the Russians sent 15,000 men to the Austrians. These men outnumbered the Austrians, and the Austrians gave way and fled.\n\nBefore the great powers at Versailles, all of the territories were carved up according to the wishes of the victor. The Austrians had been defeated, but they still had to accept the agreement of their neighbor, Romania to make it easier for this neighbor to take the land of the Ukrainians, including the territory which is now Romania. The whole thing took a lot longer than anyone was prepared for. The Austrian economy was still in a state of recovery, but a lot of Austrians had joined the Austro-Hungarian army. This army was never considered anything exceptional, and it was not considered special at Versailles either. Fritz saw nothing wrong with it, and neither did Hitler.\n\nThe main part of this great war on the continent, however, involved Germany. Fritz's job was to lead his troops across the Danube River in the south of Austria to fight the people he disliked, but it didn't take him long to feel that it was for the best and for the country itself. Austria lost the war, and the Austrians were forced to cede land to the Germans. The country's government had to agree to this.\n\nThis war was a great loss for Austria. It had lost a great amount of land and resources, and it lost a lot of people, so it was one of the poorest countries remaining in the world. Fritz himself did not go", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "standard order - disorder phase transition in the ising model\n\nFirst, we review the phase transition observed in some simple lattice models [@Lee]. The Hamiltonian is: $$\\begin{aligned}\nH=-J\\sum_{<i,j>}S_i S_j + h\\sum_i S_i\\end{aligned}$$ where $J > 0$ is coupling constant and $h$ is external bias field. A local field $f_i=-S_j$ is applied to one site $i$ in the system. The model with $J>0.5h$ (antiferromagnetic model) undergoes a first order transition, between two phases – ordered and disordered. But if $J<0.5h$ (ferromagnetic model) the system shows no transition. That means the disorder phase transition is missing.\n\nWe would like to apply this model to study disorder induced first order transition of Ising model on a disordered cubic lattice. Ising model on such a lattice shows a continuous disorder induced phase transition [@FisherPRB1984]. But this model suffers from a critical slowing down, which prevents the system to equilibrate [@LubchenkoNatPhy2005]. Another interesting model is the $2d$ $q=8$ Potts model. Unlike the Ising model it has more than one critical temperature. On a square lattice, at low temperature, there is a transition from anti-ferromagnetically ordered, disordered phase and at higher temperature (which is the same as for the Ising model) there is a thermal transition from ferromagnetically ordered, disordered phase. [@WuPRL2005; @WuSciRep2011]. We would like to have a new model, exhibiting the disorder induced first order phase transition.\n\nNow, we introduce a disordered Ising model on triangular and square lattices. On triangular lattice, the Hamiltonian is: $$\\begin{aligned}\nH=-J\\sum_{<i,j>^\\ast-r\\delta_i}S_iS_j+h\\sum_i S_i \\end{aligned}$$ where $J=J^\\ast+d_0S_z^2$ (we have introduced a small perturbation proportional to $d_0$ to overcome the critical slowing down problem) and $\\delta_i$ represents the nearest and next-nearest neighbor. $S_z$ is the spin in $z$ axis. $r$ represents coordination number, defined as $r=2$ (each site have four nearest neighbors: 2, 2 and 1, 1). On a square lattice the Hamiltonian is: $$\\begin{aligned}\nH=-J\\sum_{<i,j>^\\ast}S_iS_j+h\\sum_i S_i+K\\sum_{ij}Z_0(r_{ij})\\end{aligned}$$ $Z_0(r)$ represents the disordered structure factor $$\\begin{aligned}\nZ_0(r)=2\\{(1-\\cos(\\theta))+\\cos r\\}\\end{aligned}$$ $r=r_{ij}$ is distance between the nearest neighbors and the lattice point $i$ and $j$ are fixed in this model (we do not have any dynamic disorder in lattice model). On a square lattice we have: $$\\begin{aligned}\nZ_0(r)=2(1-(1+\\cos r/2)^2)\\end{aligned}$$ where the nearest-neighbor distances are $2$ and $3$ in triangular and cubic lattices, respectively.\n\nWe take periodic boundary condition. To determine the nature of the phase transition, we vary both $J$ and $h$ and determine the system magnetization (in a linear-log plot), as in other lattice models, at critical temperatures in different situations. We also perform energy histogram method for further confirmation. When $J=0$, $h=0$, we choose all the spins anti-parallel as ‘-1’ (ferromagnetic). All other spins are parallel to each other, i.e., in a ‘+1’ configuration (anti-ferromagnetic). The system starts off as disordered phase. As an external field $h$ is applied gradually, we notice that for sufficiently small $h$, the magnetization abruptly changes from one value to the other, but does not go smoothly (continuously) between them. If $h=0$, the system is completely anti-ferromagnetic, while $h>0.0$ favors one of the spin directions. As ‘h’ is increased from 0.1", "label": "gptj"}

You should work on your comfort level.\"\n\nThe company also talked about the importance of expanding its footprint in the market in India and the need to attract new customers across all age groups. \"Our objective is to become a $5-billion company in the next five years,\" Lau said.\n\nOnePlus has announced the OnePlus 4T, which will use the same 6.41-inch AMOLED Infinity display and Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset as the OnePlus 5, but with a smaller battery at 3,030mAh. Unfortunately, there are no images of the OnePlus 4T available on the device's website, but Lau says it can be expected to get a dual front-facing speaker and OnePlus' gradient finish. Other highlights include an updated front-facing camera with improved selfies and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Lau did mention that the OnePlus 5T is on its way with a bigger battery, but didn't have anything substantial to reveal.\n\nIt seems like there are two main camps of user when it comes to the OnePlus 5. On the one hand, you have those that have to live with it and will be sticking with an outdated OnePlus phone no matter what. The OnePlus 5 has been on Android for several weeks now and so, for a device of that level, the lack of new Android features is a problem. On the other hand, users are using it as their daily driver and as an upgraded product from OnePlus' previous models. For us here at ZdNet, we fall into the latter category given that our OnePlus 3 was our day-to-day device.\n\nOnePlus founder and CEO Pete Lau recently told ZDNet that the OnePlus 5 is the best phone on the market with \"the best hardware you've ever seen, the best software you've ever seen\". The OnePlus 5 even comes with \"all-new hardware improvements and the best software, the best software you've ever seen\" - he says this while showing off a new model of the phone called the OnePlus 5T.\n\nIs it worth getting the OnePlus 5T over the regular model? Lau said: \"If you are just looking for the better camera, definitely get the OnePlus 5T. You won't be disappointed.\"\n\nThe OnePlus 3 is going to get an Android Nougat update in the first quarter of next year, even as its successor, the 5, is about to be launched. The software upgrade comes as the company announced that it has set up an Android Beta group where beta testers from around the world are invited to submit their ideas to the product team. Lau said, \"We are putting the entire software behind a beta for you guys to check out and share any feedback...\n\nIn all of its four years in the market, OnePlus has always been a fan of Android. While the company was at the launch of Moto G5 and M5, Peter and his team were working on the OnePlus 5, which was officially announced as early as May. Just after six months since the launch of the 5, the OnePlus 5 is finally getting Android 7.0 Nougat, the current and official version of Android.\n\nThe new OS will be launched with Android 7.0 Nougat, as per the sources, and will arrive on the OnePlus 5", "label": "gptj"}

I wouldn't want to be in the position of any of the characters and I certainly wouldn't be looking back for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe movie uses a few devices that are well known in movies. There is a mysterious stranger who is being watched by the characters. There is an appearance of someone who has died long ago on the screen.

Vampires are a force in public office, in the Senate!\"\n\nThe movie is about the struggle between a vampire and humans. There are many scenes that you will either love or hate. The vampire has a very unique personality, one that is almost a caricature, but it is quite effective in giving him more depth.\n\nHeinlein is a really good writer and if you have ever read anything by him, you will notice it is very easy to follow the story.

There are several high-strength steel grades for which demand exceeds production and this situation is even getting worse. One such grade is A-50 of the ASTM standard alloy (A36) for which demand is about 30% of total global production. The main markets for this grade of steel are those industries which require high-strength, high-alloy and highly corrosion resistant materials for construction such as bridges, high-rise buildings and naval applications.\\[[@CIT4][@CIT5]\\] In the case of naval applications, the A-50 steel comprises the basic high-strength platform for new nuclear marine vessels. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) has stated that the new American nuclear-powered submarines should be built of this type of material.\\[[@CIT6]\\] However, the demand of the stainless grade from the domestic industry is about 400,000 tons per year. The major challenge for the sector in recent years is to increase the domestic production of such high-strength material.\n\nThere has been considerable research in recent times aimed at improving the properties of iron in order to meet the changing economic demands of the steel industry. New steel grades with improved machinability, corrosion resistance and weldablility have been developed. The new grades of steel have come up with several advantages in comparison with the older grades.\\[[@CIT6][@CIT7]\\] To cite a few of the advances over the past few years, the corrosion resistance has been enhanced in steels by the addition of nickel and molybdenum, hence the name NiMo; higher carbon steel grades with improved grain size by the addition of silicon; improved machinability and toughness of stainless steel by addition of chromium for instance stainless type 304 steel, for which the austenitic and ferritic grades are the major ones; improvements in machinability by the addition of aluminum to increase thermal conductivity, which helps in better heat-treat; and improved structural performance by addition of tungsten in steel grades (A, X and P) that are commonly used in aircraft, automobiles and oil industry.\n\nThere are several methods of metallurgical control for improving the properties of steel; the following are the various approaches being followed by researchers, suppliers or industries to control the properties of steel.\n\nIn the case of the grade A-50 steel, there has been considerable research on the following parameters. Since the grade has an ultra-low carbon content, it is very brittle. As a countermeasure, the ductility and toughness has been enhanced through the addition of several elements like nickel, molybdenum, chromium or tungsten in the steel. There are several other methods such as casting with alloying additions, welding, heat treatment and rolling etc. which have been used to enhance strength of A-50 grade steel. It is the most widely used material for the manufacture of steel products like heavy duty machineries, power transmission gears, pumps, marine applications, railway axle standards, marine propulsion systems, nuclear applications etc.\n\nIn another approach of controlling the properties of steel, metallization of the steel has found wide application in the past few years since it has been", "label": "gptj"}

The main theorem in Section \\[s4\\] states that ${B(T, R)}\\setminus \\mathring{B(T, R)}_0$ has the same topological property with the one in [@F], which implies that Kähler angles of $B(T, R)\\setminus \\mathring{B(T, R)}_0$ are constant. Then we conjecture that the similar statement hold for general toric bundles $M_P$ as shown in Theorem \\[mthm2\\]. In Section \\[s6\\], we use $D_{X\\times X}$ to denote the diagonal embedding $X\\rightarrow X\\times X$. It is an interesting problem to understand the image of the projection $M_P\\setminus\\mathring{B(T, R)}_0\\rightarrow M_P$. At least, one knows the image contains some “horizontal\" divisor, which does not seem to be the diagonal embedding.\n\nKähler angle of a toric surface {#s1}\n===============================\n\nWe shall begin with the toric surfaces. First of all, it is well known that a compact Kähler surface $S$ is a toric surface except 0-dimentional ones(Example \\[exm1\\]). Let $M_S=\\mathbb{Z}^2$ be the lattice of one-cycles. The corresponding lattice can also be obtained by taking the primitive generating vectors of the ray generators of a maximal cone $\\sigma$ in a fan associated with $S$(in toric case, it is the one-skeleton of a fan in $N$). We denote $U=(-1, -1)$, $V=(-1, 1), ~W= (-1, 1)$ the primitive lattice vectors. Let $u_S$ be the corresponding class in $H^{1,1}$, then $(1, 1)= u_S^{\\vee} + u_S$. For any toric surface with fan $\\mathcal{S}$, the following equation holds in Equation $(\\star)$, $$\\label{kahlerangle}\n \\tan\\beta = \\frac{|N_S| \\frac{1}{u_S} }{ |G_S| \\frac{1}{u_S^{\\vee}}}.$$ where $\\beta$ is the Kähler angle of $S$, and $|N_S|, |G_S|$ represent the area(resp. number of edges) of $\\sigma$ and the fundamental group(resp. number of faces/gons) of $\\sigma$, $u_S$ is the generator of $\\sigma$, resp. $\\beta$ is the Kähler angle of $S$, resp. ${\\beta^{\\prime}}$ is the Kähler angle of $S^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe formula (\\[kahlerangle\\]) is obtained by observing Kähler angles of toric domains and then it is extended to general surfaces. The computation is complicated: since the equation (\\[kahlerangle\\]) needs both the number of edges and faces/gons, in order to understand the geometric meaning of such a decomposition, one needs to understand how this numbers distribute. To illustrate this point of view, we list two examples from [@O2]. For a complete rational surface $S$(i.e., all the boundary divisors of $S$ are in $G(S)$[^1]), $|F_S|=|B_S|$ for $|E_S|$ boundary divisors.

{"text": "The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla, as seen in this image from the Ctenophora Consortium. Ctenophores include all organisms whose body consists chiefly or solely of a large membrane-enclosed cell, and they are the only known animals that exhibit true coelotyes.\n\nThe word “ctenophore” comes from an ancient Greek word meaning “one covered in tentacles,” with a capital “C”. Ctenophores can be either animals or plants, with approximately 35 known species of ctenophores from every major body of water on the planet. Ctenophores are often referred to as comb jellies, sea gooseberries, or “branched jelly fish.” While that description seems accurate, the body shapes are often quite different from the body shapes of jellyfish. For example, many species of ctenophores are soft and thin, and often lack a bell-type rhopalium. They can vary greatly in size from a few millimeters to many meters across, with even the largest known individuals much smaller than a meter across. But like jellyfish, ctenophores are generally soft bodied and lack internal skeletons, although there are a few exceptions (e.g. cydippid ctenophores).\n\nCtenophores are very diverse and have a variety of unusual features, with many species having bizarre anatomy, unusual behavior, or both. Some species live on the ocean bottom, never swimming, and have no mouthpart or feeding apparatus at all. In sharp contrast some species are capable of amazing, rapid, fluid movement and are often highly agile. For example, we can only guess what behavior may allow the small transparent plankton-eating animal known as a pterioctopus to move swiftly across the surface of the sea, with its entire body covered in tentacles.\n\nDespite the obvious challenges in observing ctenophores, there are a great many interesting aspects of these animals, and a great many of those aspects remain unknown. They are an interesting group of organisms that are much like animals and much like plants, yet much more than both — for example, unlike plants, ctenophores lack chlorophyll and are dependent on symbiotic algae for basic nutrition and energy metabolism. Unlike most animals, they possess no central nervous system and no muscles, yet they can swim rapidly, and exhibit a wide variety of behaviors. The ctenophore Phrynomedusa are reported to respond to physical stimuli and have responses that they are quite aware of having in the past. These features make ctenophores an excellent group for studying how nervous systems work, and understanding how plants work and how plants and animals are related will also benefit.\n\nIn the last couple of decades, the genetic basis of ctenophore development, anatomy, physiology, behavior, sensory organs and other aspects of development have been decoded with significant success. In addition to being a model organism for studying developmental and evolutionary aspects of animal development, ctenophores are of great interest because they are probably the best example yet of a completely separate phylum of metazoan animals, representing another large branch on the evolutionary tree of the Eukaryota. They are also thought to be the sister group to the sponges, an interesting possibility that could have profound implications for understanding the evolution of plants and animals.\n\nIn addition to their developmental, anatomical, and physiological characteristics, ctenophores have very beautiful colors associated with the distribution of two photosynthetic algae associated with each and every ctenophore, an unusual feature that has been shown to have major evolutionary and developmental importance. More recent work is revealing other unusual aspects of ctenophore biology. For example, the recent discovery of large protein clams indicates that ctenophores can make use of very large numbers of large cells of very similar structure to use as a structural part of their bodies. Furthermore, the fact that they have no central nervous system, yet they do exhibit behavior, and the fact that they possess very complex sensory organs, make ctenophores one of the most interesting animals ever studied.\n\nThe most famous (and least understood) ctenophores are the comb jellies, in which there are two large photosynthesizing algae known as photoblasts present at the apex of the tentacles. They are commonly referred to as “comb jellies” for reasons that will become clear. Comb jellies are often quite transparent and are considered to be a prime example of benthic organisms since they cannot swim long distances, and they are never far away from their food supply — both of which are characteristics of many comb jellies.\n\nDespite that, little detailed information is currently available about any of the comb jelly species. The lack of detailed knowledge about comb jelly biology derives from their unusual anatomy at the ctenostyle (“comb�", "label": "gptj"}

The simulations demonstrate that PSS adopts a coil conformation in water with an average radius of gyration in this range and a low mobility, in agreement with the low intrinsic viscosity of this system. The simulations also show that there is no preference for a coil-like conformation at high ionic concentrations. A model structure was developed to describe the interaction between two single ion PSS chains. A theoretical approach was used to study the effect of electrostatics on the structure of the PSS model and the theoretical results are compared with the simulations. As no experimental method exists for the measurement of the radius of gyration of the PSS backbone in aqueous solution over a wide range of ionic strengths, the use of theory in such a situation is a valid alternative.

{"text": "introduction : the apert syndrome is a rare disorder of the ectoderm. the incidence is estimated to be 0.005 per 10 000 births. this condition is seen in the first trimester of pregnancy and is characterized by ectodermal defects of the face and skin. this condition may occur later in pregnancy as well. it is believed to be transmitted by means of autosomal recessive inheritance. apert syndrome is also known as acrocephalopolysynostosis. this is a rare congenital cranial deformity characterized by premature fusion of sutures, malformations of the face, and syndactyly. apert syndrome has an autosomal dominant form, as well. apert syndrome is a major cause of perinatal death and is associated with midline defects of the brain, spinal cord, heart and diaphragm. apert syndrome occurs approximately four years earlier than the diastrophic dysplasia type ii.\n\nclinical findings: apert syndrome may present in several ways with a number of signs, depending on the extent of cranial malformation. symptoms include: facial dysmorphism – small nose, hypertelorism (dilated orbits), low-set, and depressed ears; dysmorphy is also seen in the hands and the extremities; the affected newborn frequently has feeding difficulties. midfacial malformations are not always present and include: hypertelorism, a rounded, depressed, malar, and ocular orbit; a small and narrow nose; a small mouth; thickened, thickened and web-like fingers; joint laxity\n\nsignificance: the main concern with apert syndrome is aortic root dilation. this can compromise the patient’s life expectancy. the condition is progressive and the child may die within two years of delivery.\n\ndiagnosis: apert syndrome should be suspected clinically in any newborn presenting with premature closure of the coronal sutures and the skull. this diagnosis can only be confirmed by genetic testing of the fetus’ blood.\n\ntreatment: the most important aspect of treatment in children with apert syndrome is management of feeding problems and monitoring for growth and development.\n\npaul bennett\n\nbennett’s vital signs\n\ncauses of death in the newborn:\n\nheart failure may be caused by several types of congenital heart disease, including atrial and ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus and aortic coarctation. in addition, aortic overgrowth and dilation of the aortic root may lead to heart failure. aortic dissection or aneurysm of the aorta may lead to blood flow away from the brain and heart and into the aorta. death may also be caused by complications of childbirth, such as uterine rupture, shoulder dystocia and cord prolapse causing asphyxia or injury to the newborn.\n\ntreatment of heart failure: infants will usually die either because of respiratory insufficiency or heart failure. the cause of heart failure in patients with apert syndrome was postulated in 1954 by the author of this condition following three postmortem examinations of a group of patients with a broad spectrum of dysmorphic features. it is caused by two or more anomalies of the interventricular septum leading to a restrictive ventricular function. the diagnosis was established by finding dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism with midline fusion of the median part of the skull. apert syndrome should be suspected clinically in any newborn presenting with premature closure of the coronal sutures and the skull. this diagnosis can only be confirmed by genetic testing of the fetus’ blood. apert syndrome should be considered in any child with congenital midline cranial defects and the features of hypertelorism and a low-set, round chin. apert syndrome is associated with a number of conditions that may also be present (meckel syndrome, diastrophic dysplasia, and some forms of brachytelephalangism). brachydactyly, a distinctive feature of this syndrome, is most common in children with a known syndrome.\n\nsignificance: a number of genes involved in signaling and extracellular matrix production have been implicated as causes of apert syndrome. the genes are part of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling families. in most of the cases, both alleles of the maternal apert allele are inactive and the disease is the result of the absence of a paternal allele. recessive forms of apert syndrome result from mutations in type II collagen (COL II). both the heterozygous and homozygous recessive conditions of apert syndrome result from loss-of-function mutations of the fibronectin 1 (FN1) gene.\n\nmortality rates for premature infants in the first year of life:", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "As is often the case when you attempt to take an old film (in this case the 1936 film) for a spin in high definition, the end result is often, well, interesting, but often messy. As has been the case for past efforts, Dark Knight and The Amazing Spiderman 2 are still going strong, with more movies planned after Batman (this one, The Dark Knight Rises, and the final installment in The Amazing Spiderman franchise, The Amazing Spiderman 3 – not to be confused with its 2012 reboot). After their respective debut this weekend, we decided to see just how well the films would look in high definition.\n\nBefore I get to the nitty-gritty, let us start off with a discussion of how the new Blu-ray technology has worked out so far. For the casual Blu-ray fan, the results for the first three releases have been somewhat mixed. Both of the films on this year’s Best of 2010 list are excellent presentations from the high-resolution discs, with The Dark Knight looking better than ever before and The Last Airbender coming across as both sharp and detailed. However, while there was a lot of discussion before release about how well Dark Knight would translate, even after this film, it must be noted that the new technology is still not as impressive as it could be. That being said, the visual presentation of Dark Knight Rises is impressive, and the new 3D still holds its own. The other major success story of the technology so far has been The Amazing Spiderman 2, which looked spectacularly good both 2D and 3D, for which it was nominated for Best Film Editing.\n\nSpeaking of 3D, with Batman (and, soon, The Dark Knight Rises), it will be interesting to see how it translates, both in terms of technology and the quality of film. The question is whether or not the film will look significantly better in 3D for an audience, or will it look better to those who own the 3D technology required to watch it? That question answers itself, as Batman could easily translate better to a 3D audience, as it would likely look fantastic if it were to appear on a home television, where 3D films are frequently released, but if it appears on a Blu-ray 3D player, it will appear slightly out of its element.\n\nFor now, there is some speculation that even if one of these films were to appear on 3D television before release, it is unlikely that it might actually look better – unless a company like Turner Classic Movies, for example, is willing to convert its broadcasts to high resolution. What does this mean for The Dark Knight Rises? Well, as most would agree, it has a bit of a long run between it and release, and by the time it does, the technology will be even more mature. I’ll be curious to see how the new Blu-ray technology holds up when it comes out and how close Dark Knight looks on release.\n\nAt the present, though, we have two fairly spectacular (if not identical) films from two of the year’s big new releases, with one of them looking much better on Blu-ray. Let’s get to them.The Dark Knight\n\nRelease Date: Friday, November 20th\n\nAs a fan of the franchise, and a fan of previous films in the series, I had a lot of expectations heading into this film. After all, the film had to take place in an entirely new era, meaning the characters had to look much different, and as the films’ new director (Chris Nolan) was working with a completely new cast of characters, the opportunity to take a film that was still fresh and reinterpret it in its own way was a great opportunity.\n\nAs someone who hasn’t seen the previous films, most of that is gone at the start, where we see the emergence of one of the main characters, a crimefighter by the name of Batman (Christian Bale), who is trying to find himself outside of Dick Grayson (Michael Cane), his partner and protégé. This film also shows us Bruce Wayne’s new life as one of Gotham’s wealthiest citizens, and his new place in society, much to the annoyance of Thomas Elliot (Morgan Freeman), who tries to have him return to the world of crimefighting.\n\nAs noted above, the first ten minutes of this film are the most interesting, as the new film jumps ahead nearly ten years, and Batman and his new partner are both a little older and have moved on from the world of crimefighting. The beginning of this film is also the best place to see the evolution of the character of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) – an extremely complex and sympathetic character, who has a lot of interesting backstory, and is one of the more interesting new characters to come out of this film.\n\nThe Dark Knight is a fairly strong film, and the direction and performances – both old and", "label": "gptj"}

The only other movie worth watching in the series would be \"I Walked With a Zombie\" and it's actually better than this.\n\nI am a big fan of the \"B\" and \"A\" movies.\nI enjoyed this one so much I bought the dvd just so I could see it again.\nI watched it last night with my wife and son and boy were we all amused.\nI would like to see it again with other family members but I doubt if I ever will.\nThe picture is terrific, but it does have some problems due to the story.\nIn short, I thought it was a very funny movie and one I would be proud to own as a DVD.\nThe only negative is that I can't stand the idea of seeing what has been edited from it.\nI think most people will have no trouble with this one unless they have a very serious distaste for anything that smacks of the past.\n\nMy first exposure to the \"B\" and \"A\" movies was right with this one. I am a huge fan of the original series, and this was a huge treat for my wife and I (and our 2 young sons). The humor is very good, and the actors were perfect. The only thing was that they were playing on TV in the early '60's and I don't remember all the references. I'm sure it will be fine with any pre-middle school children though.\n\nAfter the success of the original Planet of the Apes, director Franklin J. Schaffner went even further in a sequel with Battle for the Planet of the Apes in 1973. A more realistic portrayal of the apes, the film was made without a \"talking gorilla\" at the core of the plot; as well as some of the most memorable aspects of the original, as far as continuity...\n\nThe film opens with the main protagonists – Dr. Franklin \"Frank\" Thorne (Roddy McDowall) and his wife, Judy. Frank's wife just recently discovered that he is, in fact, an ape. Her friends tell her that he really is an ape, but she will not believe it. Then, Frank is called away on an errand by the head of the Department of Science on Earth, Mr. John P. Braddock (Ralph Richardson). His wife, Mrs. Braddock (Marjie Bennham), calls Judy and asks for Frank to come get her car, which is stuck in the mud. When Frank arrives, he finds that his wife has been abducted by the apes. While Frank and Judy's friends search on the trail left behind, they eventually find Mrs. Braddock's car, but not Mrs. Braddock; the only thing they find is an ape's footprint. A rescue team led by Lt. Virgil Cole (Cesar Romero) and a tracker come across them. They tell Frank not to worry, Mrs. Braddock will be fine.\n\n\"Virgil knows more about apes as an officer than anybody else on this expedition. He's been in the army and knows them well. He should be able to tell you.\"\n\n\"What's their status?\"\n\nThe leader of the apes, Caesar (Charlton Heston) and his second in command, Milo (James Franciscus), are being trailed by a sniper team. They catch up at an impassable waterfall that is their home. A fight breaks out when the humans show up, and the apes have to fight one of their own people who is on their side, a fellow who has been captured and given as food.\n\nThe apes escape at night in the middle of a storm, but Milo catches up with them again. Caesar leads them to a large patch of water – their \"waterfall\" in the movie. As they get closer, Frank and his team hear noises and see movement around them. When the apes arrive, it's Caesar and Milo who explain to Frank and his team that the apes are trying to cross the ocean. They can't stay on their side of the ocean; they want to go to the other side, where they have been, where there is water on both sides of the continents.\n\n\"But what's it like there? Do you know?\"\n\nThe apes have been told (or they have learned on their own) that the humans are a great deal worse than the apes – but that things will get better when they reach the other side", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "The Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine. These were Trier, Cologne, Bonn, Mainz, and Worms. The fifth base, Cologne, was established by Julius Caesar, who was given the honor to place the first stone as dedication on his new fortress.\n\nCaesar’s new fortress was the first attempt by the Romans to permanently establish a military fortress on European soil because until that time the Romans always used fortresses to protect themselves against the various indigenous forces. After the Roman army conquered a new territory, they established a new city and fortified it with an army to hold it for the Roman legions. The Romans built more than 150 forts in the Germanic regions of Pannonia, Moesia, and Germania, some of which are still visible today.\n\nThe earliest traces of occupation along the Rhine were found in Lower Germania, in a village called Unver near Lüttfeld, and in a Roman military base at Castel Waldau. After the Romans conquered that area, they found many German tribes, and they were forced to send a garrison to keep guard over them.\n\nThe Roman general and politician Flavius Cornelius Severus, who led the Roman legions in Pannonia, was one of those German who conquered Lower Germania. He defeated the Suebi, a Germanic people north of the Rhine, and he went on to hold several German forts. Many German forts were built after he was promoted to the command of the Fifth legion and the Emperor Trajan made him the new Roman governor of Lower Germany.\n\nThe first forts were built as temporary positions for the Roman armies, but many of them were constructed in a manner that would stand the test of time. Roman forts were designed to survive a long period of time, even during a war between two forces—they were intended to resist a long siege.\n\nThe Romans were very determined not to leave any area they had conquered. That is the reason why they took great care with the construction of Fort VII on the Rhine, which was constructed as a secure stronghold to protect the Roman forces located on the opposite bank. The Rhine was the border between two different regions, so Roman settlements, forts, and military bases were frequently separated into two separate countries as they went up the Rhine river.\n\nFort VII was built between modern day Cologne and Mainz. According to historians, it was the most important Roman base on the Rhine River. Today, the area is called Rheinmose (“Rhine mouse”). The Romans kept 10 cohorts in the military base for a long time, more than two centuries. This is a unique and impressive record; this military base was used by the Romans throughout two centuries without the need for any sort of major military operations to keep it standing.\n\nAt the start of the 3rd century, Fort VII was a civilian settlement. The Rhine was the border between Roman and Germanic people. The Romans had conquered this area from some Germanic tribes, but they allowed a certain number of tribes to remain. The Romans used Roman names, like Castellum, for the remaining Germanic villages or towns. Roman names for towns, like Cologne, Mainz, or Worms, were also used.\n\nOver time, the population of people living on either side of the Rhine changed, and some people—of different tribes lived in the two towns. Those who were Germanic people were named after their homeland and used different dialects from those who had moved into the area. This brought the border between the two sides as they traveled further into the Rhine River.\n\nAs the population changed, the government of the Roman Empire also changed. Emperor Domitian ordered the establishment of military bases at the German towns along the Rhine. These military bases were used to keep an eye on the German tribes who were living across the river. At the beginning of the 3rd century, Fort VII was converted into an administrative center or an army encampment, because the Empire felt that the town was at risk of becoming too Germanic. The Emperor made Cologne the capital of the Roman empire and divided some of the Germanic tribes on the Rhine into four different legions and divided their area into four regions.\n\nAfter those four legions were established, they had a better ability to protect the Empire. The Emperor knew that they could no longer use these military bases along the Rhine. It was also necessary to establish another town just for administrative purposes because the Empire was becoming too large, and Fort VII just wasn’t enough to sustain a large military power. In other words, the Empire needed smaller fortresses to govern the local Germanic tribes who were being controlled by the Emperor. Fort VII needed to be divided into smaller structures for the Empire to sustain large scale military control.\n\nThe Emperor decided to split the fort into smaller military bases that would each look after one German", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water with a heat source derived from the decay of radioactive material. As is known in the art, the radioactive material is contained in reactor cores or fuel element assemblies of a boiling water reactor. Typically, the cores or assemblies contain approximately equal amounts of a soluble and insoluble fissionable material, such as uranium or plutonium. While the exact ratio can change, it is generally believed to be approximately 3 parts uranium 235, approximately 1 part uranium 238, and approximately 4 parts fission products including some isotopes of xenon, argon, krypton, polonium, bromine, sulfur and iodine. In the reactor, fission of the uranium and plutonium occurs such that the heat source is contained in a large pool of water, or in alternate words, a large volume of liquid water.\nAs the reactor core and fuel element assemblies are used, they are removed from service for refueling. During this process, the fuel element assemblies are transferred to a drywell. In this process, all of the water is drained from the fuel element assemblies or cores, leaving only the depleted fuel cores. However, some of the depleted fuel cores contain water trapped in the structure of the fuel elements in the form of a film that has formed on the surfaces of the fuel pellets, cladding tubes, and spacers between the fuel pellets and/or between the cladding tubes. This is because the core does not remain isolated during the service interval. Rather, some water is absorbed into the fuel pellets, causing them to swell. Furthermore, some water is absorbed into the cladding tubes and spacers. Although the exact reason why this film is established is not completely understood, it is believed that the film is formed as a consequence of an azeotropic dehydration reaction of water from the steam voids surrounding the fuel pellets and the fuel elements. The term “steam voids” is used herein to mean regions where steam has not yet been absorbed by the fuel elements.\nThe film that forms tends to be rather thick, on the order of thousands of microns or more. In order to remove the cladding and the fuel pellets and their cladding with the film left on them, the cladding tubes and fuel pellets are separated from the depleted fuel cores. Therefore the water absorbed into the cladding tubes and the fuel pellets is allowed to evaporate, and the absorbed water is then allowed to separate from the walls of the cladding tubes and the fuel pellets. It should be kept in mind that the water absorbed into the fuel pellets and cladding tubes is already quite concentrated and there is a high solubility for water in many metals, so the film is in the form of a solution of the metal and absorbed water. While it is preferred to remove the water from a single fuel element, it is sometimes necessary to separate the cladding from one or more multiple cladding tube segments and then remove the cladding tubes with the absorbed water left on them from a single fuel element. In order to remove the cladding with water from the fuel pellets and spacer as thoroughly as possible, it is desirable to perform the separation by first rinsing the fuel pellets and spacers that were not originally immersed in the fuel pool of the reactor core using water. Some water may also be injected into the drywell to further remove the absorbed water, although the amount of water necessary for this procedure is not always obvious or predictable.\nWhile some drywashing and other processes for removing the absorbed water from the cladding tubes and the fuel pellets can effectively remove the film to an extent, the film that is left is very adhesive. It tends to bond strongly to other surfaces, such as to the side of the drywell that it is intended to clean. As a result, the film that builds up forms a relatively hard, very adherent bond to other materials.\nAn attempt to remove the film formed between the fuel pellets and the cladding tubes and the fuel pellets and the spacers was attempted using acid cleaning techniques. This is because it is known that many metals, both ferrous and non-ferrous, can be dissolved by using sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid tends to dissolve the cladding tubes, the spacers, and the fuel pellets and their cladding. However, the strong acid is not selective enough. In addition, it is not able to dissolve the absorbed water sufficiently. The acid also destroys or severely degrades the physical and chemical structure of the metal surfaces that it contacts. In essence, acid cleaning removes the cladding tubes, the spacers, and the fuel pellets and their cladding as a whole. It is then sometimes necessary to refabricate some of the components before they can be returned to the reactor core.\nIn order to prevent the film from building up on other surfaces, it has been known to use water jet washing techniques for removing the film. One such technique is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the same day that saw me catch up with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at the cinema, this movie is one that has always intrigued me. It isn't the story I expected from looking at the artwork, which is perhaps down to the fact that it's been almost 50 years since I first saw it and my memory has faded a bit from the movie. I find it amazing, in fact, that Walt ever approved this movie, which was made way before the days of advanced animatronics and CG. It looks so very, very old-school, yet despite that, it seems to speak to a very early age and time.\n\nThis movie takes place in a place we all think we've been in the movie at some point in time, but there is little evidence to suggest we have ever been there. In this particular movie, when people are walking through the town at night, it's so dark there that all we can see in the way of objects are the forms and shadows of people and objects.\n\nTo the young and innocent audience that was in the cinema, the images on the screen will have been the reality of this night time situation, an environment where little can or does happen and things that are hidden are revealed, including the body of a little girl.\n\nThe night in question, is what was the night that the little girl ran through the streets of a dark and dreary town with the purpose of searching for her friends that had gone out for a walk and were never seen again. The scene is then, set in one of the many towns around this world, where the citizens would have watched, with great concern, as the night turned into day, where it turned into day, where it turned into day, and the little girl never returned. In one of the local towns, there was a young boy from a large family, whose parents had long since departed to another country. With his young sister by his side, he wandered aimlessly around town, thinking about the night but unable to recollect anything of that night that had passed, when suddenly, they were approached by a small girl who was frightened and upset.\n\nOn reaching them she was unable to talk so they gave her an apple, the traditional good luck charm of the movie. It seems the town was filled with the idea that the apple and the night were somehow linked, so maybe, they could get their help to find the other children, that this was indeed their lucky charm. Without asking if they knew where their children were, the girl and the young boy started out together, looking in the dark, in search of the missing children.\n\nWhat this movie tells us is perhaps how powerful childhood is in our life and how something as simple and innocent as an apple can mean so, so much, and why. We're given a chance to see and feel the power over fear that children posses and perhaps the strength we possess over life and our own decisions. All children are born as children, and children have always existed, right from the beginning of time. We can see this concept throughout history, and in the film, there are many things that remind the viewers that this is just a very, very, very, very, very, very early point in history with the use of characters similar to very old, very, very, very, very, very early people.\n\nI really like this movie (even if I did miss some key parts). It's kind of a dark movie and I would love to watch it again with all of the parts in. The fact it is scary doesn't really bother me, and is something that just makes it even stronger for me. But I do wish the ending with the old people and the two younger girls was longer. The ending is kinda weird, but I don't want to spoil anything! haha!\n\nAnyway, I really like this movie. It's a very beautiful film, to be perfectly honest with you.\n\nI'm feeling so inspired today to keep writing here on the site and keep it going, so keep coming back!\n\nI recently found myself being a bit of a pessimist in regards to the future of the UK TV industry and it is quite depressing to think about. Just like the last time I was pessimistic about things, I've been thinking about it a lot in recent days and I found myself looking at the many reasons why things are going the way they are and feeling quite angry!\n\nThe first thing I'm most annoyed about is that a show called \"EastEnders\" is currently in a place where an industry needs to make a special effort to make it work. There was a special programme on the Discovery Channel called \"The Real Hustle\" and we used to love watching it! It's a programme where four young, smart, professional and very ambitious people had to live in a small, confined, and challenging environment for three months of their choice.

{"text": "\"Ethiopian Jews are Israeli Jews in every way,\" said Roni Bienstock, an Israeli academic researching the history of Ethiopia and Jewish culture, adding that there was a \"direct ethnic correlation\" between Israeli Jews and Ethiopians who \"have the same language and share almost the same religion.\"\n\nAnthropologists, however, have called the term \"out of line with reality\" in part because there is little physical connection between Ethiopia and Israel.\n\nIsraeli author and journalist Idan D'Ami has said Ethiopia, like Morocco and Jordan, \"has historically been the home of the Jew.\"\n\n\"It's very hard to say these people are not Jewish,\" he said. \"They are the Jews of the Jews.\"\n\nYet, a handful of Jewish communities have existed in Ethiopia during the course of their history. There are about 1,000 Jews worldwide today, according to the Washington Office on Israel, including a few hundred Israelis in Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. Many of those Israelis are Holocaust survivors. They live within a few minutes' drive on a quiet main road of Addis Ababa's neighborhood of Ketu. Their last name -- Solomon -- is not uncommon among the Jewish population.\n\nIsraeli Jews in Addis Ababa do not know their family history, having been dispersed by the Holocaust and escaping postwar persecution in Europe, according to Israeli author and journalist Idan D'Ami.\n\n\"When I'm asked, 'Where are you from?' I never have an answer,\" he said.\n\nThe few Ethiopian Jews who still remain in the region are confined to the capital. But they hope to one day integrate into the community there. About 150 of them are learning Hebrew and have their own local institutions for Jewish learning.\n\nSolomon, 65, was told when he was very young that his forefathers were Jewish. He remembers a teacher once asking his mother to go on a trip to Israel with one of the class' older children, so they could learn about the country.\n\n\"I heard her tell the child, 'I'm going with you,' and they went,\" Solomon said, smiling.\n\nOne of his friends also told him that his grandmother was Jewish, Solomon remembered. Another friend recalled that his brother had brought him a pair of gold rings before the war, which Solomon assumed were ceremonial, not religious.\n\nSolomon was born to a Christian family in a small village about 50 kilo meters west of Addis Ababa. During the Second World War, he and his family fled with the British. They never went back to Ethiopia.\n\nEven though few Jews live in Ethiopia today, a Hebrew translation of the Tanakh, the Jewish Bible, was published there in 1968, and Ethiopian Jewry still uses the Ethiopian calendar, which is based on the lunar calendar.\n\n\"We always had the feeling we were Jews,\" Solomon said.\n\nD'Ami, whose own family fled Ethiopia during the Holocaust, lives with the feeling that he's Jewish. But despite living as an Israeli, he doesn't understand the Ethiopian experience or have firsthand knowledge of being Ethiopian.\n\nEthiopia \"didn't need us to have a Jewish community,\" he said. \"No one ever thought Ethiopia would be a haven for Jews.\"\n\nToday, Israelis who have their roots in Ethiopia -- even those who aren't Jewish by birth -- are part of that community.\n\n\"I am Ethiopian, even though I don't have a drop of Ethiopian blood,\" said Rachel, 23, studying for a master's degree in medical anthropology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\n\n\"I grew up here,\" she said, holding her hand atop her head as she spoke. \"I was brought up an American.\"\n\nThis is what people in Addis Ababa also believe about their community. Rachel's family moved from Ethiopia to Israel and later returned. Since then, she has seen herself in the Ethiopian community.\n\n\"Even though I feel Ethiopian only because of the culture, I still identify myself as Israeli,\" she said proudly, as another American girl -- with dyed red hair -- turned around and looked on curiously.\n\n\"We are all Ethiopian by nature,\" said one young woman who declined to give her name.\n\nIn the past, many Ethiopians didn't want to be Israeli because they associated Israeli culture with a Westernization they said came first from the British. In recent years, though, Israeli culture as expressed by Ethiopians was changing.\n\nAn Israeli friend once told her that Israel was a Jewish country, and it showed the country's openness to accept all peoples and cultures from around the world. The country celebrated Christmas for the first time in 1996. A handful of Israeli churches are now open in Ethiopia, a church spokeswoman told ABC News. Ethiopian Israeli citizens are allowed to visit them. On New Year's Eve this year, millions of Ethiopians danced around bonfires all around the country, dressed in traditional garbs.\n\n\"When", "label": "gptj"}

Little is known about cognitive abilities in the subclinical stage of the disease. The aims of this study were to (i) analyze the pattern of cognitive alterations during the progression of cirrhosis, and (ii) evaluate the effects of blood sugar control in this condition.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe attentional and executive disorders associated with cirrhosis were estimated in a sample of 19 patients. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Trail Making Test A and B, Rey-Osterrieth Complex figure, Stroop Color/Word Test, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe patients exhibited impairment on several clinical tests, including the number of total errors on the Trail Making Test (P = 0.001) and Stroop words test (P = 0.01), and the number of perseverations on the Rey complex figure (P = 0.05). A significant positive correlation was found among total errors and perseverative responses on the Trail Making Test (r = 0.72; P = 0.002) and a negative correlation was found between the age of onset of cirrhosis and the number of errors on the Stroop test (r = -0.66; P = 0.003). The patients in the experimental group had significantly fewer errors on the Stroop test (4.4 ± 1.3 versus 11.4 ± 3.8, respectively; P < 0.0001) and total errors on the Trail Making Test B (28.8 ± 8.1 versus 36.6 ± 9.6, respectively) than those in the placebo group.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe show a significant reduction in the cognitive errors associated with both attention and executive processes in the subclinical stage of cirrhosis that is mediated by tight blood sugar control. These data demonstrate the need for controlled glucose administration to protect against the neurotoxic and antinithetic effects of HE.", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "Woodfox was part of the group known as the \"Angola Three\" which was arrested in 1973 after being accused of aiding the Cuban communist regime in its efforts to destabilize Angola's government. Their charges were never upheld, and an appeal was rejected in 1976. In 1978 Fox and his colleague, Joe Remiro were pardoned but Woodfox, along with Robert Harris and Herman Wallace continued to serve their life sentences for the murder of Officer Ford.\n\nIn 1982, a civil lawsuit was filed against the Angola Three at Louisiana's federal district court. The lawsuit called for their immediate release and a retrial. However, neither the Louisiana or the state's federal district court ruled on the suit until more than 20 years later.\n\nIn 2006, the Angola Three was included in a list of inmates deemed eligible for commutation by Louisiana's governor at that time, Kathleen Blanco, who ordered their release. Governor Blanco described their case as \"the saddest in Louisiana history.\"\n\nHowever, the Louisiana Supreme court ruled against Fox, Remiro, and Woodfox's request on April 18, 2012, effectively blocking Fox and Woodfox's attempts to make a return trip home to West Virginia, despite their decades long incarceration and the fact that their convictions were vacated. The ruling was made by the Louisiana Supreme Court unanimously without written opinion. In a separate decision on the same day, a split 5–4 decision from the same court ordered Remiro to be released on a technicality, writing that because Remiro was convicted of an offense committed after December 12, 1972, the date of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Mississippi, he did not benefit from the U.S Supreme Court ruling. The two sides had also reached an out-of-court settlement for $200,000.\n\nWoodfox said the experience was painful:\n\nHe will die in prison. I don't want to say that is the only way, but I think all of us are here for some sort of purpose and the purpose hasn't come yet. There is somebody trying to bring it to pass, but the time isn't ripe. There will be a time for us. I have faith that it will happen in my lifetime, if it happens.\n\nIt is hard to imagine Woodfox's response if he knew he would die soon, said Christopher Hart, Woodfox's brother-in-law:\n\nYou are going to have an old, white, sad man, who has stood in this prison for over 40 years, die in a Louisiana prison because everyone who is a human and has a conscience in this country has the right to have the law of the land be applied to them in the United States of America. It's so ridiculous to me, that the law in Louisiana, in West Virginia, in Virginia — wherever they are — they have the right to apply their constitution to people the same as they are supposed to do in the Constitution of the United States.\n\nIn April 2016, Woodfox became eligible to apply for final discharge. Louisiana Corrections secretary James LeBlanc announced that Fox and Remiro would be eligible to apply for pardons on May 8. However, by May 11, he said that his staff was unable to confirm the eligibility in time, and Fox and Remiro would no longer be able to apply for a pardon. In spite of this reversal, Woodfox again expressed his hope that he would be released. On June 30, LeBlanc stated that two inmates had since been found eligible for the pardon. He called their eligibility \"an important milestone\" in the case, and he hoped it would be the first of many pardons. Both Woodfox and Remiro are still awaiting their commutation, and Fox could make a return journey to his home in West Virginia.\n\nRemiro filed for a writ of habeas corpus on July 27. On August 30, 2016, the New Orleans Orleans district court judge denied the writ, stating that the case was moot:\n\nThis Court is presented only with the question of mootness, and not the merits of applicant's case. Accordingly, the application for writ of habeas corpus is dismissed without prejudice. This decision does not moot the claims that petitioner is raising herein. If petitioner is convicted of any crimes while he remains incarcerated in Louisiana State Penitentiary [sic] (OSP), OSP will be barred from executing a sentence of life imprisonment for his convictions of having committed first-degree murder, and of unauthorized use of a movable because his convictions of those offenses predate the decision of June 9, 2016, in Foster v. U.S.,, — U.S., 135 S. Ct. 1074, 191 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2015). A judgment declaring OSP in violation of the Louisiana Constitution has not been rendered. Thus, OSP remains subject to habeas relief should petitioner's convictions be reversed on appeal or on collateral review. See LA. R.S. 44:1(1). In", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Legally, only non-profit trusts and societies can run schools in Canada. And if any of them get busted trying to hide illegal activity and students behind an educational façade, it's not a crime to be a student at that school – it's a crime only for the school itself to be registered.\n\nBut since there are few or no consequences for the school, and even fewer for the schools' students, there are bound to be more and more of them.\n\nIf someone wants to open a non-profit and non-registered school, all they need is a bank account in their name, a bit of cash to start buying uniforms and supplies, and a phone number that's never registered to anyone. Then they simply send their students – children and teenagers – to the school.\n\nBut if that school is found to be \"illegal,\" where does it end?\n\nIf someone gets busted setting up a school \"in the wild,\" does the bust end it? Does the school get to keep teaching? Does it get to continue using its bank account?\n\nThe law is clear that schools whose existence could be considered \"illegal\" would be banned. It says any school receiving public funds or taxpayer money \"cannot use funds or accept payment for the tuition of students whose primary purpose is to participate in activities or receive instruction contrary to established practices of an educational institution.\"\n\nSo that means a school would be banned if it, in fact, turns out that the students aren't in the classroom, they're actually on a factory line, on a farm, on a prison bed, or doing manual labour.\n\nNow, the school is only considered \"illegal\" if it has a \"primary purpose\" contrary to established practices of an educational institution, which means you shouldn't confuse that with what a school might actually be teaching.\n\nThe law even gets specific: it refers to schools that teach prostitution, or drug use, or weapons or crime or any other illegal activity.\n\nBut these clauses have never been enforced.\n\nEven if a school fails to comply with these rules, the mere existence of the school is not illegal. The law only bars any school receiving government funds or tax money if it teaches things that \"contradict established practices of an educational institution.\" So even if a school fails to comply with one of these illegal-activity restrictions – as long as they're not teaching prostitution or drugs, you couldn't shut it down.\n\nThe school could be shut down, but the students would keep going there. The school may be declared illegal, but the students don't.\n\nNow for anyone who knows a school in the wild – you might as well not mention their location – who could try to shut it down?\n\n\"The education ministry would not be able to intervene, even though they could do so under the law,\" said an insider. \"They could shut it down, but the students are not committing a crime. So that's a big issue.\"\n\nThere's no reason to fear that the new federal government, given that \"the teachers are good and the kids are well off, the families are good,\" will open up the schools.\n\nWhat about the new Conservative government, elected with so many promises to reduce the deficit, with the stated intention of being \"accountable\" to the parents?\n\nThe insider was hopeful about that. \"They're the most fiscally conservative party right now so with their budget, they'd like to do a lot of reordering and make these things better. I think they want to be accountable to parents and parents can see what happened.\n\n\"It makes a lot of sense with the whole'school choice' thing.\n\n\"So parents actually have a choice these days, it's quite a good thing.\"\n\nThe school insider knows a lot about what's going on. \"You just have to talk to teachers and you know what their pay is and what their benefits and stuff like that.\n\nAnd she said, \"the teachers aren't afraid because they know that when they show up to work, they could actually get out and go. So that's pretty good.

{"text": "This movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of a chicken. Viewers are then asked if they can accept that someone could put his hand into a chicken, pull out the chicken's heart, cut it open, and pull it out without having any effect. The answer is \"What? No!\"\n\nAccording to the USDA, \"About 45 million chickens or 16 billion pounds of chicken is consumed by American consumers every year.\"\n\nIn the documentary, they talk about the religious implications of eating meat. On top of this, they say they are also against animal cruelty!\n\nIn this case, the whole production team is vegetarian. One of the staff members even talks about becoming vegetarian! (It's not the same thing as veganism. Not everyone wants to stop eating all animal products. Just stop eating flesh meat).\n\nI will show them, though!!\n\nAnd I will not stop until I see meatless meat just as valid as meat-eating meat. There's a big difference though. When I eat meat, at least I know that the thing I was eating and the thing I had for dinner aren't the same thing.\n\nThe fact that I was eating chicken and the chicken was eating the ground up thing that was on the ground is completely inconsequential. If I can eat chicken and not think twice about it, how can I accept the same thing from an Animal Liberation Front spokesperson?\n\nWhat makes me a real \"animal person\" would be to try and convince them that eating flesh-meat at all is killing.\n\nBut I'm a realist. Even if I were able to convince a person to be a vegetarian, or to at least think about it, I do not expect any of them to ever become a vegetarian. So that's that.\n\nFor the first time in a while, I am having a nice thought.\n\n\"Wow! This guy's nice and sweet, and even though he's a meat-eater, he's actually trying to see that the killing of things is wrong. Way to go, man! That's what I like: someone going out of their way not to hurt animals...\n\nAnd, if some day I ever do come across a vegetarian, I'm not exactly sure whether to try and 'convince' him or just leave him alone and let him enjoy his life.\"\n\n\"And speaking of life...\n\n...There was a time when I was trying to prove to my girlfriend that you could do things for someone and at the same time have him/her be someone else. She thought that if he was trying to prove to her that he could do something for someone else, then he could also stop treating me like a girlfriend.\n\nAnd then I decided to do it. I just decided to make myself a different person, and for the first time that I could remember, I really was happy and at the same time relieved, I was thinking that I was going to live a very easy and natural life.\n\nIt also occurred to me at the same time that there was something else that I was doing for the person. Before, I was trying to prove that she could find herself in me, but once I stopped trying to prove that, I could finally look deeper, and realize that I was doing for her things that I was really good at and that she really needed.\"\n\nLast night I went to get some ramen noodles and some popcorn/cheese.\n\nOn the way in I got some frozen fish, which I put up on the \"To-Do\" list.\n\nAt that point, I got two frozen cod.\n\nSo I went home and made some \"tuna\" nuggets out of one fish and some of the second fish.\n\nSo, I took some fish, and made some meat out of it. I had a really good dinner last night!\n\nAnd I didn't even think about it for a second! Even though it's a somewhat odd combination, or at least the way I cooked it, I didn't think twice about it.\n\nThen I went out this morning and got another fish, which I chopped up on top of bread and made some meat out of it. It was great! Delicious fish.\n\nI will have to remember that idea. I don't know when I would have time to make something like that though!\n\nAs a matter of fact, I have a good dinner tonight. And tomorrow I will do some kind of thing like that. I'll be cooking something on top of popcorn, which we will have with cheese, and then I will take those and put them in a pouch and heat them up.\n\nTomorrow I have something to do, so I may or may not have time to go home and see what we had for dinner tonight.\n\nI guess I will find out in a bit though...\n\nIt's been a while since I've had some \"easy\" type", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Release: Q4, 2000 - Genre: Sports, duh - Console: PS1, NTSC, Retail - The PS1. Nowadays the gaming industry is dominated by the Playstation, but what was the biggest console of our time?\n\nThe year 2000 was quite a big year for Sony, starting with the release of the Playstation. While the Sega Dreamcast and N64 were dominating the market, PlayStation sales were growing and growing. The PlayStation 2 would later become the number one selling console in the world, as we look back on the PS1 it is still a true classic that can still be found in many gamers homes. At the height of Sony's popularity was in the middle of that year of 2000, in December, the gaming genius of Shigeru Miyamoto released the third game in what would be the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Series. The game was an instant success, which had everyone all worked up. Nintendo had created two legend of Zelda's before this. The first Legend of Zelda was Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past where Link was traveling to save the land from the evil Gannon. Ocarina of Time on the other hand, was a story of the princess Zelda traveling on a journey to rescue the sleeping princess on top of the tower known as the Lorule, while her friend Link helps her along his way. In the end everything was completed on her journey, but not before she falls into a deep sleep where she dreamt a secret dream of a man that could not talk. This man had to carry out the true purpose for his being, to wake her up. What would happen when this legendary trio came together? Ocarina of Time was an instant success with gamers of the day.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was also an instant favorite to many non-gamers and anime fans as the story of Link's journey through the Land of the Wind was based on the Japanese children's story of The Legend of Ninten. Although, Nintendo did not do much in the way of marketing Ocarina because of the success they had with the first two games. Although the game was still fairly new, in just a few month's since its release it already sold over 10 million copies. With Nintendo also trying to branch themselves out to other types of games besides those that were popular in the 1980's and 1990's, the company was trying to gain more exposure with their product. If Nintendo was trying to do this, then Sony sure as hell didn't want to be left out. Enter the PS1.\n\nPlayStation, as a company, was a whole new concept of gaming and entertainment. Unlike Sega or Atari, Sony was branching out into the areas of films, cartoons and many other types of media. By the time PlayStation hit the market, it was the dominant console, but when you look at sales numbers from just one year, you'll notice a big difference with Nintendo's sales against Microsoft's.\n\nThe PS1 was a new concept of gaming and also a new concept of entertainment. From the moment the PS1 came out to the world it took Sony the gaming market by storm. PlayStation owners were everywhere. In the time after the first few months and into 2006, there were still over 30 million PlayStation's sold. When the PS2 was released, it was an immediate hit. In the world of video games the PS1 is still one of the biggest and best systems that was ever made.\n\nHere is a look at the Top Rated Games of the PS1:\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 - PS1 - 10/10 - In the years after the 3rd Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Adventure, was released, Sonic was in a slump. All of a sudden, his gameplay was taken back to where they should be. All of a sudden Sega was having real problems making sure they could keep making Sonic games and other franchises, like Ecco the Dolphin. At the time Sonic 2 was Sonic's most recent game. Many gamers were tired of the series, while some, most notably me, still played every Sonic game to date from the arcade versions to the Sega released versions. I had this vision though, that would change Sonic's gameplay. If Sonic the Hedgehog 2 hadn't been my favorite Sonic game, then Sonic 3 would be my favorite Sonic game of all time. Sonic 3 was a big change from the first two games in that Sonic Adventure was a rail shooter, where Sonic would be travelling across a level and he could fly. In Sonic 3, Sonic could actually go right through everything, and at full speed, instead of running away. His game was back to his roots, and it was amazing.\n\nThe last time we had a rail shooter Sonic the Hedgehog game was at the end of 1994 with the release of Sonic 3. But, by the end of the year 2000, this was the first time I got to play such a level. We were on a quest across levels to prevent Chaos", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid. There is not a good option to choose from. It is not a smart film. At best it can be described as sophomoric. The trailer gives no hint that there may be a story beyond \"Two idiots in a relationship fall for a girl they don't know.\" The fact that the title is taken from an ad for a different movie, and not a movie by James Cameron.\n\nThe premise is simple and, while it could be interesting, it is a hard concept to make the viewer care. The characters are morons that the writers don't seem to know. They write a lot of text instead of trying to find out what their characters like/dislike, don't like, dislike, hate, have no opinion about, etc. There are characters that have just enough personality to get them across the screen for a few moments. Even the two lead character have no depth. He is a young nerd in the military with a hard shell and she's the average, overweight, middle-class, high school, slut.\n\nThe story is that the main characters meet at some party. They start going out, but when they start going down a road of commitment, one of them is called up for duty, while the other leaves. It is just there for the girls to get back together and have their life figured out before they go to war. The war scenes never make any sense or go anywhere. Every other female character gets naked and has a relationship or sex scene, so they can make more sex scenes and try to make it better. The military scenes are boring and stupid. They are set in rural Wisconsin and the military doesn't even exist.\n\nThe end feels forced. There is no reason it should be like it was.\n\nWith a premise so ridiculous, it comes out as a pretty mediocre movie. The acting is just poor, and there is a lot of dialogue, which distracts from the actors. The actors really did not do that much. Their facial expressions were limited to showing they didn't like something. The dialog was limited to the few things that needed to be said. It was only in the sex scenes where the actors really had any emotion.\n\nThe movie was pretty badly written and poorly acted. The actors, while competent, had minimal emotional range. It was very predictable. If there is a takeaway from this, it should be that actors should have strong screen presence to make an entire movie worth seeing.\n\nYou know, this has the potential of a decent movie. I'm on board for a second time in my life. I think that James Cameron understands the need to give the audience a strong reason to watch a script that is in the development stages. The movie doesn't try to be a sex comedy. There is no forced romance or contrived events or anything like that. You have an unlikely romance between two morons that takes center stage. What do they like? They like sex, because that's there. Their relationship, outside of sex acts, is about keeping other people from knowing that they're in love. It's a really good concept, one that the audience doesn't even need to be told about. The character relationships are all laid back. You really don't see anybody as a total douchebag.\n\nThe acting is good. The script, the dialog, it is very solid. I see potential. It just needs to be developed. I'm on board for the sequel. James Cameron should consider an audience his number one priority, and he'll get a really good product.\n\nThe first time I saw this movie - I read online the plot (pretty boring too) but never saw it because when I wanted to the TV was blocked on my office (there were all good films)\n\nI saw it again and it was a bit dissapointing, to say the least.\n\nThis time I saw it with friend, but he told me it's the worst one of Cameron's movies so now I'm a bit nervous.\n\nHere is a more interesting plot and the movie is directed by John Singleton (see: BOF...)\n\nA guy named Robert wants to be a cop. He goes to the police academy and is good enough in his studies to get a police department job. After being there for a few years he starts getting into fights and things get even worse when he realizes that he feels more attracted to women and is very homophobic. He quits the force and goes to his father to plead with him and have him talk to the department head and ask to be given another chance. The father won't have it and the department head says that it's a good sign of commitment, \"he's got a family now, he's settled down, he's a man\". The father then gets shot and dies of his wound and Robert wants to quit his job and head to NY, as his ex-mother in law (who has been a very bad influence on", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "His ascent to the post was the climax of a long career, a time when a new generation and a new political culture, both foreign and domestic, were shaping the country and, indeed, world politics for the next half century.\n\nMr. Reagan began his political career in the Goldwater insurgency of 1964 in Sacramento, Calif., a conservative counterculture made up of young people with little experience and a few of their parents.\n\nMr. Reagan, as political analyst David Brog, wrote, “was a small cog in the machinery of a new kind of politics, an electoral system engineered by people who were no longer of the old, dying Republican Party.”\n\nBut he was always loyal to the party, though at times his actions seemed out of step with the political establishment of his day. In 1974, he denounced the Watergate break-in and the ensuing scandal — a direct slap in the face of then-President Richard M. Nixon and the Republican establishment.\n\nBy then, the political environment was being reshaped again. The so-called big-tent Republican Party was dying, replaced by a new generation of politicians and voters who had become increasingly alienated by Republican policies and politics. These new activists and officeholders, such as Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and George W. Bush, were less concerned with ideological purity and more interested in party loyalty than in winning elections. The old-guard Republicans, meanwhile, increasingly gravitated toward the Christian conservatives of the National Conservative Political Action Committee, led by the religious activists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson.\n\nMr. Reagan’s move toward the center in his first presidential bid gave him some credibility with the new voters. That credibility grew when the Reagan administration moved sharply to the center after the Iranian hostages were seized in 1980. By giving amnesty to thousands of prisoners and pardoning Richard M. Nixon, who resigned before his trial, Mr. Reagan seemed to be moving to the same center, only even further to the right. The president did not speak out at all against the Vietnam War until January 1981, and in July 1982, his administration lifted the trade embargo on the Soviet Union.\n\nBut some of his policies proved too extreme even for some of his die-hard supporters. Mr. Reagan’s tax plan, which was so popular that it was adopted by most of the Republican Congress, would cut taxes significantly for the wealthiest two percent of Americans, increasing their share of the national budget. But it cut taxes on the average family roughly in half — something that most politicians, regardless of their ideology, would not have done without losing significant votes.\n\nIn 1982, in order to get his party to go along with him on a massive increase in defense spending and the military budget, Mr. Reagan had to force the Republican leaders to allow an amendment to the budget that took $34 billion away from social programs. As Ronald Reagan told a friend, “It was the biggest goddamned power play I ever saw in my political life. I was amazed at the leadership of the Republican Party.”\n\nWhile Mr. Reagan’s record on defense was mixed, his foreign policy often seemed to reflect simple wishful thinking. In January 1981, he told the American people that the Soviet Union was “the focus of evil in the modern world.” Yet, the following March, as his administration was preparing to invade Grenada, a Reagan administration adviser told The New York Times that no direct link between Mr. Reagan’s call for support in Grenada and his call for a Soviet offensive had been made.\n\nThe Reagan years were a watershed in Washington, as he came to represent not so much the right as the Establishment, though he had a far narrower following inside or outside the country than Nixon or Eisenhower, who had both been nominated by their parties.\n\nThe Reagan administration, like the Reaganites inside the administration and even his core support group inside the party, was very conservative. But it was conservative with an agenda. That agenda was to build a strong military and take measures to restore the country and perhaps the world to full employment and an “economic revival” — even though inflation was rising.\n\nBut Mr. Reagan did not get it all his own way. He had no political machine to help him or to force his policies on reluctant members of Congress, though he did have some powerful friends, most prominently, Senate Minority Leader Robert H. Dole, the Kansas Republican.\n\nAnd by 1981, Mr. Reagan’s once-famed eloquence had faded. He was far more disciplined than he used to be. And his health was beginning to decline.\n\nEven before Mr. Carter’s election, Mr. Reagan’s advisers thought of him as likely to die in the next presidential campaign, his aides say. Mr. Reagan, though, refused to make that assumption official.\n\n“I see myself going on being president for a long,", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "this is the second of a series of papers investigating the influence of the time-dependent inter-elemental interaction that may appear in the case of a finite collection of discrete interacting elements. In this second paper we aim at understanding if and how the time dependence of the interaction influences the evolution of the collective phenomenon of the inter-elemental state described by the instantaneous distribution of the mechanical energy in the system. In doing this, we start from an initial configuration of the system and let it evolve under a discrete time-evolution rule; this is described in more detail in refs [26, 41, 29, 32, 42]. By studying the distribution of the mechanical energy of each element of the system as a function of time, we have made a quantitative analysis aimed at measuring the role of the time-variable of the interaction and its influence on the evolution of the system. In particular, we study how the presence of a time-dependent interaction influences the ability of the system to maintain its original configuration (or, on the contrary, to evolve toward a configuration different from the initial one) at the end of the discrete time-step considered. We study this in the limit of weak interactions, that is for a case in which the interaction is not so strong as to destroy the original configuration of the system. Furthermore, we restrict to the simplest case in which the interaction between two neighboring discrete elements is proportional to the difference of their mechanical energy, and study the impact of this interaction on the evolution of the whole structure. In a future work, we will further consider the effects of a broader class of time-dependent interactions. Finally, we will analyze how the presence of a time-dependent interaction can influence the ability of the system to maintain its initial configuration at the end of the time step considered in the simulation.", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Each year, the southern California area has about 10,000 earthquakes. Yet only about 1 percent are so large that they’re felt all over the world and have the potential to do some damage. There’s another 10 or so earthquakes per day, and all the little quakes (a few magnitude-1.0 to 3.0) are “noise,” says Paul Earle, a seismologist at the Southern California Earthquake Center in Los Angeles. The real threats are the big ones (that are rare, and last longer than a few minutes).\n\nEarth’s surface has moved about 8,000 times in the last 300 million years, and the average frequency is about once every 20,000 years, says David Jackson, a seismologist at the Geological Society of America, who presented his findings Monday (June 29) at the group’s national convention in Boston. “That’s still a pretty noisy world,” Jackson says. (Read about how earthquakes are a danger to people and wildlife.)\n\nNow it looks like the Earth’s movement has changed. In the past 35 years, it’s switched gears to be more active than usual. It’s still not unusual for earthquakes to pop up, but historically they were about once every 80-100 years. “Over the last decade [there’s been] an acceleration of seismic activity,” says seismologist William Ellsworth, who works in the seismology division at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California.\n\nThe increase could mean the beginning of the end for the Pacific Ocean’s large underwater earthquakes (which are called tsunamis). They make up 40 percent of all earthquakes and can generate waves as high as 30 meters (100 feet). About 300 million years ago, the Cascadia subduction zone under the ocean floor made a small earthquake. “And you had this giant tsunami coming out,” says seismologist Steve Nadeau. It’s not known what the tsunami left behind, but it had a big impact on the area’s inhabitants, which include whales.\n\nCascadia subduction zone, an underwater fault which runs more than 600 kilometers (365 miles) off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The Pacific plate is moving westward underneath the North American plate, and eventually it will slip and slide north, triggering a huge undersea earthquake and resulting in a giant tsunami. (Illustration by J.F. Allen / Science Photo Library)\n\nThis year is a particularly good year for these giant quakes to happen. Researchers have a pretty good idea of where the next one will be happening and a good idea of its magnitude (from an analysis of how far the ground moved seismologists can usually predict the depth of a quake, and that gives them an idea of how big it might be). So it’s a very good plan to go outside and enjoy the beach. In the Pacific Northwest, we’ll be getting more frequent but far smaller quakes — the most dangerous part comes next, when big waves from offshore cause severe damage on the coast.\n\nIn 2010, two magnitude-9 earthquakes hit off Japan’s northern Chiba Prefecture and Hokkaid, and Japan and China. The quakes were probably caused by the same fault, says seismologist Katsuhiko Ishibashi of Kobe University in western Japan. But if we have two, how do we know which one started? It’s still not clear. “It’s going to take years for this event to unravel,” says Nadeau. Researchers in Japan have collected rocks and sediments from the site, and it will take several years for them to find out exactly what went down.\n\nAn earthquake can cause a tsunami by shaking loose a small amount of sea water. This water sloshes outward, causing a wave front that moves out into the ocean. When the wave front reaches shallow water, it creates a large surge in pressure. That’s a tsunami. These waves, although typically smaller, can be big, up to 30 meters in height.\n\nThe largest recorded tsunami was a magnitude-9.0 in Japan’s 1891 Kumagawa event. However, this event produced a tsunami in just 10-15 minutes.\n\nAn example of the damage a tsunami can cause. Here, a building at Okura Hotel in Iwamizawa, Japan, takes a hit from the tsunami that occurred at 6:38 a.m. on March 19, 1991. The tsunami smashed a car into the hotel’s side door, crushing the glass and leaving debris scattered on the lobby floor.\n\nSince the last big earthquake in Japan, scientists have become a good deal more accurate at predicting where it will occur. Japanese scientists now calculate that a big earthquake off Japan could happen anywhere along a 400 kilomet", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Robert Altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book \"\"McCabe\"\" (based on Naughton's own novel), has not much in common with his last two features \"\"Badlands''\" and \"\"Nashville\"\" -- aside from Naughton and the locale -- but even the latter showed an understanding of the West's cultural myth, which Altman doesn't have (yet). Unlike both his recent features, this one is a straightforward Western rather than a parodic one. The story concerns \"Billy\" (Woody Strode, with occasional help from Burt Reynolds and Strode's co-star, Farrah Fawcett). He sets out to recover a stolen horse, taking on assorted outlaws and vengeful ranchers along the way. The action takes place about 1868 in the town of \"McCabe\", later renamed \"Sink\" and located somewhere along the Texas-Mexico border. This area is depicted as a mixture of the Old West and of Hollywood Westerns, with cowboy hats, wigs, long flowing silky drapes on Western saloon doors, and a movie-making studio set which includes a Western \"pony express\" stagecoach. Billy is first spotted by a gang of Confederate soldiers from the \"Confederate States of Southern California\" who have no trouble stealing the horse, a fact which suggests that their purpose is more than just a straightforward robbery. (This leads to a memorable scene in which the Confederate soldiers find themselves literally caught between a \"Yankee\" soldier and the camera, being shot on cue by Strode to indicate their death.) It is not long before Billy and his new companions meet Doc Smith (Alan Rickman) and his friends: the tough but kindly \"Doc\" and the good-looking but dim-witted \"Casper\". They ride with the band to a nearby \"Mexican\" village, where Billy's friends find themselves under suspicion of being Indians (the village folks are in fact Mexicans) and are given refuge by a mysterious and ominous Mexican villager (who plays to the audience, making it difficult to tell whether he is a friendly or an enemy). The two gangs meet at a gambling match, then depart to their various destinations. On their way, the cowboys come across a wounded young \"Mexican\" man tied to railroad tracks. They stop to offer him aid, then he shoots and kills Johnny \"Wrangler\" Rook (Jason Bernard), an Indian scout for the railroad. When the boys ride to the nearest town, more Mexicans are ambushed and killed or wounded by their assailants, who then disappear into the night. Billy's horse then collapses, and he is joined by two girls on a horse, both of whom are kidnapped by an escaped convict named \"Buck\" Thornton and a gang of outlaws. The boys arrive at a \"stagecoach\" station, where they find a group of prostitutes and gunfighters -- \"Pancho\" Chavez (Tony Shalhoub), \"Pepe\" (Michael Badalucco) -- and their leader \"Sheriff Brady\" (Bill McKinney), an outlaw on the run. Sheriff Brady attempts to steal the goods on the stage to finance an assassination, but this leads to a gun battle which kills his men and Peptone's, and leaves Thornton (Peter Jurasik) with a bullet in his shoulder, leading to his arrest by the boys. The next day, Thornton and his men are taken to the town jail, where the boys free him (by shooting the jail bars) and take the sheriff and his men prisoners, planning to take them to Las Vegas to be hanged. Unfortunately, the \"Mexican\" is still alive and will be taken to Las Vegas (where he turns out to be the village chief)...\n\nThis movie has a good cast: it shows that Farrah Fawcett can play the tough girl, though not the good girl. In a film about the Old West, where the line between good, bad, and downright evil has a fuzzy character, she is only moderately sympathetic. I didn't mind her casting because I always find actors like her attractive, but she does not bring much dimension to the character. In fact, she is the one who reminds me the most of the old Mary Ann (I did not mean that in a sexual way) in that she is a bit of a harridan. Woody Strode, on the other hand, is very strong in this role: that is partly to be expected, and partly because he is a much more convincing, likable actor than is Fawcett. This comes as a surprise, not because he's a really mediocre actor, but because his acting has a quality which suggests that he is better suited to the character he plays. As I have written many times before, I love Woody Strode. I do not think he is anywhere as good as he was in earlier pictures (though he is better than a lot of other \"B\" actors --", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Americans will leave Syria only when they deem it is “time and appropriate.”\n\nA major part of US military strategy in Syria has been to prevent the country’s territory from being overrun by the Syrian Army and radical militants. After months of failed attempts, the US military has recently acknowledged its presence in Syria and plans to maintain its troops there.\n\nThe Pentagon has revealed that it has deployed 1,500 US troops to the region after a year of staying “hidden” in the US territory of northern Iraq. The troops will remain in Syria through the end of the year at the earliest, according to US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, while he told CNN that Washington is “looking to provide a continued stabilizing effect.”\n\nWhile the US officials are not ready to rule out the option for the eventual retreat from the country, the Pentagon leadership has admitted that Washington’s “stabilizing” impact on Syria is not a concrete plan, and will depend on “further decisions” made by US President Barack Obama. Nevertheless, the US is not planning to increase its military presence in Syria by deploying more troops. According to Hagel, US troops will remain on the ground for the next several months.\n\nThe US officials have repeatedly admitted that they maintain troops in Syria, but refused to give any details about the deployment or a timeline.\n\nThis week was declared as the start of the “new” US military strategy in the Middle East, when the Pentagon revealed that it does not foresee the need for further troops deployments in the region.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon has never discussed the exact number of soldiers in Syria, Pentagon officials have repeatedly warned the Russian Federation not to underestimate Washington’s military strength and said that the US troops are there “to maintain the balance.”\n\nPentagon officials have also said that Syria cannot be a part of the “reordered” Middle East without a “strong US military presence.” Last November, the Defense Secretary noted that the US troops in Syria have been deployed to prevent “mission” creep in the Middle East without directly referring to Turkey’s growing military presence in the country.\n\nThe US troops in Syria currently have very limited roles to perform, said Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, adding that Washington’s intervention in Syria serves as “an insurance policy” for the region. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs has also refused to confirm rumors about the withdrawal of US troops from Syria in the case of a new US withdrawal from Iraq, noting that they are not “on the table” in any possible solution for Iraq.\n\nThe US troops are deployed in seven US bases, and the Pentagon has deployed the first drone squadron of the US Air Force. In May of this year, a US drone deployed its first strike against armed militants in Syria, killing about a dozen of them.\n\nThe Pentagon also admitted to a high degree of uncertainty whether the deployment of US troops, which is opposed by Russia, Iran, China, Iraq, and Syria, is going to be successful, but said the US troops in Syria are ready to “perform [their] missions without delay.”\n\nAlthough the US administration has not publicly admitted that it was going to withdraw its troops from Syria, Pentagon officials have said it is going to take no action without “the direction of the president.” The US deployment of the drone squadrons also shows that Turkey is planning a possible military action against Syrian forces in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turkish military has intensified the attacks at the Syrian border, shelling an area near the Syrian town of Tell Hamees, while a Russian Su-25 aircraft, along with two Mi-17 helicopters, were scrambled over Ain Issa. Turkish forces have fired multiple artillery shells at the Syrian town, while Syrian Air Force strikes targeted Ain Issa and destroyed five rebel positions on the Turkish border, Al-Masdar News reported.\n\nThe US and the EU have criticized the Turkish bombardment at the Syrian border and said that it supports the armed terrorist groups in the country.\n\nSince mid-September, the Turkish military has intensified its shelling against Ain Issa, firing over 200 artillery shells, while Syrian Army troops killed a number of Turkish mercenaries in the region. The Turkish shelling of the Syrian territory, which was accompanied by the use of mortars and heavy machine guns, is widely perceived in the Syria as a provocation.\n\nRussia has repeatedly urged Turkey and the West not to intervene in Syria, stressing that such actions are destabilizing Middle East.\n\nOn October 17, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said that the countries that have intervened in Syria have “broken up this entire region,” and that such actions are destabilizing the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkish military forces", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "We have reported on the conflict in Syria since the beginning of 2011. Over the course of that time, the conflict has morphed from a protest movement to the world’s most deadly war. At home, the conflict has split the country. The Assad government, backed by its ally Russia, has remained strong, and has largely succeeded in pacifying most of the cities and towns that rose up against Assad in 2011.\n\nBut while the violence has ebbed outside of Damascus and Aleppo, the uprising — and its aftermath — has left many families divided and torn apart. In the past weeks, we’ve seen the beginnings of a slow return to normality in the city of Homs as the government and its backers have made some progress in pacifying the city. But the situation remains volatile, with the Syrian army still maintaining control of parts of the city, and opposition forces still maintaining control of parts of the eastern suburbs of Homs.\n\nIn the rest of the country, things are largely still as they have been for the past five years. The Assad government continues to suppress the free flow of information. It continues to use human rights groups and international organizations to frame its story about Syria as a human rights crisis, ignoring international law and international human rights law. And it continues to maintain control of large swaths of Syria, even as it is losing influence over key parts of the cities that rose up against it.\n\nTo understand what life is like inside Syria today, we are speaking with the author of a new book about the conflict between Syria’s government and its people, and the family of a Syrian-American woman whose home has been occupied by opposition fighters.\n\nWhen we’re finished speaking, we’ll take you through the basics of this week’s news. But first, this week’s Five Questions with Michael Totten:\n\nFive Questions with Michael Totten\n\nWhat was going on at the Syrian protests in late 2011?\n\nThe protest movement was born out of a deep sense of the utter rottenness of Syrian society, and the utter failure of the Syrian state to do anything about it. That sense of rottenness developed over almost the entire length of the period of Ba’ath rule. There’s no doubt about that. There have been some periods throughout the entire period of Ba’ath rule where more people have been fed. But that was followed by long periods where there were famine and epidemics and things of that sort. There were great waves of arrests and arbitrary executions, and the regime was always very good at creating those waves of fear and that sense of rottenness, that it couldn’t care less about who you are and what you do. And of course, at times, the whole society itself turned into a kind of a giant prison. It’s hard enough to stay alive in Syria without having to worry very much about being arrested, or about execution, or about being killed for no reason except that it’s very unpleasant for your relatives to have to bury you, or for them to have to mourn what may have happened to you. And that was all that really happened in the first three years.\n\nThen, everything went ballistic. At the very beginning of the revolt, the Syrian army mobilized to crush the protesters in their encampments around the country, the National Security Agency started its electronic warfare campaign, that’s when they started to cut off mobile phone service, to cut off the Internet, all that stuff. And then, you get the army’s use of snipers against protesters at first, against the Free Syrian Army who were trying to organize and protect their efforts. In effect, the regime did exactly what Saddam Hussein did to the people of Iraq, and that’s what caused the protests in the first place, in 2011. In 2011, the Syrian army and the security services, or at least parts of them, were still under the command of the officer corps that had grown up under Hafez Assad (Syria’s president from 1971 to 2000) and which was closely allied with the Ba’ath party, all of whose leading figures were still alive and very powerful. So they took to the streets with their AK-47s, and killed the protesters, many of them quite coldly. Almost 10,000 people were killed, all of them by bullets intended to kill. The rest of the time, the security forces were trying to kill protesters simply because they wanted not to have to listen to anything they said.\n\nWhat’s going on at the Syrian protests today?\n\nAt the protest camp north of Homs, over the past four or five days, the Syrian Army has surrounded the camp, and it’s been doing this in cooperation with other pro-government forces. They are apparently moving in two battalions, one from the south of Syria, and the other moving slowly eastward toward Aleppo City, from the Aleppo countryside.", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Following a referendum in 1997, in which the Scottish electorate voted to end their country's 307-year-old link to the British monarch, Scotland went from being in the hands of a conservative Tory government for over a decade of prosperity to a Labour-dominated parliament for a decade of austerity.\n\nThe Scottish economy and society has grown and prospered under successive Labour and Labour Unionist government's, with the country, now officially the 'Third Republic' of the United Kingdom, now boasting the world's fastest growing economy.\n\nThe decision to separate Scotland was made by the United Kingdom, the UK parliament, the Scottish parliament and the United Nations. The issue is complex, and as such will be covered in full in our Guide to Constitutional Politics and the Independence Referendum. However, for the sake of those who will read the guide later, but also those who are interested enough to want to read it, this will cover the most topical aspects of independence.\n\nThe British Economy\n\nThe economic miracle that is Britain is not the creation of either of the main political parties, it is merely the result of Labour's and Labour Unionist's successful management of the nation's economic policies.\n\nAs of June 2000, the UK had a Gross Domestic Product of £2.7 trillion. A few months earlier it had been £1 trillion. The result of that growth has been Britain's growing economic power abroad as opposed to the nation's declining financial power domestically. The government of that time, Conservative, led by Margaret Thatcher, managed to reduce debt, inflation and unemployment, while increasing wealth in such measures as investment.\n\nThroughout the 1980's and 1990's, the conservative party, led by Margaret Thatcher in the UK, and presidents Ronald Reagan in the US and Helmut Kohl in Germany, began the trend of making economic growth and prosperity the core issue of democratic government. The conservative movement was initially the result of anger towards big spending, high taxation policies of the Labour party, of whom Margaret Thatcher, Thatcherism and Conservatism have become synonymous. The subsequent result of the policies of the conservative party, and the success they achieved, has been a surge in the wealth and power of the UK economy, while simultaneously reducing the power of the government in terms of spending and taxation, as they have become the party of the rich.\n\nThis has lead to several consequences regarding the economic policies of the Conservative and Conservative Unionist government's. Firstly, the Conservative government began reducing employment, unemployment has since fallen to 3.5%, the UK's lowest level since 1975. This means the government should have less incentive to fund the services previously paid for by unemployment, yet the result has been a continuation of the 'northern powerhouse' industrial policies that made Thatcher's Tory's popular, such as the 'Big Bang' programme which reduced the number of local councillors from 80,000 to 20,000. More recently, the government has been looking to increase funding for health and social services. A move which is unpopular among the electorate, as it is the only party that voted against the reduction in local council funding, but also the only party who doesn't believe in raising the taxes to pay for it.\n\nIn turn, as the government has increasingly tried to shift money from the working class, the electorate has increasingly responded by demanding the reduction of spending on social services.\n\nIn addition to this, as a result of the increased power of the private sector in the economy, the government was able to shift all of the power to raise revenue and spend it on public services from the government to private companies. A shift which has been successful in most cases, as tax evasion through the use of companies and offshore tax havens has been reduced significantly through the efforts of both the Labour and Conservative government's. The most recent example of this in action is the introduction of the 'Google tax' (an effective income tax based on the number of searches that take place in the nation) and the introduction of the 'Google tax' (an effective income tax based on the number of searches that take place in the nation), which was introduced alongside the 'internet revolution' that is the internet.\n\nScotland's Economy\n\nAs of 2003, the economic situation in Scotland was largely similar to the rest of the United Kingdom. Though there has been an increase of unemployment, the highest in twenty years, as of 2001, the growth of the Scotland's Gross Domestic Product was the world's fastest, rising at a rate of 7% over the course of that year.\n\nAfter the devolution of control over policy towards Scotland's economic future, its economy began to slow. In 1990, Scottish GDP was £21 billion, by 2000 it was £30 billion.\n\nScotland's population, which also grew during the 90's, also contributed to this slowdown, when in 1995, Scotland had a population of 5.7 million people. In 2006, Scotland was the fifth most populous country in Europe, with 6.29 million residents, a figure which continued to grow", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "regardless of what anyone says, its a b-movie, and the fact that the director took the job is proof of his low self esteem, and the way the movie was made is proof of that.\n\nSpencer Pratt and Heidi Montag will NOT get married, I love that it has been widely reported that they are back to being together.\n\nWhen is Heidi going public again with her drug problems, and will Spencer admit the truth about her that he was the one who kicked her out of the house and told her to start meth to feel like a man again?\n\nWhat Heidi should do is start a business, maybe one like she was advertising on the website, and get the help she really needs!\n\nOh and to Heidi’s new boyfriend…he can keep his nose out of Heidi’s past, unless Spencer and Heidi reconcile\n\nTo the person who said Spencer didn’t do anything in order to make money. I believe that if Spencer Pratt didn’t do anything in order to make money, then he didn’t make half the money he does now. As of late, you have been seeing it on blogs, blogs (mainly Perez Hilton), and even other websites that Spencer Pratt has a net worth of around half a billion dollars. Why do you think that is? Because Spencer is making money through his clothing company, that is why. I don’t believe that Spencer Pratt would go through all of this trouble if it wasn’t for money, Spencer is way too stupid to think that way.\n\nAs for the question: When do you think that Heidi will go public about her drug abuse? I don’t think that she is doing it anymore, and she was pretty bad when she did it, but if something happens to her it will come out. Heidi and Spencer always did a lot of drugs in their relationship. I would never believe that Heidi went to any rehab place that is private, because they want her to keep rehabbing until she has her next tattoo, or whatever reason they tell her is the reason she needs rehab.\n\nI don’t believe in getting back together, but I still like the idea of Heidi trying to get another boyfriend who is more down to earth. There are a lot of people out there who have no knowledge of what went on in Heidi’s former relationship, and she needs friends.\n\nLily Allen will get back with her husband, I know because I’ve watched the show “The Cut” and know alot of people who work for “The Cut”.\n\nIf you watch the show “The Cut”, you can see Lily Allen’s husband is actually really into her. If she’s going to lose her husband, I honestly hope that it’s because of divorce rather than something terrible like an accident.\n\nThe rumors are that he was driving over the speed limit and that didn’t feel like it was safe after he was speeding, so he slowed down and he hit a pedestrian, killing him. He got into a coma and eventually died. There were some witnesses who saw him hit a car and then pull over, but didn’t see them come out of the car and walk over the pedestrian.\n\nI think in America, if people are guilty of something, they are punished. She’s not going to jail though, obviously, and maybe they’ll let her go because she was driving, not a pedestrian. I don’t think she will be going to jail though. I don’t think she’s going to want to go to jail.\n\nWho were these guys? They obviously worked very hard for the most part to make sure that one of them would have the most famous story. The reason why I think that the second guy is the winner though, is because he’s the only one who’s been doing interviews saying that he will not attend the award ceremony, which the others had to. I also believe that a big part of it was because of the other guy because I think that he made a deal with the producers to go, but then changed his mind.\n\nI think the producers will get back with their boyfriends, but then I think it will be one of them having an affair. There will be no more cheating when they’re in their 30s. It’s too sad to see. I’m sorry to say that I hope this is for the best, but I still hope for the worst. Oh and I just want to say this: I hope she never gets married again.\n\nYou can’t imagine how happy I was when I found this website. I was wondering where all of my people were. I thought you people were all dead. You people are still very much alive in my heart. I hope for all of", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "This is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. All the actors are in love with themselves, and the movie is even worse than most of the things the stars themselves produce. I'm quite happy to say that this is one of the worst movies of all time.\n\nIf I was honest, this would be the best of a very low group that includes this, the terrible \"It's a Wonderful Life\", and \"Star Trek IV\". But at the same time, it's not one of the worst movies ever made -- though you can have some fun thinking about why.\n\nA film is called \"The Best of All Worlds\", but it's really a great example of being \"None of the above\". It's a film about a man who's a robot with human-alien/machine/superheated fusion DNA. He develops a conscience, becomes a good man and decides to end his life.\n\nIf you have the heart to watch two minutes of this movie, I'll make a deal with you that after I finish my review you will buy me a drink.\n\nThe film is very pretentious, and is very poorly made. The actors are in love with themselves, and it's the most awful, pretentious film ever made -- as it just seems to be a film made for people like the crew of the Starship It's A Wonderful Life, and other people who have the same attitude of being in love with themselves.\n\nAll the actors were actually good in this, but they all felt the way they felt to give the film its pretentious tone.\n\nThis is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. However, it does contain that one scene where that guy, who has the most lines of dialogue in the most movies ever, gets out a gun. And as soon as you see him take the gun out, you realise how badly the director of this movie has made the entire film.\n\nThis is a bad movie, that will be remembered more by those people who think movies about aliens are terrible.\n\nThere's no point telling you more about this film, as it makes no sense at all.\n\nThis film is so bad it's actually good, and is actually so good it's bad.\n\nIf I was honest, it probably isn't too bad. It has some good scenes, as well as some awful one. It's the kind of film that no other film, or movie franchise, wants to be. If you like this film, there's nothing that you are going to be able to do better, as this will be the film of your dreams.\n\nThe reason you can give this a good review is because you really like to be challenged on how you actually feel about any subject. And \"The Phantom Menace\" and \"Godzilla\" do challenge anything you consider to be true.\n\nIf people were able to sit down and watch this film and actually say \"This is just rubbish\", then there could be some good out of it, but it doesn't.\n\nIf you want to know my review of this movie, you'll find it on the second page of this article, where you can learn how it's a film about alien-human fusion people who turn into lizards because I don't want to write a three-page review on this film.\n\nThe plot involves the invasion of Earth by alien lizard men, and the only way to stop them is for the lizards to get into people's heads. That's a great idea for a film, but it doesn't hold up. There are a lot of other good ideas for a film in this movie, but there are too many bad ones, as well. The aliens with human-lizard fusion DNA could have been some of the best aliens ever in a film, but they're just horrible. They look like human beings with lizards' heads, and they act like them, too.\n\nSome of the acting was good, but there's no telling what kind of acting was in this movie, as there are so many different types.\n\nIf you're interested, I have a review of this bad film here. It's a review of one of the worst films ever made, and tells how it's a terrible film that should have been completely forgotten.\n\nIf you're going to watch this film, make sure you watch it with headphones. That way, you can enjoy the entire film with no sound at all -- since this is a silent movie. It's actually a film made for a silent film.\n\nThe only reason I watched this film was for the scene in it where a character makes a gun. And that's exactly the worst part of this terrible film.\n\nThis movie tells the story of a man, who has an alien who's also a robot in his head. He becomes a good person and decides to escape from where he's being held. There are other good parts to this movie, but they're too", "label": "gptj"}

So it would be very difficult for Scotland to go outside that convention and take part in that activity.” She said “I am looking forward to speaking to my colleagues at Westminster on this matter.”\n\nIn January Human Rights Watch Scotland claimed the UK government had failed to take “steps to prevent complicity in torture by UK residents and UK nationals suspected of involvement with the UK’s clandestine secret interrogation and detention programme to which at least two Scottish citizens have allegedly been subjected”.\n\nIt said it had uncovered “clear evidence that suspects are being unlawfully subject to incommunicado detention in Scotland as well as in the south of England” in part because “the UK government has not moved to prohibit the UK-wide use of secret detention without charge”.\n\nThe charity said UK nationals including an alleged high-ranking former MI6 officer were continuing to face prosecution and imprisonment in Scotland even after they left the UK and had fled the justice system in other jurisdictions.\n\nAt a news conference in February, the Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said the UK government had assured the Scottish justice system that “the situation in respect of the UK’s secret detention policy in Scotland is as it is in England, Scotland and Wales”.\n\nBut he added: “Scotland remains a jurisdiction where people can be detained and put in secret locations without being charged or appearing before a court. It is not a matter for speculation. We have been assured by Scotland Office officials that this is no longer the case.”\n\nIn his statement in the Scottish parliament on Thursday, the Labour MSP added: “The Scottish government must take steps immediately to prevent complicity in torture.\n\n“One of the most appalling human rights abuses since the Second World War has been the CIA’s notorious interrogation and detention programme in Europe, which has included the UK.\n\n“I am alarmed by the continuing abuse of the United States’ own legal obligations on torture. It is only right that Scotland looks to see how its laws measure up to international standards.\n\n“Scotland will do all it can, working with the United Nations and other allies, to end any practice or policy which contravenes the UN Convention Against Torture.”\n\nHe said Scotland was “well aware of the Scottish people’s clear commitment to the rule of law and to international treaties. We must make Scotland’s laws conform to international standards.”\n\nHis colleague, the SNP MSP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, Eilidh MacLeod, said: “It is important that we act to ensure that the UK government respects Scotland’s position as a signatory to the UK-wide prohibition of torture.\n\n“We are proud to have been a country which helped to make torture unthinkable – and which is determined to make sure that other countries do the same.”\n\nThe Scottish Government said it understood that “under article 7 of the UN Convention against Torture, there is no provision for the UK to prevent Scots from being tortured”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Scottish government said: “The Scottish government will be taking a close interest in the case against Mhamed Kaddour, and will take full account of our obligations under international human rights law, including the provisions of the UN Convention against Torture.”\n\nOn Saturday, after the UK cabinet meeting, Mr Matheson said: “In light of the fact and at the request of the Scottish Government, the Scottish Secretary asked the UK home secretary to invite the chief commissioner of the Scottish police to accompany him to his ministerial meeting with the UK home secretary on 6 April.\n\n“The chief commissioner will offer an update on the Scottish Government’s review of the investigation around the disappearance of Madeleine McCann’s parents.”", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "[ purpose ] the purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence\na professional nurse with her decision to leave her current place of work,\nwhere she has been trained in both nursing and hospital administration.\n\n[ design ] the authors' thesis study uses a combination of grounded theory and\nquantitative techniques.\n\n[ background ] in order to have a working relationship with the nurses and\nadministrators of a regional hospital, the researcher had to first work as a nurse,\na clinical area manager, and an administrator prior to beginning data\ncollection.\n\n[ methods ] the authors' methodological procedure included the following: the\nauthors used grounded theory methods to identify the factors that influence\nthe decision of a professional nurse to leave her current place of work in a\nregional hospital, where she has been trained in both nursing and hospital\nadministration. Quantitative methods were used to compare the career\ncommitment of those nurses that have chosen to leave with those who chose not\nto.\n\n[ results ] the decision to leave the profession was a result of either poor\nwork environment, staff shortages, or both. The poor work environment was due\nto work stress, staff shortages, and a high work load.\n\n[ discussion ] the high work load and staff shortage are consistent with\nanother study of nurses in New York City, and the finding that the work\nenvironment played a larger role in the decision of the experienced nurses to\nleave their professional career than the staff shortage factor. This suggests\nthat the nurses who stay stay because they have a sense of loyalty to the job\nor are influenced to stay by the rewards, advancement opportunities, or even\nfamily or personal obligations in their job.\n\n[ conclusion ] the authors would recommend that hospital administrators address\nthis issue before it becomes too late because nursing shortages have reached the\npoint that hospitals are becoming incapable of meeting patient care needs.\n\nIn the context of\n\n[ purpose ] the question that this study has posed to the professional nurse is\nwhat\n\n[ background ] the author's thesis study combines the use of grounded theory and\nquantitative research methods.\n\n[ design ] the study is based on the qualitative research design which utilizes\nin depth interviews with both the sample as well as focus group\nsessions.\n\n[ methods ] in order to be able to collect data as they occur, the authors used\ncategorical or non-numeric codes. These codes include: the purpose, the\nmethods and the results.\n\n[ results ] the results were collected using the grounded theory approach. A\ncoding tree was produced which was sorted into the various categories. These\ncoding categories were used to answer the research question of what influenced\nnursing professionals to leave their jobs.\n\n[ discussion ] there were four themes found: the staff shortage was the primary\ninfluence on the decisions to be made either to leave the job or stay; the\nwork environment was the second factor influencing the decision; family\nconcerns and/ or marriage were the third factor; and the rewards such as\nenjoyment and financial issues were the fourth factor.\n\n[ conclusion ] in order to promote the quality of health care to a larger\nnumber of patients, the author is of the opinion that every nurse working in\nthis profession should be provided with a better work place and more\nopportunities for advancement.\n\n[ purpose ] the aim of this thesis is to show that there is no single solution\nto the nursing shortage in the state of Delaware. Since the nurse is an integral\nmember of the health care team, it is essential to the quality of patient care\nthat adequate numbers be available.\n\n[ background ] the author began with several questions which she addressed through\na series of interviews with individuals at all levels ranging from administrators,\nmanagers and nurses to the practicing nurses directly involved with patient care.\n\n[ design ] the study was performed by reviewing documents, conducting interviews,\nobtaining data from the health care data base and analyzing the data. With the\nuse of qualitative techniques, the data were grouped and analyzed to draw\nconclusions. One of the first steps the researcher took was to determine the\npurpose of the study.\n\n[ methods ] the author determined that qualitative analysis of the data would be\nimportant since she was a new researcher at the research institution.\n\n[ results ] the major theme found was that, although every facility does have\npatients that have a problem, such problems only seem to occur on a small scale.\n\n[ results ] the second theme found was that of financial problems.

{"text": "did it), an enigmatic occultist finds and trains her to be a master of the arts to fight on the front lines of the War against the Shadow, a group of rebels led by General Gaius Julius Caesar.\n\nIt's probably safe to say that no one has ever seen a girl go from strength to strength like this before: She is a powerhouse who, at first glance, makes every other character feel like a pathetic weakling, and yet she is still somehow capable of doing extraordinary and impossible feats. It'll be challenging and fun to see her continue to develop as the game progresses.\n\nYou, on the other hand, as the player, feel like a nobody who's in a war you had no idea you were ever even in. No one was ever going to recognize you for helping one of the few superheroes in the entire world, and yet, as soon as all of the pieces start to fall into place, you realize that your name is on the list of things that the government is paying attention to. Who are you?!\n\nThe story is not written well. The dialogue is awkward, and the exposition is just about as clunky as it gets, but, once the story gets rolling, you really can't help but like the characters and feel invested in them and their goals.\n\nIt's really refreshing to have a superhero series that's not just centered on some kind of ubermensch like Aquaman or Wolverine. It was refreshing to not feel like I'm playing someone who spends the game constantly fighting to survive another encounter with the bad guys, or trying to find out what the plot of the story is so I can get back to the part of my life I should be worrying about; a series that puts me into the shoes of the villains. There is not a weak link in the entire series, which keeps the pace of the gameplay up, and as each part of the story unfolds, I felt like I really had a sense of where each part was leading me and what I was trying to do. There were times when I found myself frustrated because I wished I could just skip forward in time and skip through all of the exposition, but a scene I had to go to was well-written enough to make you feel like you actually needed to be there, and it was a good lesson: sometimes, the story just isn't about you.\n\nAt the same time, the characters don't just sit there and spout exposition all the time. They'll make you feel like you're having a conversation with someone you know, or a debate, or a war council. Even though this series has no dialogue or character customization, it made me feel like it absolutely should have both of those things considering that the entire premise is centered around the conversation between characters.\n\nAnd, of course, the gameplay takes advantage of it. There are loads of options and variations that let you use your own style of play: you can fight hand to hand, jump into the air, use a gun or a blade or your magical abilities, make other characters use their powers, turn them into your allies, manipulate their powers and so on. It's up to you how you'd like to play, but it's hard not to come away from the game thinking that the developers really thought through every aspect of what they were making and wanted to be able to make it play as many different ways as they could. The controls were always intuitive and responsive as long as you had the right setup.\n\nIn summary: despite the clunky dialogue and awkward exposition, this is easily the best video game ever released for the Playstation 4 and it may be the best in the entire series. It's fast-paced, engaging, and a real blast to play.", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Is it a perfect movie? No. It is a weird movie with no plot and a lot of mistakes. When a film doesn’t have a plot most people say it is a perfect film, but it is not. Film is made in such a creative way that almost none of the films ever finish, and the first movie made by a director always end up in the wrong place. I am telling you that only the very first movie made by a director ever ends in the right place. Some directors don’t even make a film. They say they want to, but they never do.\n\nI believe I should know a thing or two about film. I’ve watched a lot of films and I’ve thought a lot about film and I’d like to say that I’m really an expert. The problem is that, because I’ve watched so many films, I can’t say for certain whether my analysis is true. This is just a bit of fun, to see how well an amateur can do, so go and watch the film and answer me a few questions.\n\n1. What was your first thought, right after you watched the film?\n\nI enjoyed the style of the film, the way the director told me to look at the film. It was the first time I felt so relaxed looking at a film.\n\n2. How was the film made? Who was the scriptwriter? The director?\n\nI was the scriptwriter and the director.\n\n3. Who is the film based from?\n\nThe film was inspired from the short story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\n4. What is your favorite scene in the movie? What scene was the most hard to shoot (no matter how good it is)?\n\nThe last shot was my favorite. It was the hardest shot to do, because I shot it at night and the lighting wasn’t enough to make an amazing reflection on the water.\n\n5. Who is your favorite actor? Why?\n\nI loved all of the actors in the movie except for my wife.\n\n6. How many more times do you wish that the same director made the film?\n\nI’d like to see the film again. It is too long and I wouldn’t want to see it once more, because it is over.\n\n7. How would you rate the acting in the film?\n\nPerfect acting. Every actor made it perfectly.\n\n8. Which director would you like to compare to?\n\nI’d like to compare it to my own film.\n\n9. How did you like the setting of the film?\n\nI was happy that the film was set in New York.\n\n10. Were you able to identify all shots in it?\n\nYes, everything in the film was easy to identify and understand.\n\n10 minutes of talking and reading all the answers. So simple I can do it.\n\n1. What was your first thought, right after you watched the film?\n\nIt was a good movie.\n\n2. How was the film made? Who was the scriptwriter? The director?\n\nBoth. I wrote the original script and I directed it.\n\n3. What is your favorite scene in the movie? What scene was the most hard to shoot (no matter how good it is)?\n\nI liked the last shot.\n\n4. Who is your favorite actor? Why?\n\nI liked all of them. The girl played a great role in the film.\n\n5. How would you rate the acting in the film?\n\nExcellent acting in a good movie.\n\n6. Which director would you like to compare to?\n\nI liked all the directors I have seen making movies.\n\n7. How did you like the setting of the film?\n\nI liked the setting because of the cinematography.\n\n8. Were you able to identify all shots in it?\n\nYes. I did it to see if someone was trying to manipulate me.\n\n9. Which actress is most similar to the lead of the film? Why?\n\nIt was a girl with purple hair. She was similar looking.\n\n10. Are you a student or not?\n\nNot really. I am just a fan of film and some people can recognize me in public because of that.\n\n10 minutes of talking and reading the answers. Can you do it?\n\nIt’s a short film. I can do it in 10 minutes.\n\nThe first movie ever made by a director\n\nSo you made your first movie?\n\nYes and it’s called “The Murder of Helen Keller”.\n\n1.

{"text": "\"The conversation around equality and representation has never been stronger,\" said Rep. Gia Resnick (D-Santa Monica), a supporter of the bill.\n\n\"In every region, communities are coming together.\"\n\nBut the bill is expected to face its share of opposition. Several groups — including the California Restaurant Assn. and the California Medical Assn. — have already come out against a similar bill last year that never made it out of committee.\n\n\"We are concerned that this bill ignores the reality of how women actually experience sexual harassment in the workplace,\" the restaurant group said in its statement.\n\n\"It is time to put an end to this discrimination.\"\n\nAnd for every group that supports this bill, there will be at least one group that opposes it — especially for the Hollywood community, which is currently reeling from a sexual harassment and misconduct scandal.\n\n\"When a man has power over you, it's a violation of the social contract and this bill would codify that,\" said Laura Bela-Hernandez, a producer and writer. \"It's important, right now, to get ahead of this problem instead of waiting for someone else to do it.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Capitol Resource Institute, a public policy advocacy group based in Sacramento, had no immediate comment on the proposal Saturday.\n\nMore than a dozen women have accused top producers, including Harvey Weinstein, on his Miramax, The Weinstein Co. and The Weinstein Co. slate of sexual harassment and misconduct. The scandal has also included accusations of sexual impropriety against other prominent figures, including producer-director James Toback, director Brett Ratner and director Ryan Murphy.\n\nIn the past few months, the hashtag #metoo has been used more than a half billion times to describe people sharing stories of abuse.\n\nIn California, there have been many proposed bills over the past few months to address sexual violence and harassment in the workplace. Among them:\n\nIn October, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law a slate of bills that included one dealing with sexual harassment and misconduct.\n\nThe law expanded the definition of harassment, and added a provision to the California Fair Employment and Housing Act that bars retaliation against employees who refuse to engage in unwanted sexual conduct.\n\nFor the first time, sexual harassment in the workplace can include \"hostile work environment\" claims.\n\nSome of those laws passed in 2016 and are now in place. The law also requires more sexual harassment training for employees and employers.\n\n\"The passage of this law is going to make a huge impact,\" said Barbara Rooks, legislative advocate for the National Organization for Women.\n\nThe new law also included a provision that required some schools to provide \"affirmative consent\" by students before they can be sexual partners with each other — which was the topic of a heated floor debate in April.\n\nThat law was ultimately signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in May. Brown said students who want to engage in sexual relationships have to be clear about what they want and give their full consent and that they are \"unambiguously\" aware of the situation.\n\n\"Affirmative consent should replace ignorance of what consent looks like and is communicated as, as the standard of conduct for the people in a relationship,\" Brown said back in May at the capitol. \"We expect that people that are in a relationship know that behavior and are able to communicate 'Yes.' They know what consent looks like. That is the baseline.\"\n\nThe bill for the new legislation, however, had been introduced several times in 2016 and 2017 without going to the floor. And in April 2018, a Democrat from Santa Clara, Sen. Jeff Stone, called for it to be shelved.\n\n\"I am not in favor of this bill,\" Stone told the Washington Post. \"People should have their own free will to say 'Yes.' To have that forced just adds another element of stress to a student.\"\n\nThere are two other bills on their way to the state Capitol this year in an effort to deal with sexual assault and other sexual misconduct allegations at the college level.\n\nIn September, a bill was introduced to make those campuses safer. It would set higher reporting time frames and provide student support for \"sexual misconduct\" complaints.\n\nIn a recent Associated Press report, college administrators said that many schools already had procedures in place to handle sexual misconduct. They also said they did not have a way to collect data on sexual misconduct in the schools that don't already have tracking programs.\n\n\"I'm not saying that the colleges are doing a bad job, but I think their existing data collection is not robust enough,\" California Secretary of Education Tom Torlakson told Associated Press.\n\nThe bill is being spearheaded by four state senators: Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens; Connie Leyva, D-Chino; Bill Monning, D-Carmel; and Mike McGuire, D-Healdsburg.", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "It is hardly a place you would associate with acid attacks. But the number of such attacks in the town of New Delhi rose from just three in 2008 to more than 3,400 cases last year. The reason, according to some Delhi politicians: a recent government education campaign about the dangers of oral sex has failed to make headway with the country’s youth, which is dominated by a group that, for centuries, has been loath to talk about oral sex.\n\n“We have our own culture,” said Jai Prakash Agarwal, who with his wife, Asha Sharma, is at the centre of the anti-acid-attack movement. “We don’t think people should have sex before marriage.”\n\nIndia’s marriage customs have been criticised throughout the 20th century. In the 1940s, the anthropologist V.S.Naipaul wrote: “Marriage is the only truly monogamous institution. All the others, from the polygamous family to the ‘sacred prostitution’ of the bhangra dancers, are adulteries of one sort or another”. In more modern times, activists have blamed dowry demands for much of the country’s high rate of infant mortality. “India has one of the highest fertility rate in the world,” says Dr Ramachandra Guha, a historian and the author of “Tata: The Marrying Kind“. “But if the marriage rate could go up — then it is clear there is a huge amount of potential fertility, and we simply haven’t tapped this. In these villages, nobody ever talks about family planning.”\n\nMr Agarwal would not tell me how many acid attacks he suffered, but the number is alarming. “It went through the roof when it was on the front page,” he said.\n\nIn 2012, the Delhi High Court asked him to become a member of the All India Public Gathas (Aipg), a voluntary organisation created in 2001 “with the sole purpose of safeguarding the moral and social values of our society”. It began with a few hundred people. As the organisation grew, it organised awareness sessions; and, in November 2012, it produced a “Poster Campaign on the Dangers of Acid Attacks“. (The next year, the High Court was again critical of the Aipg’s work, after the Aipg refused to include an anti-rape message, from the government of Uttar Pradesh, as part its poster campaign; a poster that the High Court ruled “may act as a powerful antidote to the culture of sexual assault“.)\n\nOn October 12th, Ms Sharma and 11 other members of the Aipg went to the Delhi University to speak. “These boys think our culture is archaic,” says a man who answered the door at Sharma’s flat (a young woman and a young child were inside). “It is not. The culture has been violated. The girl must be brought back.”\n\nAccording to the National Crime Records Bureau, the number of acid attacks has increased nearly seven-fold from 2009 to 2012. Figures for 2013 are just being calculated, but they expect to approach 3,700 cases. In New Delhi, the incidence of attack rose from eight in 2009 to more than 3,400 in 2012.\n\nThe Aipg’s poster campaign had two main points: warning against unprotected sex and the danger, in the city, of acid attacks. The campaigns took place in at least 16 cities, including the state of Uttarakhand, the state of Mizoram, the city of Meerut and the town of Ludhiana. It was most successful in the north-western state of Punjab and the northern city of Guwahati. But according to some academics in India and abroad, it seems to have had little success.\n\nThere is, they say, a lot of ignorance about oral sex. And when there is ignorance, women suffer.\n\nAccording to Dr Dhananjay Mahapatra, an anthropologist who founded the Women and Child Development Unit at Ranchi University, when it comes to attitudes towards sex and sex education in India, “sex is very much tied with marriage. In the west, we are more open about sex, and more open about sexuality.” Women might be more used to talking about sex education and the subject of oral-genital contact than Indian women, he said, in part due to the prevalence of dowry demands among India’s poor. Many women must pay their fiancé’s parents for a house and, with the hope that this will help them marry off their daughter, do not dare to think about oral sex. “If they raise that concern, they are told: ‘Get her raped.’", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Craig Steven Wright is one of the most peculiar characters in the history of crypto.\n\nA man with a curious history, he has had several names in his life, including Kimoto Craig, Wright Craig and Criag Wright and is even believed by some to be an impostor with false memories and no legitimate claim to a name.\n\nYet on the crypto subreddit r/Ethtrader he was once one of the most well known traders in the bitcoin universe, with at one time boasting 1.5M followers on Twitter. Wright has a Twitter account, with thousands of followers and his posts get thousands of likes and retweets. That’s largely thanks to his unique trading style.\n\nWright’s trading style is best compared to a kind of hybrid between a traditional futures trader, and a market maker using algorithms. He uses a few proprietary algorithms that help him spot when to buy and when to sell, and he trades across multiple markets and exchanges.\n\nBut how did a professional trader such as Wright end up starting so many bitcoin podcasts and being the CEO of bitcoin trading firm Bitcoin Education Services? The answer to this question is surprisingly simple. After being laid off from his job and not having any savings he decided to learn how to become a more successful trader.\n\nWright’s history in the tech world started at the age of 12, when he was introduced to trading on the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Cex.io, which was founded by the Winklevoss twins, who went on to create one of the early bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWright, who was then 13 at the time, had little luck with Cex.io and was largely just a lurker in the community. However, Wright became more interested in the space in after watching a COO get arrested for fraud and later being hired by Blockbuster as an intern at the age of 16. Wright also helped develop a crypto game and blockchain project at the age of 18 with fellow MIT students.\n\nHe took jobs at startups and worked on a bitcoin-focused start-up at the age of 18, but after finding the start-up’s product was never going to be released he decided to focus entirely on trading. At the age of 21, Wright was one of the most successful traders at his school and also won trading competitions around the world.\n\nBy the age of 22, he was already teaching at a trading school, the College of Trading, and in 2013 Wright left the U.S. to move to Tokyo where he enrolled at the prestigious Hitotsubashi University, earning a degree in business and commerce.\n\nBut by this stage Wright had already left the University to begin trading full-time at 23 after his uncle, who had become a trader himself, suggested it to him as he did not yet have the licenses to operate a fully regulated brokerage house in Japan. In 2014, Wright and another uncle started Wright Brothers, an international bitcoin brokerage that helped clients trade on multiple exchanges. While Wright Brothers is now defunct, it was one of the earliest and largest international brokering houses on the market.\n\nHowever, Wright Brothers started to go under when it was revealed that Wright had been a fraudulent operator, with a number of users coming forward to state that their accounts had been used to pay for Wright’s own personal spending.\n\nIn an interview with the Bitcoinist in 2014, Wright admitted that Wright Brothers ran up bills for thousands of dollars in a single day.\n\nWright Brothers was eventually shut down by the Japanese government and Wright was ordered to pay $6,000,000.\n\nWright was eventually found by a federal investigator, who asked him to prove that he owned all of the stolen funds, which is when he contacted CoinIdol, a sister site of the CoinDesk, to tell us his fascinating story. During the interview, Wright provided a number of additional details that have never been revealed before.\n\n“This whole thing has been going on for a long time,” Wright told Coinidol. “I’m basically a fraudster, but a bit of a good one.” Wright said. “The $6 million in my bank account, the money that the FBI wanted was my money, but I didn’t actually make it. I’ve had all that time to spend, to think about it, to write books, to write articles, and it’s not really that much.”\n\nWright has published many books and online projects, many of them on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but what do you really need to understand the story of Wright? Well, I think this should be enough to start you off.\n\nA tale of two coins\n\nWhen Satoshi Nakamoto created the first ever, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency in 2008, what was he actually setting in motion?

{"text": "background and objectives : the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of low-grade salivary gland neoplasms (LGNs) in a population-based setting and to determine the clinical significance of LGNs and the optimal method of clinical detection.\n\ndesign: retrospective cohort study.\n\nsubjects: the files of 1,062 non-AIDS patients (821 men, 241 women), aged 20–89 years, hospitalized at a single medical center from January 2005 to October 2007 were reviewed. Sex and age distribution, tumor site and histologic subtype, stage and survival rate were registered.\n\nresults: among 1,062 patients, there were 534 HIV-positive (M:F, 37:1), including four patients with LGNs (0.4%), who did not differ in terms of sex or age from those without LGNs (M:F, 0.7%: p = 0.3, aged 55.7 ± 15.0 vs 55.4 ± 13.1 years respectively; p = 0.8), but they had a lower rate of alcohol addiction (10% vs 33.7%; P = 0.002). LGNs were identified at a higher rate in the HIV-infected group than in the group without HIV (0.3% vs 0%, p = 0.009), in those taking antiretroviral drugs (0.3% vs 0%, p = 0.009), and in those who had detectable plasma HIV RNA levels of above 1000 copies/ml (0.3% vs 0.2%, p = 0.04). None of the patients with LGNs was human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I-positive. A subset of patients had no other relevant disease (M:F, 1:1), which was more commonly identified in the HIV-positive group than in the group without HIV (33.3% vs 10.5%; p<0.001). After controlling for other co-variables, HIV infection remained significantly associated with the occurrence of LGNs. The overall 5-year survival rate was significantly lower in patients with LGNs than in those without them (p<0.005). LGNs occurred in about 10 times more often in HIV-infected than uninfected individuals aged 40 and over.\n\nconclusion: a relatively high but acceptable prevalence of LGNs, which occurs in a subset of patients without other associated illness, was found in this population-based setting. These tumors show an unexpected association with HIV infection and a worse survival outcome.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLow-grade salivary gland neoplasms (LGNs)\nare rare, benign mesenchymal tumor that can occur as solitary or multiple salivary gland masses.1–7 Although a majority of LGNs is associated with autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disorders, the rest lack any apparent etiology.7,8 LGNs are well known to be premalignant or precancerous entities and have been frequently associated with development of multiple myeloma, as noted in a case published in 19878 (see Table 6).8 However, because the majority of cases are detected incidentally and without associated systemic manifestations, the clinical significance of solitary LGNs remains controversial. Only 14 published cases of HIV-related LGNs have been reported thus far.\n\nThe prevalence of salivary glands tumors in general populations is unknown, although several retrospective studies have assessed frequency of salivary gland neoplasms, mostly parotid gland tumors, in patients with established HIV infection.9–12 To our knowledge, only three other reports on LGNs in patients with established HIV infection were published.13–15 According to data from SEER (SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1973–1998), in the United States a relatively low prevalence of this tumor (0.3%) was found by using cancer-specific SEER data. To date, there is a paucity of data on LGNs in a population-based setting.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of LGNs and the relationship with HIV infection and other non-HIV-associated illnesses in a community-based setting.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThe Files of 1,062 Non-AIDS Patients hospitalized at the D’Amicis Hospital, Palermo, Italy, and at the San Martino Hospital, Novara, Italy, from January 2005 to October 2007 were reviewed retrospectively (see Table 1). The study was approved by the local institutional review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The patients’ sex and age as well as tumor site and histological subtype, stage and survival rate were registered. According to the TNM classification, LGNs, non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, and plasma cell dyscrasias were considered at", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a local level. How much progress have women made?\n\nAhead of International Women’s Day (IWD), here are some facts about global gender inequality from the World Bank Institute that may surprise you.\n\n1. Global inequality is more unequally shared between women and men than between countries, for instance, in terms of women/men life expectancy ratios.\n\n2. Of the nearly 20 million girls (aged 10-19) out of school globally, one third live in sub-Saharan Africa and around 10% in western Europe and North America.\n\n3. The total number of women participating in formal labour markets has been increasing but the ‘global gender gap’ remains in the range 3:1 or 4:1, i.e. a higher number of women in low-skilled jobs.\n\n4. In 2017, the estimated gap between male and female earnings in the workforce was around USD 1,300 on average.\n\n5. In the last 20 years, women in the least industrialised countries now earn an average of USD 7.3% less than male workers, the latest available figures suggest.\n\nBut as the picture is more localised, in any specific country, income inequality is greater between gender or caste than within gender or caste, for instance, an estimated 10 to 20 percentage points for rural vs. urban and around 30 to 50 percentages points for tribal versus other ethnic groups.\n\n6. In developed countries like the US, inequality is most pronounced for non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics.\n\nFor instance, for Black and Hispanic men, the ratio of median income of men to the average income of women is 14:1 compared to a ratio of 9 and 3:1 respectively for White and Asian men and women. Similarly, the White/non-Hispanic gap in median male/female income is 23 to 10 percentage points than the Latino/Hispanic gap of 60 to 40 percentage points.\n\n7. Global household inequality across wealth quintiles is far greater than inequality by ethnicity. Inequality by ethnicity is higher than inequality by gender or country.\n\n8. For wealthy North American women in 2017, the median wealth was $29,200 but for men it was $1.2m. And globally, women and men in wealthier countries had similar median (mean) household wealth: in the US, at $91,400; UK at $81,400; Germany $68,000; Switzerland, $57,400.\n\n9. Overall, gender inequality appears to be greater in countries with greater economic inequity between people of different race/ethnicity, as, for instance, in North America.\n\n10. In North America, people of colour tend to live in the poorest areas where they are less likely to have the resources to move into the middle class. The overall income inequalities in North America, at 9.2:1, were higher even than between countries, i.e. in Germany (4.7:1), Japan (3.5:1), South Korea (4:1) and Switzerland (3:1), where income inequalities between gender or ethnicity are less pronounced.\n\n11. Within any country, within regions including gender, race/ethnicity and caste or occupation, for instance, the poor are likely to be women, rural, not highly educated, not employed in agriculture or in services (i.e. mostly women and people of colour).\n\nAnd within any country or region or occupation, for instance, male doctors are more likely to be men but most women in rural Africa and India are farmers.\n\nIn some regions, like the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the gender gap is closing for the better educated while women still lag behind even more disadvantaged men in the poorest states.\n\n12. Women in Europe are also disadvantaged or have similar (or even slightly higher) inequalities than men. For example, in France, the gap in employment pay between men and women in 2017 was around 5.3 to 1, the same as in Greece or Russia.\n\nIn 2017, the highest proportion of men employed in the informal sector of economies worldwide was found in the US (48%) and in the UK (25%), while women’s share of employment in informal activities is highest in Turkey (62%).\n\n13. The share of women in the highest skilled categories, i.e. STEM, has remained flat globally and is on average at 22%, the same as in India, Vietnam and China.\n\n14. The share of women in low skilled/low income work is around half that of men (50-60% vs. 20-30%) in North and Latin America in developed countries, in the Middle East and North Africa and most countries in Southern sub-Saharan Africa, a reflection of women’s overrepresentation in lower skilled/lower income occupations.\n\n15.

So, once the do_something function is done it has a value you can use in Handler.main.\n\nThere is a function called with that we can pass to the Handler struct. That function is also called with &mut Handler.main. And finally, there is a let declaration at the end to assign the name value to the newly declared variables that will be used throughout the program.\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot going on there. I won’t go too deep into types, for now, you should just be aware that the types of things don’t matter when using the borrow checker. It needs some kind of data to run off of, and using pointers is just fine for that.\n\nOk, what else?\n\nAll right! So, this code snippet was super long and it didn’t really tell you what the Handler does. That can change your life because if you’re familiar with rust, you can actually just take that entire struct and implement the methods on it. That’s called “borrowing.”\n\nBut, to do that, we actually have to look at how and why the borrow checker is so great. And, that means getting into some kind of deeper understanding of where borrow checker came into being, right?\n\nWell, let me tell you…\n\nFor an in-depth look at this, check out: Understanding the Rust Borrow Checker, Part II: Rustc Borrow Checker is Real Time | Part II: How the Rustc Borrow Checker Work\n\nI’m not going to go too in-depth in this article, because I plan on doing several other articles in the Future Rust Series. I want this to be the last article just to cover the basics of the borrow checker and Rustc. And, besides, I’ve shown you enough of how the borrow checker is implemented by going into super detail about the borrow rules!\n\nI hope this helps and this article was informative for you!\n\nIf you were following along, you should have everything you need to create a full working application at the end of this article.

{"text": "we derived the distance to the central region of the Milky Way by fitting 2–D spatial models to the observed rotation curve and found a best-fit distance of Rc = R(Cen A) = 4.8kpc (@kranich:2003). If true, this would confirm predictions of the dynamical model based on the Milky Way structure for the formation of the Centaurus group (@kroupa:1991). An extended discussion of this result is given in the paper by @kranich:2003.\n\nThe main difference of our method compared to those in other articles which use the method of @debattista:2002 is that we try to solve for a 3D model in general, and not only when the stellar system is assumed to be in dynamical equilibrium with the central potential of the dark matter potential. The advantage of our model is that we can test the dynamical stability of the system. We are able to quantify the effect of changing the number of orbital periods on the stability of the system for an example parameter space. The results agree well with predictions from the stability arguments based on @merritt:1999.\n\nThe structure we derived for Centaurus A is in agreement with previous results such as N-body models of @binney:1984, and self-consistent models of the Centaurus Cluster presented in @bekki:2002. It would be very interesting to apply our model to other clusters. We are able to calculate the mass of the system simply by comparing the projected mass along the line of sight with the total mass of the system. The results show that, while Centaurus A is a well-determined system from a kinematic point of view, there is a significant amount of mass outside the observed velocity field that must be modeled in order to improve the overall fit in the radial mass distribution.\n\nThe work presented in this paper is part of the PhD work of @pfenniger:2005 at the University of Cologne.

{"text": "we report a microfluidic device for rapid and efficient concentration and enrichment of virus for nucleic acid amplification. This device consists of silicon wafers (∼50 µm) bearing microfluidic network structures that were fabricated by a rapid and high-throughput fabrication method based on femtosecond laser patterning and micropatterning. Each silicon wafer contains at least 100 (and usually 2000) parallel channels with ∼50-nm gaps that function as micropores and as channels in the fabrication process. The channels were microfabricated by three key process steps: pre-fabricated mold, laser patterning, and etching. In the molding step, photoresist micropatterns were transferred to silicon wafers using a UV-based direct laser engraving process in a rapid, one-shot operation. In the laser patterning step, we applied a femtosecond laser to pattern a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) block. In our fabrication process, a PDMS mold with ∼1 µm wide and ∼50 µm long patterns was first fabricated using the SU-8 as substrate by a UV-based photolithography process. The SU-8 mold was then used as the substrate in the following laser patterning process. Under the condition of an optimum femtosecond laser power, we obtained a patterned PDMS block containing submicron channels with a constant 50-nm gap and ∼50 µm width. Then, the PDMS block was carefully released from the SU-8 mold by the release agent of OTS (Octadecyltrichlorosilane). The PDMS block contained features of submicrometer to several micrometer sizes. The PDMS block was bonded and sealed to a new, untreated, silicon wafer. Then, the PDMS block was peeled off from the SU-8 mold and the bonded PDMS block was baked to remove any OTS solution that remained on the SiO2 surface. In the etching step, channels were formed in silicon by etching the silicon wafer, and the PDMS block was finally bonded to the etched silicon wafer.\n\nTo show the suitability of our device for PCR-based detection methods, we determined the binding capacity of the fabricated device by measuring the number of particles (50- to 100-µm in diameter) that can be trapped in the fabricated device. The results showed that the fabricated device had a binding capacity of ∼3×106 particles ([Fig. 1B](#fig_001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Next, we determined the efficiency of virus purification using the fabricated device. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) virions, a typical enveloped DNA virus, and human polyomavirus *sim* (HPyV *sim*), a naked DNA virus, were used as test viruses and their purifications were performed in a volume of 250 µL and in a time of 15 min. First, 10 µL of the purified virus/plasma mixture were added to 8 µL of each virus diluted by ddH~2~O (1:5) and the viruses were captured in the fabricated device. Then, the captured viruses were eluted by adding 250 µL of the PCR buffer. The eluted viruses were then applied to 3% agarose gel in phosphate-buffered saline containing ethidium bromide. By visual inspection, the purified virus mixture showed clear bands corresponding to the expected size of each purified virus ([Fig. 1Ba, c, e](#fig_001a){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Also, the purified virus mixture was confirmed by PCR after purification using the fabricated device ([Fig. 1C](#fig_001a){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\nNext, we determined the minimum sample volume and detection limit of the fabricated device. For this purpose, Hepatitis C virus-specific antigen (HCV-Ag) was used as the sample and purified by the fabricated device as mentioned in Methods. The purified HCV-Ag was diluted in a volume to 5% of the total viral sample, and the samples were then applied to the fabricated device ([Fig. 1D](#fig_001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). A 5-µL sample was loaded to the fabricated device and eluted in the same volume as the input sample. The eluted and the loaded volume were then used as the input and the eluted volume, respectively. The detection limit of the fabricated device was determined from the titration of the virus concentration in the input sample as 5 × 10^3^ particles/mL and the limit of detection (LOD) was 5 × 10^2^ particles/mL.\n\nTo show the stability and the capability of PCR as an amplification technique in our developed device, we tested the performance of the fabricated device and a silicon", "label": "gptj"}

The mobile handset maker has planned to launch a series of Jio promotional offers to be linked to smart phone customers, starting with the ‘Bharat Swabhishek’ or ‘Swachh Bharat’ initiative. “Jio’s vision is to provide India a world-class connectivity solutions for the emerging internet lifestyle. At Jio, connectivity is key and at the heart of its vision to connect is the key product called JioPhone,” Arvind Gupta, Managing Director, Intex Technologies told IANS.\n\nThe JioPhone will be part of the Rs. 494 million (approx. $7.5 million) Intex plan unveiled in September last year. It is scheduled to be available in the fourth quarter of the current financial year.\n\n“A JioPhone has become a symbol of Jio. There are more than 4 million Jios connected to different ecosystems at the moment. The JioPhone is the best of its kind, the very first smartphone from a reputed company which can act as a modem to connect to any ecosystem, any network, anywhere in India or around the world,” Arvind Gupta said.\n\n“A JioPhone is a milestone for Intex too. The company has been in hardware business for 30 years and it is also building a strong service centre business with more than 5,000 retail outlets. And, today, we have come up to a different point with an idea of integrating JioPhone and our retail infrastructure. With this, our company and Intex is set to become a different brand,” he added.\n\nThe JioPhone will be available through about 3,000 retail outlets, including JioMart stores across India and Intex.\n\nJio has already completed testing JioPhone with the telecom operator through which they worked on the performance of the handset. The JioPhone is expected to be the highest-ever selling smart phone in India in 2016 with more than a million launches, Gupta said.\n\n“This year, we believe the JioPhone will become the most popular choice in the country,” he added.\n\n“JioPhone is the best of its kind, the very first smartphone from a reputed company which can act as a modem to connect to any ecosystem, any network, anywhere in India or around the world,” Arvind Gupta.\n\nThis is the first time that a phone with a built-in modem is being put to be used only by Jio subscribers as the company is only open to sell the device directly to Jio subscribers, who will be first to use the JioPhone. The device will, however, be made available to other mobile operators in the coming months, he said.\n\nJioPhone is a new category smartphone that is being unveiled for the first time by Intex in India, Gupta noted.\n\n“JioPhone is not being developed by Intex. Jio will be first to launch it, then market it, and then sell it across the country along with their 4G service called Jio4G, which is still under test, will be launched in 2017,” he added.\n\n“We are going to launch JioPhone and Jio4G together as Jio wants to become the first mover and first to launch the country, then to run it across the country,” Intex Technologies Vice President (Business Strategy) Pritiraj Bose told IANS.\n\nThe smartphone will sell for just Rs. 509 ($7.45) which is a discount of Rs. 100 and a maximum of up to Rs. 2,999 (approx. $43.60) on payment of Rs. 7,999 ($117.70) for JioPhone. This is Rs. 450 lesser than the price of iPhone 6 ($650 in the US or 4,999 rupees at current exchange rates) and iPhone 6 Plus ($740).\n\n“The lower cost will give a major boost to the phone. The cost will go down further after the roll out of Jio4G” said Bose.\n\nIntex is looking to expand in the mid-tier smart phone segment and will be launching low-cost smartphones after its launch of a new brand called GionX. Under the GionX, Intex will offer low-cost feature phones from just Rs. 999 for a variety of plans for basic, popular and advanced features.\n\n“We will launch GionX in the coming months and then focus on smartphones. JioPhone can be the first launch, as we already have the manufacturing capability with the launch of GionX”, said Bose", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "This is an interesting, hard to find movie from the mid '30s about a boy orphaned during a war, who finds a home at the old hotel, which has been abandoned since before the war. The owner, a cranky old lady named Mrs. Tilton (Mary Pickford), sees the boy as a burden. Meanwhile, various people come to stay at the hotel, one of them a sadistic soldier who has no place to go (Robert Cummings). This story is a little slow and predictable until the last 10 minutes, when the boy finds out that he has an older brother who was killed in the war and is buried in France. From then on things pick up. This is a must see. It has the advantage of being made before World War II (so everyone is the age they are supposed to be), and the music is very good. This was director Jack Conway's only feature. It seems that he had other things he wanted to do and left the project. This is probably an even better movie for young children than it was for adults. It is certainly more of a kids movie than other movies of its age. The music is good, and the sets are good. I don't like the ending of this movie, though. I would have liked to have seen it all the way through. This movie came out in late December of 1935 and is available on video.\n\nThis is a weird one. Set in Europe before World War II, the action revolves around a woman, Maria, who meets a blind violinist who is working as a laborer for some local peasants. He falls in love with her and then kills himself, which she finds out about. The peasants blame her for his death, so she runs away into the mountains. Eventually a young German army officer helps her escape from the peasants' vengeance. It's basically a retelling of Cinderella. The action is kind of slow moving, the story is pretty typical for the time, and the characters are kind of stereotypical. The best (or worst, depending on your viewpoint) thing about the movie is the score. The score was composed by Franz Waxman, who later became famous for his scores for the \"Casablanca\", \"Meet Me in St. Louis\", and \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" films. He also wrote a song (\"Love Is Strange\") that is in the movie.\n\nThis is a very romantic movie. It was directed by Victor Sjostrom and starred Greta Garbo and Emil Jannings.\n\nThe plot, if you can call it that, goes like this: the hero - a young Swedish man (Emil Jannings) and his fiance - a beautiful girl (Greta Garbo) who is engaged to a much older, rich man - is working on his own father's farm, the home of his fiance, when a young woman with a very old face and gray hair and a girl of about 19 appear on the scene and ask for shelter and food. He agrees to let them stay, but is surprised when the young woman tells him who she is and he seems to believe her. They spend some time together at the farm, where he meets her daughter and where he first meets the fiance as she comes to visit his father. But her daughter tells them about the fiance, and as the fiance has been very rude to the young man's fiance and the fiance is now jealous of the daughter - especially after hearing she's going to marry the older man - the fiance is ready to kill everyone who gets in the way of his own plans. The girl leads him to a hidden cellar where her father and his friend are living in a cellar in a cave. On the way there, the fiance, the girl and her fiance's father get into a fight but he kills the man he thinks is his father and throws him to a river and then kills the girl's fiance who he thinks is there. Then he leaves. The girl - her daughter - helps the poor people at the farm and later meets young man as she is leaving with her daughter and they walk home together to the fiance's house. As they are walking, he sees his fiance in the distance and goes after her. She is not happy to see him, as she's mad he didn't believe his father was actually alive as the girl in the forest told them, and he doesn't believe her because he has another daughter, not the one she told him about earlier. But they do believe each other when they talk and then they kiss and she asks him to marry her and they go away together.\n\nThis is a beautiful movie, and it was made in 1937.\n\nThis is a fun movie, made in 1937. It is set in the mid-1800s in Germany, during the beginning of the industrial revolution. It tells the story of an upper class German girl, who was put in a convent to prevent her from marrying a man she did not want, and how one day she is chosen to marry him (", "label": "gptj"}

And it's bad for the lungs, like tobacco. But unlike tobacco, it's a cheap drug that has been used as a recreational drug throughout time and is legal in many countries. Some claim it can treat many medical conditions, from ADHD to depression and pain. But can't it be harmful as well as good?\n\nThe authors of this book explain the science behind marijuana. They cover its history, what makes it different and similar to other recreational drugs, its benefits and risks, and how it can affect the human nervous system. They address questions like: What is the difference between marijuana and cannabinoids? What is marijuana's risk for dependence?\n\nWhat is the science behind marijuana? Where did the word \"weed\" come from? The first known record of smoking cannabis was discovered as early as the sixth century BC in China. The word \"marijuana\" originated as \"mari' a name used in the ancient Maya language for the \"sacred drug\" that was used during certain rituals. In 1406 the Spanish Conquistador Hernan Cortes was the first European to use the term marijuana. The word marijuana came from the word for this \"new, powerful, intoxicant substance\".\n\nThe drug was introduced to Spain in 1532 by Hernan Cortes (1485-1547) when he brought the plants to Mexico. The Spanish crown prohibited the new intoxicant in 1605. Marijuana was reintroduced to Great Britain in 1629. It became an illegal drug in 1835. Some countries continue to ban marijuana: The United States, Australia, Pakistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Sudan. In some countries it became legal: The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Canada, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Scotland, Ireland, Finland, Switzerland, Norway and Greece.\n\nThe first botanical and medical use of marijuana dates to ancient China. Marijuana became a source of income and pleasure for the Chinese. It was used for a number of medical purposes, and also became sacred to some Chinese peoples. In the eleventh century, marijuana was introduced to Mexico. In the early colonial period, marijuana was used in many cultures, from Europe to South America. Many civilizations around the world cultivated marijuana for its uses. In the ancient Mayas and Aztecs, and the Incas, it was used primarily as a narcotic or recreational substance.\n\nWhen Spanish Conquistador Hernan Cortes introduced marijuana to the Americas, he named this new intoxicant after this new “new powerful drug.” The word marijuana was created from the Mayan/Toltec root. The ‘mara’ in ‘maya’ is the word for a drug that was taken during sacred ceremonies. The ‘manna’ in Marijuana means \"strength\" or \"power”. The word marijuana came from the Mayan word “mara:man” meaning “to kill” and “man:ana” meaning “strength” and “mara:man“. the word marijuana was first used in 1428 by the Spaniard and Conquistador, Hernan Cortes, who wrote a letter to the Spanish king, and used the word a few times in his letter, to refer to an \"intoxicating drug\", he also introduced the name “marijuana” in New Spain, to what later became Mexico. Hernan Cortes named this \"new intoxicating drug\", which he brought from the \"East Indies\" in his letter to the king of Spain in 1428, “mari' ” [the Mayan word for a sacred drug that is used in rituals].\n\nCannabis (the chemical name is cannabinol), is considered by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to be a drug which is used to treat specific conditions including “gout", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "However, this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy pitching him as a radical democrat and a transcendentalist and many of his political writings were inspired by transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nWhile his book Civil Disobedience is a collection of essays written by Thoreau over the course of his career it is the first, most famous, and least scholarly of these essays that is considered to be his classic and is a primary source to this day. In the essay, Thoreau declares that the state can legitimately exist only so long as it guarantees rights to a man's person and property. It can not legitimately compel its citizens to do things outside of their personal or economic interest. His ideas are in opposition to that of the state and a form of civil disobedience. Thoreau did not like the way people were treated by the state and he refused to take its money. This led to a criminal conviction for his refusal.\n\nThoreau believed in and practiced what is called laissez-faire economics. He said, \"Economics for the most part is a dismal science. It teaches that man can thrive only in association with one, or at most, two other entities; that he is dependent upon one or two other living beings; that the one entity or the two entities, that is, human association, are his masters; and that therefore this association is the natural and normal and only one, namely, nature. It is a science that has made us free, but it has almost made a slave of us.\" In fact, many of the things ThOREAU said, I say.\n\nThe key word here is \"freedom\". He said, \"But what is there of us that is not a part of nature? Our thoughts, our affections, our instincts, our reason, our will, our powers of imagination, we have all of these in common with the other animals. It is true, we have somewhat special ones, I grant. But, what is more, they are all the creatures have; not one of them is possessed by another; they may all be, and often are, in conflict; they must sometimes give way to others whose powers are more superior to them; yet all that they may do, all the different things they may make for themselves, by the use which they see fit to put them to, is absolutely free and not in the slightest degree subject to an order of a higher nature, whether human or supermundane.\"\n\nIn \"Civil Disobedience\", Thoreau wrote, \"What we have once enjoyed we can not take away from others\". But the fact that some people are homeless, hungry, sick, jobless, and/or oppressed, is the way Thoreau and Thoreau's fellow transcendentalists felt that should be remedied.\n\n1. According to the World Wide Web, Thoreau supported the abolitionist movement and was involved in a number of antislavery meetings.\n\n2. A year before he died, Thoreau was charged with violation of a state law for refusing to pay his poll tax. In a famous example of civil disobedience, he was arrested for this infraction and jailed. Thoreau was eventually fined.\n\nA couple of months ago, my wife and I came across something called a \"solar oven\" while browsing the internet. Now I'm not an expert on the topic but I know enough to understand that a solar oven is something that cooks food by harnessing the power of the sun. So, naturally, I started doing some research into this thing.\n\nFirst, what is the function of a solar oven? Simply put, it's a cooking device that is powered by the sun's rays so it doesn't require electricity to function. According to one online resource, \"A solar oven may be used just like a conventional oven... except the sun is an infinite energy source, much like the heat of the sun in an oven on earth, the sun is infinite energy source that cooks food\". While a regular oven cooks food by using electricity, it is this function of a solar oven that it's \"off the grid system\" and uses the sun to cook using its power.\n\nSo how does a solar oven do this? I can only speak for what I understand. So let's say that you are baking something like pancakes. Normally to make that happen, you'd need an electric oven which requires 120v of electricity to function. However, if the solar oven is used, all it needs is the sun's rays to function. This means you can still cook and bake and cook pancakes and stuff without an electricity bill each month.\n\nI know most of you, particularly those who own your own home, are probably curious as to the quality of the solar oven I'm talking about. A quick check of its specs say that it outputs 500°F. This means that the solar oven must cook with a temperature of over 500°F to work. There", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "physical geometry studies mutual disposition of geometrical objects and points, the\nsubject is included in geometry studies (which itself is included in\nmathematics studies).\nOne of the main difference between mathematics and geometry at this\nstage is that in mathematics the point (as an abstract) becomes merely a\nsymbol that represents the concept of zero and one, while in geometry\nits position is well defined by axioms of Euclid and this position is\ncorrelated with all other geometrical objects like lines, planes and\nspheres.\n\nAnother example of early studies of mathematics, which is a kind\nof geometry, is mathematics of astronomy that was conducted during the\nperiod of 4th century BC. In 4th century BC, mathematicians like\nAnaximandros (born about 370 BC) studied celestial motions or the\nlaws of motion of celestial bodies (i.e, the universe). They studied\ncelestial motions of the earth, moon and the Sun. But later in the\nhistory the focus was shifted to the calculation of the distances and\nobservation of the planets (which are more important than the laws of\nmotion of the celestial bodies). Therefore the major branch of\nmathematics called astronomy (or \"matho-physics\") came into existence.\n\nEuclid wrote the mathematical treatise called Elements in Alexandria\nthat is more than 2000 years old. It was the basis for further\ndevelopment of geometry. Euclid defined geometry by two fundamental\naxioms, axiom 1, the definition of a line and axiom 2, the definition of\nplane. He also gave the rules to obtain various other geometrical\nobjects like point, perpendicular line, circle, parallel and perpendicular\nlines, plane, line segment, triangle and many other. The other\ndefinitions and theorems of Euclid's Elements laid the foundations\nof modern geometry.\n\nIn spite of these developments, for some very important reasons,\nthere were no major developments of mathematical methods in the\nmathematics until the beginning of 20th century. (For example,\nno proper axiomatic approach existed.) And even then there was no\nsystematical development of the major branches of mathematics\nlike number theory or complex analysis. For instance, number\ntheory is a fundamental branch of mathematics and it was an\nimportant part of the studies of mathematics in late 19th\ncentury. But there was no proper axiomatic approach in the\ndevelopment of number theory.\n\nThere were few developments in the field of arithmetic\nfor some important historical reasons also. The main reason for\nthis was the major discovery of the fact that the traditional\narithmetic could not serve as a bridge to connect various\nbranches of mathematics. Therefore number theory which was to be\nmore extensive in its field could not progress.\n\nThe reason for\nnon-progression of the field even though there was a major\ndiscovery in number theory is that it was impossible to\ndiscover an elementary proof of the major theorem of\nnumber theory called (Goldbach's hypothesis).\n\nThere were no proper axiomatic systems and there was no\nmajor discovery in the field of analysis during the\nperiod of late 19th century.\n\nAxiomatic approach is a system in which certain rules,\nassumptions, and definitions are set forth in order to\nprove a body of knowledge. This is a basic method of\nmathematical research. There were some developments of\nsystematic approach in analysis and it is often stated\nthat \"the development was initiated by the development\nof axiomatic\". This is only part of the whole truth, which\nis that there was no proper development of the field. Anaximandros\nintroduced the theory of continuity but he could not justify it\nfrom an axiomatic point view. It is not possible to give a\nproper axiomatic system when we talk about continuity and\nlimits. (For example, how can we introduce the concept of\nlimit using axiomatic method.?) So the axiomatic development\nwas not carried out.\n\nAnother example of the non-axiomatic mathematical studies\nis that from the time of Pythagoras to the time of late 19th\ncentury there was no proper development of the axiomatic\nprocedure of proving the theorem of Pythagoras. (Mathematicians\nsuch as Gauss developed their own individual versions of\nproofs in some cases and some of them were able to prove\n\"Pythagorean theorem\" using proper proofs. But the\nmajority of these proofs were not acceptable from a\nmathematical point of view.)\n\nAnother important example in the history of mathematics is\nthat, despite the major developments in algebra by\nGalois and De La Valette, the development of abstract\nalgebra could not progress because of (i) the fact that there\nwas no proper ax", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "we study the effects of strong electron - electron interactions on the ground-state phase diagram and superconducting properties of the superconducting topological insulator. To this end, we apply the density matrix renormalization group method to the Hubbard model in the presence of a staggered magnetic field. The existence of nontrivial magnetoelectric transition in the spin-orbit coupled topological insulator has been recently found by the authors in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The ground-state phase diagram at the electron density n=1 and a fixed Rashba spin-orbit coupling $\\alpha=0$ is studied. At fixed magnetic flux and electron density, the phase transition can be divided into four phases: metallic, Nambu metal, topological insulator and superconductor. We also determine the superconducting gap and the edge structure of the system in the proximity of the transition boundary. We note that the phase transition can be tuned by Rashba spin-orbit coupling.\n\nWe also study the effects of electron - electron interactions by using the random phase approximation (RPA). We find that the enhancement of the spin-induced charge imbalance by an external electric field leads to an additional phase transition from metallic to topological metallic phase with increasing electron interaction.\n\nFinally, we study the density dependence of the superconducting order parameter $\\Delta _{sc}$, the density - and spin-dependent effective Zeeman fields $H_{x}^{i}$ and $H_{y}^{i}$ at the transition line from metallic to topological superconductor, when $H=0$, in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We determine the density dependence of $\\Delta _{sc}$, $H_{x}^{i}$ and $H_{y}^{i}$ for n=0.1 and $H=0$, for two different strengths $U/W_{0}=0.1$ and 0.01.\n\nIn short, our study provides a comprehensive phase diagram for the spin-orbit coupled spinful topological insulator with spin-polarized superconductivity in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.\n\n**Acknowledgments**.

{"text": "3rd UPDAT E 6:10 PM: NBC is wrapping its first night of the Olympics by announcing the live-TV ratings for Wednesday, July 23, 2012. NBC won in total viewers (19.6 million), but CBS (17.5 million) won in the demographic that matters for advertisers — the advertiser-friendly 25-54-year-olds (10.7 million). ABC (14.8 million) did third.\n\nThe last few days of NBC’s Olympics have been a mixed bag for the Peacock — one of its worst nights of the Games has happened to be one of its most-watched on network TV (Wednesday, Wednesday). A re-run of Bob’s Olympic hockey team, Saturday night’s primetime had just 2.1 million viewers — with a 1.3 million peak — as well as 627,000 adults 18-49. It was the least-watched Olympics primetime among adults 18-49 since May 2005. Sunday’s primetime had 2.1 million viewers and a 1.2 rating 18-49.\n\nNBC pulled no punches on Monday evening, going with the best story by a long shot: the drama surrounding a Russian athlete’s positive drug test. During the opening ceremony, NBC took off its top three TV shows (including football, which was in reruns on the NBC OTA Network) and had the live telecast of swimmer Ryan Lochte winning gold for the United States in the 400 free (he’d been fifth in prelims). That was a nice counter-programming idea. If that hadn’t happened when they did, the telecast would have been a mess as Lochte ran under the water in the semifinals and then hit the deck as a result of a dive and was brought out by his teammates — there was a long commercial break during the last moment of that race. It’s a great event that deserves that kind of exposure.\n\nAt 8, NBC’s Sochi Olympics opening ceremonies — complete with a spectacular water show and some dramatic music — drew 31.5 million viewers, but that was 2 million viewers fewer than the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin — where NBC, which lost out in the bidding, had been a distant second. Also on Sunday afternoon, NBC did an hour of Olympics-related coverage, and it averaged 7.6 million viewers, and a 1.8 rating in the 18-49 demo. The Bob Costas primetime specials, however, had 10 million viewers and a 2.3/6 in the demo.\n\nThis was a strong 7.25 million live-plus-seven-day-evening viewership, with the three NBC night shows going for 23, 16, and 15. One interesting thing is that the opening ceremony did a 10.7/27 on NBCSN — nearly a third of the live-plus-7 viewership. With the Olympics, the bulk of the action is on Sunday with the opening and closing ceremonies, and then a number of medal-race swims during the Wednesday night coverage. The figure below illustrates the mix (all of the Olympic coverage, except for Olympic highlights, plus NBCSN’s primetime specials since they’re part of live programming).\n\nRatings for NBC (live-plus-7) Day of Games coverage and primetime specials for Thursday to Sunday, NBC, 2012 Olympics\n\nSource: ShowBuzzDaily 6:04 PM: We’ve learned a bit more about the viewership for the NBC Universal-owned company’s Sochi Olympics opening ceremonies (July 9), which had a whopping 15.5 million viewers. That’s a solid number for any Olympics opening ceremony on network TV — which puts them in the top 15 since the 1996 Summer Games, according to Sports Business Daily.\n\nThe ceremonies, which took place at the Fisht Stadium in the Black Sea, were hosted by Bob Costas, and included skaters performing, gymnasts, a parade, figure skater Katarina Witt (whose husband is a Russian figure skating Olympian) and an Olympic flame on the ice, among a few others.\n\n“We’d like to thank each and every one of you who came out tonight in our opening ceremony on NBC and on NBCSN,” Costas, 56, says in a video greeting. “This is the world’s biggest audience for a TV broadcast.” Costas later joked, “I really love that we are an international broadcast. I like the foreign language and the languages we don’t speak that much.”\n\nSome of Sochi’s big ticket advertisers have already signed on: Hyundai, MasterCard, Visa have deals in place with NBC, and McDonald’s has a national advertiser buy on the opening ceremony through its Dollar Menu in TV, radio, and outdoor.

{"text": "The other major method of producing O 2 gas involves the use of a thermal decomposition of the halogen molecule(s) in a carrier gas. This method can be carried out at relatively higher pressures (1- 10 atm) and is suitable for producing pure O 2 from the halogen dioxide sources. This method, when carried out at lower temperatures, gives rise to the formation of other product species. The reaction of the halogen with the carrier gas has been used to advantage in the purification of gases (PCT Int. Appl. No. WO93/20694) and in various gas generation processes (Cf. U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,071).\n\nOne of the major difficulties encountered with thermal decomposition of halogen monoxide involves the formation of the thermal decomposition products which are mostly solid and thus form deposits on the surfaces of the reactor and the equipment which carries out the reaction, especially when an adiabatic reactor is used. Moreover, if reaction takes place above the melting point of the thermal decomposition products, the reactants also form a liquid phase which is difficult to separate from the solids. The solid phase of the products can clog the reaction zone of the reactor by interfering with the flow of gas. The gas phase of the reaction products is usually not useful.\nThe formation of solid products as a solid film on the walls of chemical reactors is a long standing problem for which many solution has been attempted without total success.\nThere is a general understanding in the art that the solid products can be prevented or substantially reduced from depositing by adding one or more inert solids or solids containing refractory oxides to the halogen monoxide stream. An improved method and apparatus to avoid or substantially reduce the formation of solid products in the reactor zone by minimizing the residence time of the feed gas in that zone is now being achieved because of the discovery of a novel solid product which is capable of preventing the undesirable formation of solid products and reducing or eliminating the deposition or fouling of refractory oxide solid particles on the reaction chamber walls or equipment. This invention therefore provides a new and novel method for preventing the formation of solid products in a system for the production of oxygen, fluorine and/or chlorine by gas phase pyrolysis of halogen monoxide gas feed.\nIt is therefore an object of this invention to provide a solid product generated by gas phase thermal decomposition of halogen monoxide that can effectively reduce foulant deposition and fouling of the surface of a reactor, for example, a continuous stirred tank reactor.\nIt is another object of this invention to provide a new and improved apparatus utilizing the disclosed solid product by generating a layer of the solid product on a portion of the reaction chamber of a chemical reactor and then introducing an inert gas stream to continuously flow through the solid layer so as to maintain the reaction and deposit of solids within a predetermined zone of the reactor.\nIt has been found that the solid product of this invention can be produced by contacting the halogen monoxide with a suitable solid material which preferably has a porosity ranging between about 20% and about 80% by weight and which preferably serves to absorb or hold on to the thermal decomposition products formed during thermal decomposition of the halogen monoxide. Generally, the amount of halogen monoxide in contact with the solid will be in the range of from about 5% to about 90% by weight based on the combined weight of the solid and the monoxide. Moreover, the reaction product in contact with the solid preferably should be in a fluid form or flow. It is preferred to produce the solid product in an aqueous, aqueous slurry or in the form of a slurry of the product in water or a carrier liquid. The slurry preferably contains less than about 5% by weight of an impurity which is a liquid (vapour or liquid) under the prevailing conditions of reaction.\nThe solid materials used in the methods of this invention to produce the solid product need to be capable of holding the solid generated during the thermal decomposition of the halogen monoxide, but preferably should not participate directly in the chemical reactions involved, thus reducing or avoiding any possibility of fouling or coking of the reactor or the reaction chamber walls. In the case of the use of sodium chloride and calcium chloride, the halogen monoxide will decompose into chloride gaseous species which are carried away by the inert gas stream flow. This results in the generation of the chloride solid product without any undesirable coke formation on the reactor walls. The solid product is preferably generated from solid material particles of a substantially similar size with a size from about 1 micron to about 100 microns or greater. The size is preferably less than about 5,000 microns because of the ease of fluidizing the solid material in a gas stream.\nThis invention therefore provides a new and novel method of preventing the formation of fouling deposits and undesirable deposits of solid products in", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "1983's \"\"Frightmare\"\" is an odd little film. The director seems to be a fan of the old Universal monster-movies, but this particular version feels more like a B-movie (even though the stars are actually better than some of his more standard B-movies of the era). And when a movie that is supposedly about an actual \"true-life story\" of a serial-killer shows too much of the actual event, that's just my opinion, you may have a different idea.\n\nThe story and characters\n\nLets look at the characters; this is \"based on a true-life story\".\n\nIvan Farras - A disturbed man with a wife and kids that has been locked in a basement for 18 years, he escaped and killed five more people before he was caught. He committed these murders by breaking in to the people's houses and killing them in their sleep. His wife had a dream in which he was in danger and this is how she knew he had a need to kill. She had a friend who lived along the same line, she also told a policeman who was going to avenge the first killed that same night he came looking for Ivan Farras, who he believed killed her husband. That night he broke into the house and killed two more people. The last he saw, Ivan was sitting by a gas stove and he heard a woman scream and fall. His last words to his friend were \"the baby's ok, the police weren't here.\"\n\nIvan Farras' wife - A woman who has no clue about his life outside the house, she only knew that he liked the movies, and has his favorite music on and they would sing and dance together. She is described as being beautiful and calm, the only reason she could escape from the house was because Ivan's son was born. A real life story? No.\n\nShe was an actress, she had worked on the film before Ivan got in (at least that's the excuse this guy gave to a woman's magazine of why she could escape)\n\n\"You mean I escaped because the baby was born? Are you kidding me? I got locked up so I could be a mother! He said no one was allowed to leave the house because he needed to feed the baby!\"\"\n\nShe is portrayed as a character who was in love with Ivan Farras, as they had a \"love match\" type relationship. She is supposed to be a victim, so that when the film starts, she is still in love with him. She is described as being calm. She is calm because she thought she was going to die, as she told the police she heard a scream. How much was this woman calm when she heard her husband trying to strangle her friend to death, and she even saw him kill 2 more before she could yell at him?\n\n\"She said a police man came, so it sounded like he knew who killed her husband, but I never took seriously that policeman. You know why? I think he was hiding behind a tree because I think he was looking out the window. I was never afraid of the police because it was stupid to be afraid. I was scared, that's all. I told him that the baby was crying, and we were in danger. He said he would be on the way.\"\n\nAnother lie; the policeman never even mentioned that the man who was killed was her husband (who was also killed)\n\n\"But I told him and I was sure he knew who killed us. I wanted to stay and see what he wanted to do, and maybe my baby would be ok. I was worried that they would think my husband killed it. But I told him that it was my baby who was crying. We didn't have enough money to take anyone to the hospital, and I thought maybe the baby only got a cold there was no one there.\"\n\nWhat if Ivan Farras, was never actually looking for a wife? What if he was just looking for someone who would let him hide in their home. He would have a wife who would love him, would be perfect as his \"wife,\" he wouldn't had to have a love match like her, he wouldn't had to spend so much money to take her to the hospital, and he wouldn't had the problem of not being able to kill her husband.\n\nThe man who broke into the house; He also escapes, he kills 2 more people and is caught.

A correlation between the strength of the broad - wing and the relative width of the fluorescent line is found at all energies. This confirms that the strong flux at high energies is caused by fluorescent iron 6.4 keV emission. 3. An additional narrow line is found at 7.03 keV, too weak for X - ray photons, but present in the optical data taken with a grating. This feature could be either due to He - lines originating in the disk wind or to O - lines originating in a jet. 4. Some additional narrow and emission lines that are present in the x - ray spectrum, however, are due to instrumental features, such as a calibration line, and are only significant in the MOS 2 data.\n\nWe thank Prof. Michiel van der Klis for suggesting the work presented here.

Sinatra is the main character, but that is what sets the game apart from the other Sinatra games. Instead, you get the new character, which has so many of the same problems. She’s a terrible thief and she makes no effort to be stealthy. The worst is her terrible timing. When you’re running, she can’t be heard by any of the guards because you’re going too fast. That leaves you open for the guards to catch you from behind or even attack you. She’s a lot of fun to play as, though.<br /><br />I’ve never had any problem with her “timing” and so far I enjoy playing thief more than in any other game. When someone calls for help, she can be stopped before she gets to the target to start a distraction.

{"text": "This movie was terrible. The plot was terrible and unbelievable. And it was very very slow. If you think about it this is the first movie that made me feel this way. Yes it was the first time i ever felt that the movies i was watching were very slow. And that was the case with this movie as well. Maybe it had something to do with it. I felt a bit irritated. I felt that we were just sitting and talking about nothing. The movie was all about this, this, and this. I mean what was the point of the movie? How was that supposed to end? I don't know, but i felt like we were just talking and watching. I knew it was about pirates, and about treasure searching. Well, no it was about pirates searching for treasure. I'm sorry, but i don't know what else you could say. It wasn't about anything. If there was a plot maybe I wouldn't have understood it, but I'm sure that if I had it wouldn't be a very good movie if there was a plot. I'm not making fun of the movie, I'm just trying to make sense of something.\n\nThere were two parts of the movie. These two parts are called: pirates, and, pirates. The movie was in a sense divided in two groups: The pirates, and, the pirates.\n\nBut, I still didn't like the pirates,\n\nI only liked the pirates in the first group, the one with the gold.\n\nThere were 2 or 3 ships to begin with. It was a crew of one captain, and 1 or 2 other people. But, there weren't too many ships.\n\nThen, there was the captain of the gold. He is the only one that doesn't have names.\n\nThen, there was the captain of the silver, then there was the captain of the bronze and finally, there was the captain of the iron.\n\nI liked the captain of the gold when he met the captain of the silver. Even though that meeting happened at the island, i like it when they met by mistake when they went to the island. We didn't like the sea at all.\n\nWhy was the movie all about pirates? No. It wasn't so much about pirates, since, the pirates, when we got to know them in the third part, in the end of the movies, they were just plain crazy. The movie was about a ship, and there was a treasure on it. I believe that maybe, i'm not sure, that there were more than one pirate. But, i think that the reason that the movie took so long was because they searched for the treasure. But, they couldn't find it. Maybe there wasn't enough men to do their work.\n\nThe movie also took a lot of time because they were talking about things that would make people happy. The pirates were talking to the people and they talked about the sea and the island and also a few things that made me happy. For instance, the man who was watching the water and the beach, the beach people. I liked them because they were nice and they had a nice life. I felt like they were enjoying life. Their life was very nice.\n\nThe movie could have been way better, if there was a plot.\n\nThere was a plot, but it was a lie. If there was a plot, it was the lie of this movie.\n\nMaybe it is the best pirate movie in the world. But, it isn't. It is definitely the worst movie i've ever seen. It is, and, i hate the pirates of this movie. I hate the pirates of this movie very much. And, if I had to come up with a reason of why I hated the pirates of the movie, it would be 'cause there wasn't a plot.\"\n\nThe movie was horrible. The whole thing took place on the island. They searched and searched and searched. Then they finally found the pirate gold. And, they were finally happy. No, it wasn't happy. It wasn't anything that could make you feel like, you were happy. It was very depressing. I just think that the movie was so bad because it wasn't good. Well, not good, it wasn't really a movie at all. It was a joke.\n\nI didn't get why they were chasing the pirate gold,\n\nThey were chasing the pirate one.\n\nIt wasn't a story that was good and believable. It was a story, that was a lie. I hated everything about the movie. First of all, the part that was filmed on the island. I hated the parts, that were filmed on the beach, the beach was so bad to look at, I felt that it was really bad. Everything that they filmed wasn't good. Like, there weren't any people on the streets. They weren't walking. It was all fake. I'm sure this movie", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent years comes out this week from indie producer/director Alexandre Aja that shows, for at least 90 minutes, why he’s a future Oscar contender, as well as a horror film legend.\n\nDirected by Laurent Cantet, the film opens with a gruesome video clip that plays into how the filmmakers have decided to open their story, depicting the violent murder of a man and his girlfriend. Cantet then cuts away to a voiceover from some doctor who’s explaining why that kind of gruesome image would be perfectly rational to someone suffering from a mental illness that can lead them to consider torturing people. As long as someone doesn’t blame the patient, he says, “It’s just about finding a way to justify what we did.”\n\nNext up is a character who’s not entirely sane himself, played by Edgar Ramirez, a former dancer who’s become convinced he’s on some kind of mission to protect his child from a violent future where everyone will be killed by a series of black monoliths. “My only purpose is to make sure my daughter will grow up in a society that is not one you and I had chosen here in the States,” he says. “It has nothing to do with the color of your skin, or your social status. The only difference is the deathrate. I choose to prevent as many people from dying as I can, by offering them the cure.” And that leads him straight to an asylum where he will be killed — but not before he has a conversation with a psychiatrist (Sarah Polley) and a young boy suffering from similar fears regarding violence.\n\nAll of this is accompanied by a lot of very, very good filmmaking. While I’m familiar with the director, Cantet, from a past project that dealt with cannibalism in a similarly dark and realistic way, and have reviewed the first trailer for this film, I felt the full length preview left me with a lot of questions that probably need to be answered in the film (I’ll get there, just a little later in the review). So I went to the theater last night to see it on the first night, and can report it was everything a horror fan could hope it’d be.\n\nAja has a great eye for framing and composition. He cuts between the different locations at a quick pace, building a narrative of intense unease as a sequence of events unfolds, never really letting you have a break for breathing. There’s one scene where Cantet shows an elderly woman having dinner with her sister (Maria Bonita) and is shown with an extremely strong zoom. By that point in the film, it’s been well established that both her sister and her husband have been murdered by a killer obsessed with black monoliths, with Bonita in the role of the young girl who saw them being killed and now is too scared to tell anyone what she sees. Later on, we’re shown in a flashback that the murders were recorded on video (using a telephoto lens to zoom in on the victim and its body) by a woman named Alice (Sarah Polley) — again, the same woman we’ve seen since she first arrived at the asylum. She later turns out to be a member of a secret group that’s trying to find a way to stop the monoliths. So why does a very powerful woman become obsessed with the murders and join what she hopes is a group that will ultimately help her find an answer to them?\n\nYou get the feeling that it’s going to be pretty dark material, and Cantet and company have delivered with some of the most disturbing imagery ever seen in any film. Most of the film’s violence comes from Ramirez’s character, and we also get a brief but brutal sequence involving a young boy named Theo. The boy, whose home life has been somewhat fractured from his parents’ divorce, has a fear of violence — he even carries a gun. At the beginning of the film, Cantet shows him looking into a mirror where he sees what looks like a black monolith behind him, and he starts to break down in sobs.\n\nTheo’s father (Antonio Banderas) arrives and looks through the boy’s closet, sees the gun and then gives his son an injection of tranquilizers — and in the process, an image is projected on the wall behind them. It’s a portrait of Alice and the man she’s dating — Theo’s father. At that point, the boy is fully sedated and the scene changes from the two of them to Alice looking through the boy’s closet, which is loaded with black monoliths, to the father entering the room and shooting himself.\n\nAnd that’s as", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "efficient phase cycling schemes remain a challenge for nmr techniques. The methodologies to perform multiple independent scans at different echo time delays have been developed only for the case of the standard one (^1^H) channel.

The approach we have developed to overcome this issue is the use of multiple-channel nmr.^[@ref38]^ The sample was transferred to the NMR spectrometer and the channel was tuned and matched by means of manual, manual-selective power cycling for each channel prior to acquisition of the data.^[@ref38]^ In [Figure [1](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, some examples of the experiments performed on selected spin-3/2 nuclei demonstrate how the proposed method works.

Some examples on multiple-channel nmr experiments to investigate the chemical shift and scalar coupling are reported at the beginning of this paper. (ii) The number of channels should be chosen to get the complete data set for the desired number of echoes. (iii) In some cases, in order to complete the set of multi-echo experiments for a given spin-3/2 nucleus, one has to use a long recycle delay *T*~*r*~ to obtain all the echoes from low-to-high-field recoupling, as indicated in [Figure [1](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C.

[Figure [2](#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}](#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows this sequence for the case of sodium and ammonium ions. First, the water is removed by the freeze--thaw cycle that exploits the freezing/boiling process to remove the remaining water. The sample is then transferred to the dry ice powder. This allows the removal of any air, water, and/or other volatile components in the initial liquid samples from the freeze--thaw cycle. Finally, a dissolution by boiling is performed,^[@ref40]^ which allows water removal from the sample.

The lighter colors are often more valuable in gemstones.\n\nCut and Size Diamonds\n\nDepending on the color, cut, and style, each diamond is graded and scored by Diamond Certification Laboratories (DCLS) using diamonds over 100 carats. The cut and symmetry determine the shape. These cuts, as well as a gem’s depth or height and diameter, are then combined to create a letter grade.\n\nComes down to what you want and what value you are prepared to pay..\nif it was cut from one of the finest mine it could cost millions of pounds..\nSo it's a combination of what the gemstone is, what gemologists call the “cut” of the gem, and what one might call the “eye appeal” or the appearance that it offers.

The gemstones are real and in the world of gems, they are \"priceless\".\nGemstones themselves are only interesting and valuable to a certain extent and \"eye appeal\" is a big part of the whole story.

Diamant is the chemical compound of the diamond which actually gets wet. Diamond is a very pure version of that compound.”\n- “So why do people call one a diamond and not the other?”\n- “Diamant has a different chemical formula. Both diamant and diamond contain carbon, but with different proportions.\n- “But they contain carbon how?”\n- “Well,\" I explain, “diamond as a crystal actually contains some of the carbon from the air that gets in the cracks of the rock, but diamant only contains carbon from the rock itself.”\n- “So diamonds come from inside rocks?”\n- “Yes, the whole Earth actually is made up of crystals, but most of them only contain minerals.

{"text": "Bootable Diagnostics CD for the Sun Fire V20z and Sun Fire T2000 servers]\nThis page describes how to create the Sun Fire V20z Bootable Diagnostics CD that will enable you to boot the server using Diagnostics CD and perform system recovery.\n\nCreate the CD for the V20z server\n\nUse the standard Sun Cluster client utilities to generate a V20z CD image.\n\nOn V20z and T2000 servers, use the command:\n\nscdctl-create\n\nThis will create the standard text-based CD image for a Sun Cluster client application.\n\nThe cdctl-create command will only work on Sun Fire V20z servers, so use scdctl-create or cdctl-create on T2000 servers.\n\nCreate the file /etc/system.cfg for the CD\n\nThe files for the diagnostics CD live in a common directory in a system.cfg file on the CD. You may use the utility toolcdctl-create to add the necessary parameters to CD. A common directory can be created in the file cdctl-add in that directory to help automate the process, by doing the following:\n\nCreate a file /etc/system.cfg.txt on the CD, and put the following text (including the comments) in the file, and save it. Then execute cdctl-add /etc/system.cfg.txt for the required parameters.\n\nThe file can be created using the vi text editor: vi /etc/system.cfg.txt. The following text is for the diagnostic CD for a Sun Fire V20z server. If you use that file, you can delete most of the original content. That text file must contain the following content:\n\nThis file must contain the contents of the cdctl-create file that was created in the previous step, with the addition of the above text file.\n\n[2] If another server is not available you may choose to use a disk image instead of the CD, to load the server's operating system from the disk.\n\nLoad the server operating system\n\nIf the server can use a disk image rather than the CD, load the cluster system server from the ISO image with the command:\n\nscd-install disk-image\n\nIf this command fails, the server does not have a disk image of a supported version of the Sun Cluster software, see SUn Cluster Supported Releases page. In such a case, the error message includes the date of the release in a later version release of the server. For example, on a V20z this would be:\n\nThe scd-install command can load the cluster system server from the ISO image disk, but you need to load the cd-bootdisk file instead. To do that, use the command\n\nscd-install iso-file\n\nStart the Cluster Networking Services on V20z and T2000 servers\n\nTo start the Networking Services (NSS for V20z, CNT for T2000)\nuse the command:\n\nscdstart-sshd\n\nOn the V20z and T2000 servers, this will create the cluster services file at /etc/ssh/sshd_config so you can start SSH services.\n\nAfter starting the cluster services, you can start or stop some of the servers using ssh.\n\nFor example, if you do not run a server on 127.0.0.1 (localhost), you can connect to another server on 127.0.0.1, or connect remotely to that server's IP address. Use these additional commands.\n\nIf you connect to 127.0.0.1, use\n\nssh 127.0.0.1\n\nIf you connect to the internal IP address of the system\n\nssh myserver:192.168.0.2/24\n\nIf you want to connect remotely to any of the V20z servers, use:\n\nssh myserver\n\nOn the V20z and T2000 servers, the Cluster service is running at port 11333, and the name service port is port 2223.\n\nStarting the Cluster Administration Services (scd-cluster-admin) on V20z and T2000 servers\n\nTo start the clustering admin services (scd-cluster-admin) on V20z or T2000 servers:\n\nOn T2000, the system will start the Cluster Administration Services directly. On V20z, if the scd-install disk-image command cannot be used, the scd-install iso-file command will start the necessary services on this server.

{"text": "objectivethe assessment of potentially confounding factors affecting colon microbiota composition and function \\[[@B6]\\].\n\nA major goal of this study was to assess the utility of 16S rRNA gene-based analyses (i.e., pyrosequencing of V3-V4 region) for monitoring human gut microbiomes in response to dietary intervention. The ability of the 16S rRNA gene-based analysis technique to capture changes in colonic microbiomes following dietary intervention has been suggested repeatedly. Such changes include a change in total number of bacteria (i.e., decreased colonic load), and changes in the relative quantities of bacteria within a single species. However, data obtained from studies focusing on dietary intervention are equivocal since the observed changes were inconsistent. For example, studies assessing dietary intervention on *Bifidobacterium*-dominated microbiomes showed that *Bifidobacterium* load is significantly higher following dietary intervention, but this increase was not accompanied by a decrease in overall load \\[[@B33]--[@B5]\\]. In addition, an increase in*Enterobacteriaceae* was observed following dietary intervention and was associated with a decrease in *Bifidobacterium* \\[[@B12], [@B33]\\].\n\nThe results of this pilot study provide the first observation of an increase in *Akkermansia* after intake of a gluten containing diet ([Figure 2](#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Although, the relative abundance of *Akkermansia* is not reported, high abundance of *Akkermansia muciniphila* has been shown to correlate with a significant reduction of *Bacteroides* load following dietary intervention \\[[@B32], [@B34], [@B15]\\].\n\n4.1. Changes in Human Colon Microbiome {#sec4.1}\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn an attempt to explain variations in findings obtained from 16S rRNA gene-based analysis of changes in human colon microbiota, two hypotheses are tested: (1) changes in the total number of cells (i.e., increased colonic load) following introduction of gluten-containing food leads to an increase in *Akkermansia* abundance, and (2) high variation in the methodologies used as well as the criteria for defining significant changes in human colon microbiota. It should also be kept in mind that in view of low relative abundance of *Akkermansia muciniphila* in the control group of this study, a large number of replicates was used and only five subjects were included in this pilot study to ensure sufficient statistical power. Thus, while the increase in *Akkermansia* in this study is not statistically significant, it does provide an important first step toward a more complete understanding of changes in human colon microbiota during nutrition intervention.\n\nThe findings of a significant increase in *Akkermansia* abundance observed in this study are not surprising, since an increased abundance of *Akkermansia* has been previously reported following dietary intervention in a study by Zhang et al. \\[[@B31]\\]. In addition, a recent report suggested a correlation between fecal concentrations of *Saccharomyces* and dietary fiber intake \\[[@B14]\\]. Since dietary fiber intake was controlled during this study, an increase in *Akkermansia* abundance following dietary intervention is consistent with an increase in dietary fiber intake \\[[@B14]\\]. Thus, it is plausible that increased fecal concentrations of *Saccharomyces sensu stricto* after introduction of gluten-containing products were in general association with an increase in dietary fiber intake, which in turn was associated with an increase in abundance of *Akkermansia*. In future studies, it will be important to evaluate total dietary fiber intake and dietary component intake, such as wheat fiber in the form of arabinoxylans and other indigestible dietary fiber.\n\nAn increase in *Akkermansia* was observed only following the intervention by a food which contained high amount of fiber and low glycemic index. Previous studies have suggested that *Akkermansia* increases following the introduction of diets rich in dietary fiber, both soluble and insoluble \\[[@B9], [@B29], [@B7]\\]. Interestingly, the only study that failed to find increases in *Akkermansia* following dietary intervention utilized a diet low in dietary fiber and high in glycemic index (35% of total calories in the form of starch, 50% of total calories in the form of sucrose and 15% of total calories in the form of refined table sugar) \\[[@B14]\\].\n\nChanges in the human colon microbiota following introduction of low-fiber diets have been linked to enrichment in potentially harmful bacterial strains in the colon with a corresponding increase in the number of *Enterobacteriaceae* \\", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world's history. What started out as a modest affair in the Italian piazza of Bergamo on New Year's Eve 1887 reached Broadway's Winter Garden Theatre six months later with the addition of an extravagant chorus line. As the new century approached, the Carusos continued to tour the United States and Europe, where they were received by royalty and their audiences were transfixed at their show's high drama and exotic appeal. The press, however, never warmed to Maria. \"I hate to say it, but it seems to me,\" remarked the New York Sun, \"that it is the most immoral show on earth.\"\n\nDespite such criticism the Carusos' show became an enormous phenomenon. For decades their names were synonymous with music hall. When the war finally ended, the Caruso Company returned to Italy and in 1925 the opera composer Ruggerio Leoncavallo composed a libretto, written by his wife Domenica Gilardoni, and premiered it in New York with Maria in the title role. Then, in 1927, at the urging of the US-based Caruso Society the New York Herald Tribune published a book, La Bella Figura (The Beautiful Figure), based on his correspondence with the tenor. After this, the Caruso Company returned to America, where they could again command the kind of money which had been made possible on Broadway by the Great War—which is more than anyone else made in the first half of the last century.\n\nOver the next few years the Carusos toured the United States, making numerous personal appearances, and gave many radio broadcasts, earning as much as a million dollars per year. In 1928 they moved to a New York apartment on the fashionable Madison Avenue at Eighty-fifth Street where they lived a life of comfortable opulence, entertaining guests and occasionally receiving foreign dignitaries at the apartment.\n\nThe Carusos were both famous and infamous. They were not simply opera superstars, they were also the subject of two best-selling biographies, The Caruso Story by Domenico Caruso and La Bella Figura: The Story of Arturo Caruso by Robert R. MacAdams. They both wrote for newspapers and published biographical sketches for magazines (including those for The Literary Digest and Vanity Fair), which contributed to the general image of the tenor as brash, vain, arrogant, egocentric, and vain. But the Carusos were complex, sensitive, and charismatic people, and on his rare occasions of public expression the tenor was anything but narcissistic. \"On stage and off,\" he told The Literary Digest in 1929, \"I am modest, kindly, and considerate. I speak the truth.\"\n\nA decade after he was known all over the world as the greatest singer of his time, the tenor was in great demand for personal appearances. He toured the United States constantly, singing, lecturing and signing copies of Autobiography of an Opera Singer. He was the toast of society. He entertained Princess Ileana of Romania who wrote in her diary, \"The Caruso home in New York is an artistic salon.\" His apartment in New York was the scene at two-a-day lunch parties. There he would sit at the far end of the table on a tall, straight chair and would listen intently to everyone else's words, then wait until everyone was quiet and say: \"No, you haven't heard my side of it yet. Now I want you to hear mine.\" In his book the famous American actress Katherine Lorring recalled:\n\nHe would be very much in humor, telling anecdotes about people, but he would keep the whole world's secrets, too.... He could be extremely charming. But you had to watch him because he would turn the charm on very quickly. You could see it go, and then you had a moment before... the other side would come out. And there was no getting out of it; it was something about you personally that he felt you had given too much.\n\nThe Carusos were also known as the Great Carusos. No-one was so modest as to mention the second Caruso. It seemed impossible that one individual could dominate the world with his voice and have not already appropriated the world for himself. His singing career was a phenomenon. And it came at a time when many singers in opera were beginning to fail. Enrico Caruso (no relation) would go on to create the standard for tenor singing as it had been known for at least 100 years before the twentieth century.\n\nThe voice of the Carusos—so powerful, so beautiful and so unique—resonated all over the world during their career as one of the great events of the age.

{"text": "Pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to recognize foreign molecules, usually pathogens, for immunity or defense. The most common types are transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, which are typically composed of an N-terminal, variable light chain variable domain (VL−VD), a short hydrophobic stretch, a hydrophobic or charged membrane-spanning domain, followed by a constant light chain variable domain (CL−VD) and a C-terminal, cytoplasmic tail domain ([@bib18]). The V domain of these receptors has three variable regions termed D, J, and C and a hypervariable region between and around VD and VJ (known as framework 2 (FR2) or complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3)). Several groups of organisms have evolved receptors with the same overall topology but different lengths and/or number of V domains ([@bib31]).\n\nThere are many types of PRRs with the same overall topology. They recognize microorganisms, parasites or injured tissue, and activate an immune response. This diverse set of receptors also recognizes molecules in the intracellular environment or in the extracellular matrix, including nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA, single-stranded RNAs and modified RNA, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs/glycoproteins), glycoproteins, nucleoproteins, lipoproteins, and peptides.\n\nThe largest group of PRRs consists of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize extracellular microbial motifs such as nucleic acids and peptides and signal to the immune system. For example, TLR1/2 recognizes triacylated lipoprotein and lipomycine, while TLR5 recognizes flagellin, and TLR3 recognizes double-stranded (ds) RNAs and certain synthetic dsRNAs ([@bib28]). Other PRRs involve pathogen recognition domains in larger, structurally distinct proteins with a role in pathogen identification or in signaling of the immune response. PRR domains include the following: (1) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, such as those of the Ig-superfamily, which are often called \"sushi\" domains; (2) Bacterial-S-layers (Bsl)-associated domains; (3) Bacterial-DNA-binding (BdB)-like domains, (4) RNA-binding (RNP)-like domains, (5) Fibronecrosis (Fn)-associated domains (fibronectin-type III and -type V domains), (6) galactosyl- and lipo-oligosaccharide (GAL/LPS)-binding domains (which recognize carbohydrates); (7) P-proteins, also named LRR-Proteins (LRR-PR1) or LRR-R-proteins; and (8) the recently identified pentraxins ([@bib3]; [@bib21]). These latter are structurally distinctive receptors of the complement system with a characteristic pentaxin fold, which include the pentraxins C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid P (SAP), and short pentraxin 3 (SAT3), as well as various novel pentaxin-like molecules identified by genomic approaches (Rey et al. 2005).\n\nMany mammalian TLRs share the same three-domain structure, but with variation in the CDRs of the V domain ([@bib25]); as an example, TLR1 has one VD, while TLR3 has three. The number of V domains varies from 12 in human *TLR2* ([@bib15]; [@bib12]) to seven in *TLR1* ([@bib13]) and nine in *TLR2* ([@bib24]).\n\nIn this study, we have screened nonredundant human cDNA libraries and identified a novel pattern matching receptor with 7 different V domains in two genes called *TLR7* (OMIM [600838](600838)) and *TLR9* (OMIM [600817](600817)).\n\nOne of the genes of this receptor, *TLR7*, has been isolated and sequenced as a part of two different studies, and an earlier analysis of its transcript suggested that it may be involved in the sensing of single-stranded (ss) and ds nucleic acids ([@bib12]; [@bib17]).\n\nThe TLR7 protein includes a VL-VD with 12 V domains of Ig superfamily, an unstructured insertion domain, and a VD of Ig superfamily.

A high-level concentration can cause a runaway reaction due to oxygen-nitrogen reactions forming high temperature compounds which may combust explosively. Oxygen-rich combustion environments are commonly encountered in combustion chambers, such as the combustion chamber of a gas turbine engine or combustion region of a rocket engine, and at combustion plumes resulting from the destruction of a military or commercial structure by fire. A runaway reaction within an oxygen-rich environment leads to an increase in the oxygen level to an extent which can cause the combustion environment to be explosive, leading to a catastrophic over-expansion or detonation of the structure and possible rupture of nearby structures, e.g., due to thermal loading.\nThe magnitude of oxygen enhancement due to a flame has been modeled by many researchers as being proportional to:\n                    ln        ⁢                                   ⁢                              (                                          P                ⁢                                                                   ⁢                                  O                  2                                            -                              m                ⁢                                                                   ⁢                P                ⁢                                                                   ⁢                C                                              )                2              ⁢                              (                                  k                  ⁡                                      (                                          x                      2                      ", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "Paul Verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'Basic Instinct' is back in a sequel\n\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of one of the most influential films of the 1980s, Brian De Palma’s seminal erotic thriller, Scorsese produced “Dressed to Kill”.\n\nWhile the late Paul Verhoeven’s “Basic Instinct” may very well be his most widely-known film, it’s also the one whose absence from a list of Verhoeven’s films seems more noticeable than in the wake of “Casino”.\n\nYet in a sense, “Basic Instinct” is where Verhoeven made his name in America. Despite its failure at the box office, “Basic Instinct” turned a huge number of people onto Verhoeven and his distinct brand of visual style, before going on to become a worldwide bestseller, receiving a well-deserved round of Oscar nominations as well as winning two BAFTAs and a Golden Globe.\n\nFollowing that win, of course, the franchise got its own sequel – but that did not go to plan, as the “Basic Instinct 2” screenplay, written by David E. Kelley (“Chicago Hope”, “Designing Women”), was shelved, and no script was ever produced.\n\n“I think the idea of a sequel is interesting,” Verhoeven told me as we sat down to watch the film last month. “I don’t regret not making this film because the original idea was good. So why don’t I make it on my own?”\n\n“If I could do what I want to do, I wouldn’t have any fears now,” he continues. “The idea was very original, the original concept – and the story is a nice story. It was very suspenseful. You didn’t see what’s gonna happen.”\n\nIt’s safe to say that Verhoeven’s original idea was a lot more provocative than what Kelley was writing. “If this idea is gonna happen, they have to get rid of the whole courtroom and make the whole trial out of a disco,” Verhoeven explains. “They have to have some crazy disco. You would know immediately this story’s going to be an erotic thriller. You can’t be in a modern courtroom and have sex in here. That would be silly!”\n\n“Somebody had asked me a long time ago, who do you think could write a screenplay like the original ‘Basic Instinct'? That’s really a difficult question, I’d say you can only come from an area that you like a lot. Because it’s just so imaginative… You gotta be imaginative. So if I didn’t come from a similar kind of style and world, I’d not really come up with a story so unique.”\n\nBut was it that style that held him back? “One day I might have a story that would be in my way of making a new movie, and then I would really not know what to do. I would just give up.

But it’s really a good way to test yourself, also you can do it on a very low budget, and I think you can find one on YouTube. It’s not very long. You can make it yourself.”\n\nSo how is the movie?\n\n“It’s a good movie!” Verhoeven says. “Good looking movie, even though it’s very dark.” He’s clearly no fan the film, as the opening is a reworking of the original film, with Al Pacino as an FBI profiler looking into a series of murders that take place around America.\n\nWhile “Basic Instinct” sees the “persona” of the character that Sharon Stone’s detective KITT becomes, “Dressed to Kill”, though, focuses on the real Sharon Stone, as another cop, played by David Keith, a friend of her character’s in “Basic Instinct”, finds himself in the same predicament.\n\n“To me, ‘Dressed to Kill’ is one of the best sequel movies.

{"text": "This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Uggams. The story was written by the wonderful Edith Head. They were filming an episode of the television show \"Bachelor Party\". To this day it is one of my all time favorite shows. The script and the direction is all over the place, but we are having a lot of fun.\n\nWe have a \"Bachelor Party\" going on in our house right now....so we are up at 8:00 am and have to make breakfast and get ready for work. Then we come home; relax and have a long lunch; go to work; and have dinner. The day is done by 5:00 pm where we are playing Monopoly with a girlfriend. Then, bedtime. And the next day we do it all over again. It's very hard on the poor children when all of a sudden mom and dad are back from work and we have to move furniture around and make a new life. This morning, we got ready for work and have been shooting all day. It's a new day. Another day of doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nThis is not a story about a house or a new life. It's about a group of women trying to make a new life and get out of their old life. I am a person who wants to try new things and I have never been one to go over the top on anything. But I have had enough of the same old same old way of doing things. We all have to look forward to making new things, getting out of old ways, and creating a better life.\n\nI am not complaining or anything but the kids have not had any sleep. They've had nothing until 5:00am and they've been up since 5:00 am. It's not complaining. It's reality. We're tired because the reality is that we have to make lunch; go to work; come home and make dinner, take shower, go to bed, then do it all over again. It gets very tiring. When something change we cannot be unhappy.\n\nWe are planning something for the kids and something for us. We're working so we can make the most of this beautiful day. I'm so happy it's a beautiful day. I may not like everything that comes back but I will work hard at it. We have to work hard or we will not do anything at all. We have to keep going and moving and growing. All the time. We're making this change. A new thing, a new way of being. We cannot go back and be the old us no more. We cannot revert back to the old way of doing things.\n\nYes, life has been very tiring and we need to rest. The day has been very full. The kids have been doing more than their share of working. They've had no rest. I really wanted to spend some time with them. I thought I would get something done around the house but my house looks worse than a junkyard.\n\nWe do need to slow down on our living standards just for one day. It is not realistic for us to expect to be living in five star hotel, with four maids, and with the best, most beautiful foods.\n\nThis is my dream and we're going to take all of the time we have and be thankful for it. At the same time we're trying to grow and make something new. Our living situation. Everything we do to make a better life for our kids.\n\nLife is not fair. We can't have a day off. Or a week off. We have to work very hard to get to this place. We have to work very hard to make this happen.\n\nWe have plans and goals for ourselves. We are going to set up what our goals are for that day.\n\nWe are going to take a day off. At this point in time, a day off is a luxury and we can say we are going to take a day off.\n\nIt's all too confusing. We have a lot of people trying to get there for many reasons but it's all over the place. We have people who want to do it with us, people who think that they are doing it for us, and those who just want to be there. What's this about a party anyway? I wish that it was a way for one of us to call it quits or to say, okay people, this isn't working. We can do something else.\n\nI understand everyone wanting to get away. To do what you want do.\n\nSome people can't afford to do it. You know, they have to pay the rent and they have to pay their car payment. They just have to figure out how to make their cars run so they can keep their jobs and do what they need to do.\n\nHow can I complain about that?\n\nIt's not easy. It may", "label": "gptj"}

PMID:18643055\n\nFull Text Available Microarray based classification methods are among the most commonly used machine learning techniques for the diagnosis of cancer and classification of disease states. Typically, the microarrays used in these studies are designed and fabricated specifically for the given disease of interest. However, this approach is costly and time consuming. In our study, we have used a technique called unsupervised learning to identify genes that are differentially expressed in various cancer types. These genes could be used for cancer classification and they can contribute in the classification of various disease states apart from cancer. This approach would be useful in cases where information for specific disease types is limited and microarrays or proteomics data are not available.\n\nThe present study has been planned in order to develop in-silico microarray (iMS) based methods for prediction and in-situ (iMS) evaluation using the GeneChip oligonucleotide array representing microarrays to obtain the expression profiling data obtained from human and canine prostate and testicular tissues from the perspective of genetic research. For the purpose of these studies, we have screened out genes with differentially expressed level in prostate and testicular tissues in human and canine using the iMS-based approach and validated this in-silico data via immunohistochemical evaluation of the expression status of the selected genes. We screened out the gene set with the expression level significantly different in the cell nuclei than in the cytoplasm in the canine tissue. All selected genes were overexpressed in prostate and testicular tissues in humans and dogs. However, seven of these genes were undetectable or hardly detectable in the testicular tissues of humans, whereas in-silico evaluation in this study has shown the downregulation of these genes in testicular tissues in comparison with prostate tissues. We could see a similarity in the microarray patterns with the immunohistochemical data except for the downregulation of PDE7A and ARL6IP1 genes in the nuclei of canine testicular tissues. The downregulated expression of these genes could suggest the negative influence on spermatogenesis in this species.\n\nThe present study has been planned in order to develop in-silico microarray (iMS) based methods for prediction and in-situ (iMS) evaluation using the GeneChip oligonucleotide array representing microarray to obtain the expression profiling data obtained from human and canine prostate and testicular tissues from the perspective of genetic research.

{"text": "The film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of the entire series.\n\nFirst released during a time of rampant film inflation, it has a lot of the signature elements of the genre - the opening action scenes, the heroine's relationship with the villain, the exotic locale, even the soundtrack, courtesy of Maurice Jarre's classic scores, seems as authentic as you can reasonably hope to get. The result is a film with a lot of style, but also of a certain charm.\n\nI will probably never get a chance to see it on the big screen, but if you had told me this was John Gielgud's final film, I think I would have done just as well as one of his previous four starring roles in The Tenth Man, The Ladykillers and Anastasia are just fantastic.\n\nThe two are often seen together in the same frame.\n\nAs for the book, that is where the real fascination for me lies. In the prologue, written by the author, there are some revealing insights into the making of the film:\n\n\"It was not only my good fortune to have the great actor Sir John Gielgud, who starred in the film, as my mentor in the theatre. For a second time I had the privilege of directing him. I can well remember the day it happened. We were on the stage of the London Palladium and I had asked him a direct question about the choice of an actress to play opposite him in his new film called \"The Love Song.\" His answer could have been written and spoken by the finest, most refined of actors, but Sir John and even then the man was only a working actress. \"What's all this about,\" - he asked. \"Why are you making such a fuss?\" \"No fuss, no fuss,\" I said, \"I am not making a fuss, but -\" he put his glass of milk down, leant forward and with those blue eyes of his looked straight into my eyes \"I ask you - what is an actress?\" I looked at his face without any change. He was smiling, looking straight into my eyes. \"An actress is a woman whose talent and personality are not fully disclosed - who must pretend and conceal. She is a person whose personality must never be fully revealed. \"To get such an actress is not quite as easy as picking up a flower. It is rather like having the sun in a greenhouse.\" \"An actress!\" he laughed, \"And do you know why I became an actor?\" - and then he told me the simple story of his life - how he had been a young English soldier in France, had been terribly wounded and in a fever dream, saw his own father - Sir Wilfred Kendal - who died when he was three, standing in a far-off country, laughing and crying at the same time. And then he had looked up and there was the sun, still shining brightly and was filled with that desire to be a son again and his father's laughter filled his heart and he became an actor. \"And that is what I want,\" I said. He answered after a moment's silence and a little look of regret. \"I should like to go with you,\" he said. But it was impossible. In fact the last months of his life were his happiest and he had too strong a spirit of the theatre, which he had nurtured since a boy, to ever leave any profession, even a good profession like his. That is why he asked me and I can say without any offence - if he asked me the question again now, I would probably reply no differently. \"So you see,\" he said simply, \"I would never have had to answer.\" \"But you are the greatest,\" I shouted at him, \"the most famous actor of all time and more important - this man, Sir Basil Zaharoff, your producer, says you'll play this man.\" \"Yes,\" he said simply, taking a piece of cake, \"I think perhaps he will.\"\n\nAnd I have to admit that he is a far better story-teller than his character in the film, a man with a dry sense of humour on his face, but a heart that must have broken a thousand times. The film does not make that clear at all. All we know is that the film is the story of Zaharoff being pursued by the German Secret Police and of his last desperate attempt to sell the English weapon that he has been working on.\n\n\"Why do you want to do this, Zaharoff?\" The secret agent asks him. The answer is not very clear at first, \"because I am in debt beyond recovery,\" he says, but slowly reveals more and more as the film unfolds. We learn about the birth of his son, who was to become an engineer - about his family in Russia where he was educated. We learn about the death of his wife whom he has loved since childhood. But why Zaharoff has become a German patriot", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "On Sunday, President Barack Obama traveled to Afghanistan to do what he's not always shown the courage to do during his presidency: address the nation of Americans and Americans abroad.\n\nSince he came to office in 2009, Obama has addressed a number of large audiences around the world about America and American values—including a \"fireside chat\" before a joint session of Congress, and a speech to the United Nations.\n\nHis speech to the Afghan government Tuesday should have been big enough to match them. Yet while he was delivering it, more than 1,000 Americans were dead in the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.\n\nAnd Obama got his opportunity. He talked—or tried to talk, and failed.\n\nObama promised the U.S. and the rest of the world an end to the war (we had seen enough of the bloody results) and he gave some hints that he might be willing to leave a residual force behind in Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent new attacks.\n\nBut most of his speech was about the wars he inherited from President George W. Bush in Afghanistan and Iraq. He even noted that, having \"left behind\" a lot of American troops, the new strategy in Afghanistan—that the U.S. would focus on Al Qaeda—had turned out not to be enough.\n\nWe had to change, Obama said, going on to describe the end to the American military's \"temporary surge\" in Afghanistan and the beginning of a new strategy.\n\nThe Afghan government (with U.S. help), he explained, now controls 60 percent of the country. The international community and the U.S. are training and assisting the new police and the Afghan forces (all the people and resources the Afghan government asks for, including American personnel).\n\nWhat else?\n\n\"We also learned some hard lessons,\" Obama said. \"Most of all, we learned that the Taliban were never going to reconcile with the Afghan government, and that Al Qaeda would never give up its sanctuary in Pakistan.\"\n\nA \"dispute over the legal status of landmines\" kept the two countries from signing a long-term security agreement, Obama said. And there were problems with corruption and governance within the Afghan government.\n\nObama noted that the war has \"cost the lives of more than 2,300 American soldiers and hundreds of American contractors. We have spent $110 billion.\"\n\nAnd, he's willing to admit, a lot of it wasted.\n\nIf you were to ask who won the war, Obama would likely say it was the Taliban and Al Qaeda.\n\n\"I want to repeat again what we tried to prove in these last nine months,\" Obama said. \"The coalition that's fighting against Al Qaeda is succeeding. The Taliban are losing ground.\"\n\nAs for the future, Obama acknowledged that it would be a struggle.\n\nIn Afghanistan, he said, \"We can't just turn the clock back. But with NATO's assistance and partnership, Afghans can now take their own country back.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the Afghan constitution is now about to go into effect.\n\n\"They now will be able to form their own government,\" he said. \"And our partnership in Afghanistan will be based on a set of shared values, the deepest aspirations of the Afghan people—and a strong, enduring partnership between our nations.\"\n\nHe said he'd never expected to be able to leave Afghanistan with \"hard-earned\" victory like this one, \"but it is an achievement worth celebrating.\"\n\nHe also talked about Iraq again.\n\nObama said he didn't rule out staying in Iraq past the end of this year—if Iraqis can't make their own country work.\n\nBut he was willing to let Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki figure it out alone.\n\nAnd al-Maliki should know it: If he continues to try to oppress Sunnis, Obama said, there will be consequences. Obama promised that the U.S. would not \"leave Iraqis to repeat those mistakes.\"\n\nHe then took the opportunity—and responsibility—to say two more very big things:\n\n\"The people of Iraq have always been at their best when they have chosen their own destiny. And they will show the resolve at a later date to do what they believe is best for them. And they will make their voices heard.\" (Yes, Obama's doing that, too.)\n\n\"Let me be clear,\" Obama said. \"Our commitment to support a sovereign, democratic, and unified Iraq remains ironclad.\" (Good to see that one again.)\n\nObama ended his speech by saying: \"I'm also hopeful that the new security agreement that we have signed with the Afghans will make it much easier for us to leave a residual force in Afghanistan. So that we can go after Al Qaeda with far fewer American troops—and leave a small, but robust, force behind to help them", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "In the 1960s, a series of discoveries, the most important of which was the isolation of the first naturally-occurring opiate, morphine, in poppies by the English plant physiologist and surgeon, Sir Henry S. Dale, provided an opportunity for the synthesis of further synthetic opiates. Over the ensuing two decades, hundreds of opioids and closely-related synthetic compounds have been isolated, sequentially tested and synthesized, the active ingredients in many being selective and in others not selective for their particular opioid receptor subtype (Kohji M. et al. 1990. Neuropharm., 20, 157-62; for recent reviews, see Martin K. J. et al. Neurosci, 1995, 95, 1-30; Martin K. J. and Williams P. J. Drugs of the Future, 2000, 25, 717-720). While the use of some non-selective opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine, has been valuable in medicine, the development of opioid receptor subtype-selective compounds, such as opioid analgesics, for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, has attracted great interest. In animal models, subtype-selective compounds have been shown to be more effective than non-selective opiates in relieving pain (Farr C. A. et al. 1994. Eur. J. Pharmacol., 261, 607-9; Shire M. J. et al. 1991, Br. J. Anaesth., 67, 10-8, and Farr C. A. et al. Drugs of the Future, 17, 1195-202).\nThree major classes of opioid receptor have been defined pharmacologically (Namen J. A. 1993. Pharmacol. Rev., 45, 3-24). The main division is between μ-, δ-, and κ-type receptors, the opioids agonising each of these subpopulations differentially. There is some evidence to suggest that all three types belong to the family of G protein coupled receptors (GCPRs). In this classification of opioid receptor subtypes, a ‘−’ sign denotes that the opioid has the highest affinity for that particular subtype, while a ‘+’ sign denotes that it has appreciable affinity for that subtype. It should thus be noted that a number of partial agonists are known that may bind either to one particular opioid receptor subtype, or to more than one.\nμ Opioid receptor (MOR)\nMOR agonists have analgesic properties and, depending on the particular opioid used, have varying intrinsic activities. While all analgesic opioids are MOR antagonists (naloxone) they also show a characteristic dose-sparing opioid antagonist effect (MOU effect) (Ziviec S. et al. 1988, Pain, 32:265-81), which indicates that some agonists can reduce the analgesic dose of co-administered opioid agonists. This characteristic is thought to arise from their ability to compete with other agonists of the receptor for binding to the receptor, thus decreasing the proportion of opioid receptors occupied by endogenous or exogenous ligand (Ziviec, S. et al. 1988, supra). The ‘MOU Effect’ is thought to be caused by a receptor interaction with the endogenous opioid peptide, endomorphin as disclosed in Ziviec et al. Nature, 1990, 345:719-21. MOR agonists may also cause respiratory depression, which limits their clinical use, however, the risk of clinically relevant respiratory depression, is small with these compounds when given in a dose that selectively occupies MOR with little or no action at κ opioid receptor (MOU/RESP), (Walsh, P. R. 1991, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 209, 283-7). MOR agonists also tend to have high affinity at κ opioid receptors and, along with endogenous opioids, may interact at this site to modulate breathing and other functions.\nδ Opioid receptor (DOR)\nOpioid agonists that display selectivity for this subtype are both well known in the prior art. For example ‘stag’ or ‘stigma’ toxins, which were isolated from the venoms of the saw-scaled viper (Trimeresurus scutatus) and the aculeatus snakes (Acinantophorus spp.) (Bertrand, R. et al. 1978, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 89, 654-60) are selective DOR agonists, which have been considered as useful analgesic agents. δ opioid (DOR) agonists also have many activities. Although DOR agonists do not generally produce respiratory depression (MOU/RESP), as μ receptor agonists do (Ziviec, S. et al., supra), they can cause emesis (DOR/EMET", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "over the course of its motion through the galaxy, and it loses orbital energy as it\ndrags along the magnetic field lines in a process called “gyrating.” The\ngyration is a way that matter can lose energy, and it allows stars with sufficient\nmagnetic fields to maintain a fairly stable mass within the galaxies.\n\nSo, from this scenario, we would expect the\nstrength of the magnetic fields around our Sun to be about a thousand times\ngreater than it is actually observed to be, right?\n\nYes, you\ncould be forgiven for thinking that, since in this scenario the magnetic field\nis what is powering the star. But there is something else: the\ndynamo theory also predicts that you should see the same magnetic field\npatterns everywhere we look, even if it is only at the largest scales. That\nmeans that the magnetic patterns, which are generated by the dynamo cycle,\nshould have a length-scale that’s very similar to the length of the solar\nsystem: about 10,000 light-years, if the Sun is the middle of this\ngalactic system.\n\nIn this sense, you could think of the solar\nsystem as being right in the middle of a giant spiral, much like the spiral\nof a galactic disk. And if some stars within that spiral are being powered\nby dynamo processes, then we should see the same strength of magnetic fields\neverywhere.\n\nAnd that is exactly what is observed in the\ngalaxies. What is more, the magnetic fields all over the\ngalaxy seem to have a strength about a thousand times that of the Sun’s. This\nis strong evidence for the existence of dynamo processes and their effect on\nstars.\n\nThis also tells us that the dynamo processes\nare very efficient at generating these magnetic fields, since the field\npatterns are so uniform. It may be that their very regularity is the reason why\nwe don’t see much sign of turbulence in our solar neighborhood, despite\nthe fact that turbulence can disrupt dynamo action. We will investigate this\nfurther in a future article.\n\nBut we have one more piece of important information\nwhich only becomes apparent if we understand the Sun’s magnetic field far\nbetter than we currently do. We know that the Sun’s strong magnetic field\narises from dynamo processes that have been working for a long time. The\nSun’s magnetic field is a mixture of two different magnetic geometries: a\nprimordial field generated as the Sun was forming, and a much smaller-scale\nfield generated by a cycle of magnetic reconnection. At least a few solar\ncycles ago, the latter magnetic field was generated by a huge loop of\nmagnetic field, called the helmet streamer, which stretched over\nthe Sun’s entire surface. A huge number of tiny “micro-instabilities”\nwithin that loop sparked off small reconnections which produced a great deal of\nenergy each time they occurred. And this was enough to power the Sun with\nenough luminosity to create a solar wind, which in turn provided the\nenergised particles required to drive the heliospheric dynamo: the solar wind\npowered the Sun’s magnetic field.\n\nA recent paper by Chatterjee&Lai (2016) has now analysed magnetic fields in the Sun from the inside\nout, using helioseismology to infer the details of the Sun’s convective\nplumes. They find that the Sun’s magnetic field is “patchy”. When they look at magnetic fields in sunspots, they find something else:\nthey find sunspot magnetic fields to be quite strongly toroidal fields. That\nis, the sunspots are associated with strong concentrations of twisted field\nlines called “torsions”.\n\nAnd this means we should start to consider the Sun in\nthe context of a dynamo, because, as\npreviously stated, a dynamo is a machine that converts energy into energy.\nAnd the Sun converts huge amounts of solar energy into energy in the form of\nheliospheric winds and the magnetic field. This process is the source of the\nenergy necessary to power the Sun’s dynamo and the magnetism in the stars that\nwe see around us. But to make the magnetic fields of stars, the Sun’s dynamo\nmust work efficiently.\n\nThe Sun has now had over a billion years to adapt its magnetic field\nto the evolution of its convective pattern, and it is only the most recent\ngeneration of dynamo activity that is now generating significant magnetic\nfields. So we see that the Sun is generating magnetic fields from its own\nactivity for the first time. And it’s generating them quite strongly, since as\n", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "Residents of the south-western village of Garmen marched in the streets on Saturday to protest against the arrest of a prominent lawyer.\n\nPolice raided the villagewhile carrying out search warrants as part of a fraud investigation against prominent businesswoman and lawyer Irena Gavriljuc who was among 30 people arrested last week, according to local media reports.\n\n“Everyone is outraged and can’t believe that you can arrest everyone and not even tell us why,” said resident Petar Tvrdic, according to the daily Vecernji List.\n\n“They have destroyed our happiness. Everyone in the village has had a broken heart,” he said.\n\nPolice seized computers from inside the house, according to reports. The investigation was launched after an anonymous complaint was made to the Anti-corruption Agency.\n\nThe mayor of the village, Sladomir Kneznjic, told Vecernji List that the raid was a breach of the presumption of innocence.\n\nGavriljuc is the head of the ZAG legal consultancy group and was arrested along with 29 other people on March 15. She is also a lawyer who has provided specialist advise to a number of government institutions and high-level politicians, including two high-ranking military officials who were both investigated and cleared in the past.\n\nGavriljuce was released on bail last week after 10 days in custody after she was questioned by Antitrust police for alleged fraud and extortion linked to the alleged purchase of a BMW M5.\n\nThe arrest comes one day after the Supreme Court convicted three Bulgarian businessmen of extorting millions of dollars in return for help in the investigation of their alleged fraud involving the purchase of a luxury apartment in London. Although the ruling appeared to signal the end of a four-year investigation by a special unit of the Bulgarian prosecutors, police raids around Bulgaria had been expected for several weeks.\n\nAmong the people arrested are the head of a state-run construction company, a former employee of Bulgaria’s foreign ministry and the Bulgarian ambassador to Israel.\n\nA total of 13 individuals were convicted in the Supreme Court of fraud and illegally obtaining documents.\n\nAlthough the investigation was led from the anti-corruption agency, there have been widespread claims that the probe was instigated in retaliation for a government investigation launched in 2009 against Bulgarian politicians and businessmen linked to Bulgaria’s largest bank, BNP Paribas SA.\n\nBoris Petokov, the director of the anti-corruption agency, in 2011 launched an investigation into BNP Paribas’ alleged links to money laundering and tax evasion.\n\nA number of Bulgarian MPs were arrested as a result of the probe but the investigation was later halted after three major bank clients withdrew the government’s request for an extension of the probe. The arrest of Gavriljuce appears to have been triggered by the government’s decision to extend the probe.\n\nA series of raids on banks, politicians’ offices and apartment blocks across Bulgaria on March 15 was the culmination of a major investigation into financial fraud, allegedly linked to a real estate deal in London, as well as to bribes paid by the bank of Bulgaria’s second-largest lender to finance its purchases of a series of luxury apartment in British cities.\n\nThe investigation was led by the National Anticorruption Bureau (NAB) for the first time, following an anonymous complaint about “a suspicious transfer of sums [of money] through UK and Bulgarian banks” in 2009 linked to the purchase of apartments in London.\n\nThe Bulgarian press reported last week that the investigation identified three suspects, and that the NAB has since found documents in the apartment of a former military colonel linked to BNP Paribas.\n\nA number of politicians, including the head of the bank in question, have been placed under arrest.\n\nOther allegations concerning a luxury apartment deal in London have also been levelled at the BNP Paribas as well as major regional banks, which have themselves been scrutinised.\n\nFollowing the arrest of the three suspects, the Bulgarian press and opposition figures said the investigation’s first phase, which aimed to identify the individuals behind the deals, appears to have succeeded.\n\nBut the investigation has been plagued by allegations of political interference.\n\nAccording to Bulgarian media reports, the first phase of the probe was delayed after the government decided to extend its scope. A number of opposition figures have alleged that Prime Minister Boyko Borissov’s centre right, Ataka, has engaged in extortion and attempted to extort officials in the Anti-Corruption Agency, and the government has also distanced itself from these allegations.\n\nAt the same time, President Rumen Radev has been facing an accusation of a conflict of interest in an investigation into large-scale smuggling through the port of Varna.

{"text": "realizability for knowledge representation formalisms studies the following question : *How can we formulate a mathematical knowledge model that supports the specification of reasoning rules (in terms of *truth conditions) which correspond to a set of well defined situations and can be used to deduce knowledge from?* This question can be reformulated using *knowledge representation formalisms* : *How can we represent knowledge using a knowledge representation formalism?* A knowledge representation formalism in its core is essentially a *semantic model for* of knowledge in the sense of the semantic paradox of Tarski.\n\nConceptual and Logical Aspects\n==============================\n\nThe Semantic View of Knowledge\n------------------------------\n\nWhen we know a sentence in natural language we can always tell more about *how* something is true and to what extent we know something. However, these facts only inform us about the *consequence* of accepting the sentence, which in turn also depends on *the context in which* we have accepted the sentence. What does not happen is to see and relate it to a *semantic* state of affairs of the speaker and hearer at a given instant of time. On the contrary, a *content* or *world view* of a sentence tells us what a speaker is actually thinking about when she accepts, or does not accept, the sentence in question, or that is, *its semantic nature*.\\\nAs we learn to know more about an object we make progress in *understanding that object*; the word *understanding* denotes the ability to relate and comprehend a state of affairs of an object or event (for a definition of *understanding* see [@Swin48]). Understanding is *not* a matter of logic alone; it is also a matter of *context*. We understand not only because we have the right logic to make a statement true, but also because we know, in a more or less detailed way, how the object or event is true. In sum: *We understand something because we know the semantic context* that makes that something or that which seems to be a thing true. Knowing a semantic context means knowing the state of affairs that are the consequences of the logical truth of a statement and understanding a sentence means knowing the semantic consequences of accepting the sentence in question. Knowing a semantic context is, among other things, knowing *how* things are (in the sense of Aristotle) since knowing something is a matter of seeing how it is. It is important to notice that knowing is not a trivial matter but rather it requires us to build up our knowledge of the semantics (or semantics) of our world.\\\nThis simple but important remark has to be taken into account when studying the knowledge of natural languages. Indeed, we humans know what there really is and what seems to be true, as long as a semantic context is known to us. Hence, we have *semantic access* to the world, that is to say, it is our business to know the world *semantically*.\\\nWe make progress in this *semantic view on things* or *world view*, which consists of *knowing* that there *are* such and such objects, that such and such events happen, etc. We never gain *ontological knowledge* because nothing *is*; what we *know* is always in the context of the world in which we *know* it; there is no “reality\" in a certain sense. The world is only what is “there\", or in context, within the limits of what is “there\".\\\nHow can we learn to build up a world view and to construct the models of knowledge we need for a correct understanding of our universe and for a semantic view of things? When we do not “know\", our model of the world is limited. Knowledge also leads us to develop a model of knowledge. By *model of knowledge* one can understand a *hypothetical model of a system that one has decided to investigate and to understand on the basis of the observations of a certain situation*.\\\nIn a model, one assumes that there is a given state of things (*context*) and then one determines the implications that one can establish from the given state of things (from our knowledge of them), that is, which implications follow from our knowledge of things in a logically sound way (*implications of the logical truth of our knowledge* ). The result of our investigations are the implications that we consider logical but we also ask the questions of whether they are in accord with our knowledge of things; we *test* these implications for truth. Our task is to find out whether these implications, if true, imply as yet something that is not in harmony with our knowledge of things. Thus, the *logical structure* of a model gives us a means to *test hypotheses* and to *test beliefs on a logical level*. In sum, a model of the world gives us a means to *test hypotheses", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "The Fringe act Dolls, who work with the Cirk La Rose Theatre, have been busy at work with their performance of Mary Barton. Dolls (Melissa Smith, Emily Widdows and Zoe Stapleford) have recently been confirmed as performing at the Cirk La Rose during the 2017 Fringe season.\n\nThe three-person cabaret will explore the true story of Mary Barton, an 18th-century factory-girl turned philanthropist during a performance of Richard Llewellyn’s play.\n\nOn the surface, the story follows Mary Barton’s unlikely rise to wealth and popularity when she anonymously gives away her £500 to the poor, but the show actually explores how she became the wealthy person she is today.\n\nEmily Widdows, a graduate of the National Youth Theatre, said: “We’ve been working tirelessly to perfect this show and are really excited to tell Mary’s story to the Cirk La Rose audience in 2017. We’re proud that this is the second show we have performed this year. We’re proud to show it to Edinburgh audiences at such a vital time for us.”\n\nThe story is adapted to the cabaret format to be performed for two shows per day, and will be accompanied by a bar and a cast of amateur actors.\n\nThe performance will show the audience a picture of who Mary Barton truly was as they discover her life, and the true story behind the name, which comes from a legend that Mary was cursed to live for 100 years in this shape (with her head always looking into the distance).\n\nThe three performers will explore the history and legends behind a character they will perform alongside for the rest of their careers. Melissa Smith said: “We’ve been working together for nearly three months. We’ve been really excited about the story and the opportunity to perform it alongside our long-time collaborators.\n\n“It’s a privilege to tell her story, and it’s a privilege to be at the fringe festival showing her story.”\n\nWe are delighted to announce that Mary’s Barton – Cirk La Rose Theatre will be at the Cirk La Rose Theatre during the Edinburgh Fringe 2016 season.\n\nThis story is told by an 18th-century factory-girl who becomes a philanthropist and the Cirk La Rose Theatre is excited to be working with Dolls to tell the story of Mary Barton’s story, with two shows on Wednesday 25 September at 7.30pm and Wednesday 1 August at 9.30pm.\n\nIt’s a real privilege to work in partnership with such a prestigious and historic theatre, and we hope that our partnership will create opportunities for exciting collaborations.\n\nWith two performances a day, Dolls will tell Mary’s story throughout the festival including at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, on Sunday 10 June, at 7.30pm and on Tuesday 13 July, at 8.30pm.\n\nThe story of Mary Barton is fascinating as it follows the rise of a factory-child to become a wealthy philanthropist.\n\nThe Fringe review: For me there were a few stand-outs at the Cirk La Rose Theatre. But it is Mary Barton @ Cirk La Rose Theatre’s performance of Dolls that I will remember most.\n\nThe Cirk La Rose – Mary Barton @ Cirk La Rose Theatre\n\nMelissa Smith, Dolls – Zoe Stapleford, Dolls\n\nEmily Widdows, Dolls\n\nZoe Stapleford and Melissa Smith\n\nMary’s Barton – Dolls\n\nMelissa Smith and Zoe Stapleford\n\nCirk La Rose Theatre – Mary Barton @ Cirk La Rose Theatre – Edinburgh Fringe 2016\n\nCirk La Rose Theatre is delighted to present Mary’s Barton @ Cirk La Rose Theatre – a production by Dolls presented by Melissa Smith, Zoe Stapleford, Emily Widdows.\n\nDirected by Anna-Louise Jupp, the show will be performed at the Cirk La Rose Theatre, 5 South Bridge, from Friday 25 September 2016.\n\nCirk La Rose Theatre is Edinburgh’s favourite destination theatre within easy walking distance of the historic Scottish Parliament, New Town and Bruntsfield Links Golf Course.\n\nThe Cirk La Rose Theatre hosts more than 600 live shows a year, including everything from touring productions, original Scottish works to well-known and exciting touring shows by internationally recognised theatre companies such as: Aladdin, Les Miserables, Starry St. Mary’s, Jersey Boys, Macbeth, War Horse, The Little Shop Of Horrors, Beautiful People, Chicago The Musical and Fiddler On The Roof.\n\nMary’s Barton will be their first appearance at the Cirk La Rose Theatre.\n\nTo mark their second appearance, the Cirk La", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "Yelp ratings for such restaurants can increase sell-out evenings by nearly 20% on average, and increase revenues per evening by more than two-thirds. Yelp is not just for diners and reviewers, and its potential for non-food related businesses is clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nFranchisees can be successful by creating or sourcing a product that others are happy to pay money for. The biggest mistakes franchisees make are underestimating the effort required and over-happily assuming that they know everything a potential franchisee should. This might be as simple as sourcing the best ingredients or it could be running a successful operations or marketing department.\n\nAn operation/service franchise can be used as a proven business model to solve and monetize a problem. The business model is based on the fact that people pay money for services and/or products that are being bought in their absence by someone they trust. The model has been proven for decades, as pizza chains, delivery services, and restaurants are the oldest examples. Today, we know that social proof can work as well as good old advertising.\n\nThe potential of businesses such as restaurants or cafes are very high. There are no real boundaries to what can be offered, as most of what we buy and use is not manufactured by someone else, but produced right there and then. As such, if an industry is worth $10 trillion dollars and has an annual growth rate of 3% each year, it will grow nearly 100x in size from today to 2030. Yet, there is still a lack of quality information available about how to make the leap from opening a business that is profitable today to a one where the first year is break-even and then becomes stable over time.\n\nOne of the great things about being a business is being able to take a problem and put some money to solving it. The franchise model offers the opportunity to offer a service or even a physical product that solves a problem and is trusted by consumers, without necessarily starting from scratch. This is especially relevant for start-ups who don't have time to wait for an established franchise to start offering the same product. Instead these start-ups can simply use a proven business model to offer the product as their own.\n\nToday, there is a massive demand for new restaurants, but an overabundance of unfulfilled supply. As a result, opening a new restaurant is challenging. There are only so many places where the restaurant and location are right for your business. The other obstacle is time. You need a combination of time and money to get yourself into a position where business is growing and your costs are stabilizing. This gives you a very small margin on which you can operate.\n\nThe biggest mistake that franchisees make is to underestimate the effort that leads up to this critical stage. This is where having a mentor or a mastermind can be invaluable. You will need someone to walk you through the process of starting your business. You might need someone to provide you all available information on the industry, the industry's challenges or opportunities, what is working and what is not (or how to optimize it), and so on. This is called mentorship and mastermind coaching.\n\nAnother mistake that franchisees make is to underestimate how much money and time it takes to run a good operations or marketing department. The cost of hiring a full-time marketing director or operations manager is a lot of money. Even then, a startup can have a decent marketing team or operations team for a little less than a year. Then, if they make a mistake that slows down growth, they are then forced to either cut people or increase margins to stay afloat. This can be a vicious circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, when I started my last startup, I hired a marketing director, who was hired almost five years ago. She was a full-time employee. A year ago, for the second year of her employment, I replaced her with a full-time employee in-house. This freed up a lot of money for me to put into other areas. This was an efficient use of money and time.\nWhat if the problem is something much simpler? Perhaps the key is an efficient solution for that business problem.\n\nHow can you do this on your own? In my opinion, there are many advantages to joining a franchise. Among all the disadvantages, one of the biggest is that it can be expensive and time-consuming.\n\nLet's start with the cost. I estimate that a new franchisee opening, say a coffee shop, costs around $80,000 to $100,000, including the real estate portion, the business license, the food safety certificate, inventory, inventory software, delivery service, marketing, operations, and so on. That's not even taking into account startup fees, which are usually high, of course.\n\nFranchisee\n\nCosts\n\nCoffee Shop\n\n$80,000 to $100,000\n\nReal Estate\n\n$20,000", "label": "gptj"}

On the sixth, seventh and eighth rows, the first six, seven and eight combs are found in regular intervals, respectively. On each row, the eight combs are closely aligned to the one next to them. The central combs of the eighth row are also on a high plane and their number, usually two (6), can be distinguished from above or below the animal, when examining it from above or below respectively (7). The median antennae reach well beyond the front edge of the animal (8). The eyes are on the front edge between the front-most pair of frontal tentacles.\n\nThe frontal tentacles are long, slender and covered with sensilla on the tips: short- or long-curved filiform, short- or long-barbed, or medium-bearing. Long and medium sensilla also occur on the margin of the two largest lateral tentacles. Medium sensilla (9, 10) have pointed tips bearing a short curved bar (9+). The diameter of a medium sensillum is similar to the diameter of the large lateral tentacle. As usual, large sensilla occur on the tips of lateral tentacles and they are short, filiform, barbed, of medium size, i.e. the length of the bar is equal to or greater than the diameter of the sensillum. On the abcaulus of the frontal tentacles, sensilla are long and filiform (11), but there is an additional row near the apex of the tentacle, with sensilla short and filiform (6), like those of the medial tentacles (12, 13).\n\nLateral tentacles are long, and covered with sensilla on the tips of the two rows of small pointed lobules that are present on their tentacles (14, 15). The second and larger row has a high plane, but the first one is on a lower plane, with tentacles of medium size. The distance between two small pointed lobules of the main row is twice that between two lobules of the second one.\n\nAbcaulus have sensilla on the tips (16), and the tips of the main body of lateral tentacles have short, barbed sensilla (17) and the tip of the small ones have a pointed structure similar to those of the main row on the lateral tentacula. On the margin of the two lateral tentacles, sensilla of short (9), medium (10) and long (18) types are present.\n\nMesosoma\n\nNo spinous plates are present and there is a strong muscular bulge on the ventral surface. The lateral edges of the mesosoma are also thickened.\n\nThe anterior edges of meso- and metasomal segments appear thickened. However, those of the second and third segments do not reach the base of the setae, which are rather wide and long. Dorsal setae are long, but not as long as those of the second and third pair. The length of the lateral ones is equal to that of the medial ones.\n\nMetasomal segment III has the coxa with the dorsal surface smooth, medially slightly convex and with six lateral teeth. Femora are long and slender, but not as long as those of the first pair. Length of the second pair is nearly equal to that of the first. Dorsum of metasomal segment III has a broad basal area, followed by a short, slightly wider portion. All trochanters and tibiae have medium-sized sensilla. Femora are very long for the length of metatarsus, and the latter is slightly longer than wide. Metatarsus are long and slender, bearing long setae covering all the trochantral area. Pores are very similar to those of the first pair.\n\nSkins\n\nAll skin areas bear very numerous seta. Dorsal skin of the trunk has small sensilla on all the points. Sensilla of the second and third pair of segmental edges are short. In addition, three pairs of long seta are found next to the two lateral ones (19). Those of the first pair bear a short, barbed shaft (20, 21). Setae on the surface of the third and fourth pairs are shorter and longer, respectively, than those of the first pair.\n\nPosterior skin is covered with large rounded setae and a few shorter ones. Setae of the first pair are short and barbed, of medium length. Those on the second pair are longer, but not as long as those of the first. Small sensilla are found near the tips of the long lateral setae of posterior-most segment. Some lateral setae (22, 23) are long and barbed, but others are filiform,", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "This is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the genre from a few decades back and still manages to raise the standard. This is in no way a remake of the original, as many people assume. While I don't remember what exactly the original plot was, it had a good story and it was a nice contrast to be a part of a modern-day suburb. You have your own town, and it has its own story, but the story of this film is different. The residents are much more active in their lives. The story also has a deeper sense of humor (which isn't a bad thing as far as I'm concerned.) I like being a part of a community, but I like doing things outside of that. With this, I was more than happy to sit in my front room and watch the events unfold in the middle of everything. The set pieces of the house are also a sight to behold. I really appreciate that everything looks so close to home, and I believe it's much easier for someone who is not used to this house to believe that it was all their own house. This film really puts people away when it comes to creating something that is terrifying and interesting.

And even the other part is really a subset of climate-change issues that the U.S. is very active in because the U.S. is a big contributor. The fact that we have the world's largest economy is a big part of what's driving the climate challenge.\n\nSo while it will be very focused on the economic part of it, part of it will be some focus on the other challenges, as well. And in addition to those challenges, there are — this will, again, lead to a discussion of the future. Because the biggest problem with climate change, as you know, is that it's not something that can be dealt with by a technology that's here right now. We have to deal with it over a 20- to 30-year period where if we deal with it right now, it could have very serious consequences. So we're going to focus on that as well. The other challenge we're faced with now — and there really are two aspects to the climate challenge, because the climate challenge is about two important topics: one is energy and the issue about how the world is getting energy, and the other about land. So it's energy first and then land.\n\nWe'll talk about these in order and then move on to the third program, which is the fourth program today. We'll look at what's going on in the U.K., since some of you may have seen the U.K. climate-change bill.

I was just meeting with a Chinese colleague last week, and — so that's our third program. The fourth one will be the development of the climate-change agenda for this meeting, and how do we move ahead from here. We'll talk about the future in terms of what can be done and how to go forward. So again, this is the most intense, I think, in terms of talking about these two big — these two big challenges of climate change. And it'll really be a good discussion.\n\nI mentioned, by the way, the World Economic Forum will have a very big event of its own. It takes place in the middle of the year. It's in the middle of January or the beginning of January. It's in Davos, Switzerland, and it runs from — as many of you know, it's a week long.\n\nSo all three of us at the World Economic Forum will be together from mid-January to the beginning of the year, and our topics will be related to these three topics in the first one we'll talk about, which is in Davos and it'll start on January 16th.\n\nSo I really look forward to being with you and sharing these with you during the entire four days, and we'll try to have — we'll do all four programs. Maybe some of you are coming, some of you aren't coming, so we'll try to have a discussion among the four of us about what needs to happen and how to do it. And then after that, we'll be having other activities, as well, and we continue to talk about this issue among the four of us and also the business community that's doing very well in terms of energy consumption and energy efficiency. The other three of us have had this conversation in the past, and we continue to talk about these issues in the future.", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "At the beginning of the 20th century, important advancement in biotechnology were made with the discovery of genetic principles during the work on bacteriophages. Biotechnology evolved from phage therapy to gene therapy to recombinant (r) protein technology^[@CR2],\\ [@CR3]^. Currently, proteins are important bioproducts but also have significant contributions to molecular diagnostics. In fact, with only a few examples^[@CR4]--[@CR6]^, applications of proteins in diagnostic technology have been developed and continue to be developed. In general, protein-based technology is superior to any other alternative method; however, it has major limitations. Proteins are generally produced by *in vitro* or by recombinant (r) DNA technologies in *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) cells. This bacterial host is also used to produce r-proteins, which are more soluble and easier to use than human-derived proteins^[@CR1],\\ [@CR2]^. Recombinant (r) protein production in *E. coli* cells is well-established, with some differences between *E. coli* and human cell lines^[@CR7]^. *E. coli* cells are prokaryotes, which have a smaller genome compared with both eukaryotes, such as mammalian cells, and a larger proteome than unicellular organisms^[@CR8]^. The expression of foreign proteins into living (proto)cells is, however, a challenging and challenging task for protein production.\n\nWhile *E. coli* cells may contain other species that share their genetic code, such as *Saccharomyces cereviciae* and *Saccharomyces bayanus*, most proteins can function in both *E. coli* and *S. cereviciae* cells. The reason for this is that codons in the two genomes have a high level of identity^[@CR1],\\ [@CR7]^. A similar situation exists for expression in mammalian cells, but mammalian codon usage is different from *E. coli* and *S. cereviciae* cell lines, and this can make translation inefficient in these cell lines^[@CR7],\\ [@CR9]^.\n\nA high rate of protein production and a high level of codon identity is important to reduce the size of the expression cassette. Many of these cells have a large genome^[@CR8]^, making the production process more challenging, especially for large amounts of protein product. The size of a standard protein is between 70 kDa and 1 MDa whereas bacteria may contain up to 10^8^ copies of a gene, and for mammalian cells there are only two orders of magnitude between proteins of different molecular weight^[@CR7],\\ [@CR9]^. For recombinant DNA technology to improve the production of proteins in *E. coli* cells, there is a need to develop improved systems for protein and nucleic acid expression. The two main approaches that are currently used to increase protein production in bacteria are protein engineering and host-vector systems.\n\nCurrent strategies in protein engineering use directed evolution for improved proteins^[@CR10]^. Directed evolution is the process by which a protein is evolved to have new or improved properties. This can be accomplished over the course of a few generations. The main advantage of such methods is that this can be accomplished without genetic modification of the cell (mutation). The current use of directed evolution in synthetic biology is to use DNA shuffling, which may involve recombination of multiple genes within a genome. This approach is based on the fact that genes with similar function might share similarity in their protein structures in the central pore; which makes them interchangeable^[@CR11]^. This can be achieved by combining the DNA sequences, even distantly-related coding sequences, into recombinants. Directed evolution (evolution *in vivo*) differs from standard Darwin's theory of natural selection for evolution, and is also different from classical recombination^[@CR12]^. This method in recombinant DNA is more than just shuffling fragments to increase expression in the cells^[@CR13]^. In fact, directed evolution is an important tool in functional genomics^[@CR14]^. Directed evolution (or mutagenesis) involves the amplification of genetic information, selection of the best genes, recombination followed by evolution of the selected genes, or a combination of the two methods^[@CR10]^.\n\nThe use of directed evolution in the selection, recombination and evolution of nucleic acid sequences followed by synthesis of recombinants is a promising method to be used for synthetic biology applications^[@CR10]^. For this purpose, a high level of codon similarity must be introduced into the nucleic acid sequences", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "uric acid ( ua ) is the end product of purine metabolism and is released to the blood stream from the cells lining the urinary tract. It is secreted mainly by proximal tubule cells of the proximal tubular epithelium. Ua excretion occurs mainly in the urine in response to metabolic and dietary stimuli.\n\nUa excretion is regulated by a tubular response known as the Fanconi syndrome. The tubular response is triggered by decreased activity in proximal tubular cells, which is associated with inhibition of ureagenesis as a result of a decrease in the rate of de novo synthesis of urea as a purine metabolite and reduced ammonia conversion into urea \\[[@b26-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. The tubular response results in decreased reabsorption of ua in the proximal tubule, leading to increased urinary excretions of ua. In a patient with a normal kidney function in the absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a decrease in de novo purine synthesis occurs as a result of decreased purine intake or a decrease in the activity of the purine enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) \\[[@b26-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1],[@b27-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. The purine catabolism leads to decreased urea synthesis by proximal tubular cells as a result of a low level of uric acid production, with an appropriate reabsorption of ua from the urine \\[[@b28-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\].\n\nIn humans, uric acid (ua) excretion exceeds its production, and the production of urea is increased in the uremic individual. The tubular response to CKD is considered to be an effective adaptive mechanism. However increased ua retention is responsible for tubular injury; it is responsible for acute and chronic renal injury \\[[@b27-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1],[@b29-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. The excretion of ua may increase up to 15 times the urinary creatinine excretion in CKD, and it is responsible for the accumulation of uric acid. The role of ua in promoting arterial inflammation is discussed below. The ua/creatinine ratio (UAC) may rise in cases of CKD to levels higher than 10, which constitutes the evidence. Although UAC may rise, a normal UAC usually indicates a normal kidney function \\[[@b30-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1],[@b31-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. Therefore, UAC is used as a screening test that can be used to identify renal impairment in asymptomatic patients or in patients with no symptoms.\n\nUA accumulation may be due to enhanced dietary purine intake resulting from inadequate purine restriction for protein intake or due to inadequate excretion of uric acid in patients with a normal creatinine clearance. Hyperuricosuria is generally due to a reduced renal excretion of uric acid. The excretion of uric acid is reduced by up to 70% in patients with chronic renal failure \\[[@b29-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. The renal excretion of uric acid is decreased by the absence or dysfunction of proximal tubule cells and by the inability of the kidney to metabolize uric acid under conditions of a reduced purinolytic flux into uric acid.\n\nHyperuricosuria may be asymptomatic or with symptoms of gout or urinary tract stones \\[[@b32-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\]. Hyperuricosuria in patients with CKD may be classified as primary or secondary. Primary hyperuricosuria, also known as familial juvenile gout, is a congenital or a genetic condition resulting mostly from the genetic abnormality of APRT and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, both of which have an important role in urea synthesis; they are both located in the proximal tubules \\[[@b27-medscimonit-18-5-bras-1]\\].

{"text": "the essential feature of weak measurements on quantum systems is that they are designed so that only a small fraction of the overall system undergoes a strong measurement, while the rest of the system is measured weakly. In a weak measurement of a system consisting of an observable $A$ and pointer observable $B$ (see Fig. \\[Fig1\\]), one applies a Hamiltonian to “stir-up” the pointer, leading to an increase of pointer momentum (for which it would typically correspond to a collapse of the pointer observable for the case of position or its conjugate momentum for the case of conjugate momentum measurements). The resulting disturbance in the system, however, is typically a small perturbation due to the weak Hamiltonian and is very small compared with the strong measurement-induced pointer shift. This kind of experiment is generally referred to as a *weak amplification*. Weak measurements can be viewed as the limit of strong measurements when one performs the latter on small subensembles of some initially prepared pointer-particle ensemble [@Aharonov], and they can be regarded as a special case of a more general kind of measurement [@Rosenfeld].\n\nTo quantify the disturbance it is usually expressed as the change of expectation values of the system observable $A$ relative to the case of a standard strong measurement of $A$, typically $\\Delta A = \\langle A \\rangle_{W} -\n\\langle A \\rangle_{S}$ (see also Fig. \\[Fig1\\]). Such a difference is typically small when the pointer-particle is initially prepared in the distribution that realizes $\\langle B\n\\rangle_{S}$ ($\\langle A \\rangle_{S} = \\langle B \\rangle_S$).

{"text": "we study the flux and the angular power spectrum of the [$B$-mode]{}  anisotropies produced by cosmic superstrings at the end of inflation as predicted in some specific models.'\n---\n\nIntroduction —\\[sec:Introduction\\]\n=================================\n\nA natural question to address is whether the effects of cosmic superstring networks may have been observed already in the sky. We make the assumption that superstrings did actually form during inflation and discuss such effects. A second question is whether these effects depend on the length of the string, but also on the network size, i.e. the number of intersections on a particular scale, and on the energy of the network. A third question relates to the energy fraction that is in the network, as well as the initial string configurations and the model for the network evolution. We will concentrate on the [$B$-mode]{}  [$\\text{C}_\\ell^B$]{} anisotropies, which are the dominant contribution to the CMB temperature anisotropies produced by cosmic strings at low angular scales.\\\nIn [@Ade:2013jga], Planck data are interpreted in favour of a lower bound on cosmic superstrings. Using an effective field theory approach to string networks, it is shown that a bound given by $G\\mu/\\alpha'$ of $10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ on $\\alpha'$ yields a limit on $G\\mu$.\\\nIn [@Tasinato:2014tea], authors use a numerical approach, calculating the total energy fraction of cosmic superstrings from a model for the network evolution. The energy fraction is parameterised by the fraction of the string tension $\\mu$ that ends up as cosmic strings when including quantum gravity, $G\\mu$, and a parameter $G\\mu/{N_M}$, where $N_M$ is the number of intersections at a given scale. They calculate the temperature anisotropies for the different initial network configurations, and find that for superstring-derived [$B$-mode]{}s, given the bounds on $\\mu$ and $G\\mu/\\alpha'$, the observed anisotropies can be produced by all the studied scenarios.\\\n\nInitial Conditions from the Energy Fraction of Cosmic Strings\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn what follows, we will give a brief summary of the three aspects, with emphasis on the model for the network evolution. For more details, see [@Hindmarsh:2011qk; @Hindmarsh:2012rc; @Hindmarsh:2012rcB] and [@Hindmarsh:2012rc; @Hindmarsh:2013pg] and references therein.\\\n\n### Initial network configurations \\[sec:IC\\]\n\nThe evolution of the string network on large scales, the evolution relevant for large $\\ell$ modes, is well understood, see e.g. [@Hindmarsh:1994re]. When the string network is formed during a phase transition in the early Universe, the energy fraction will depend on the details of the original phase transition. For example, the energy fraction may depend on the size of the transition, the length of the phase transition and the energy density at the beginning of the phase transition.\\\nA reasonable model for the energy fraction is based on the work of [@Hindmarsh:2011qk]. It was shown that the number of superstrings per Hubble volume on the Hubble scale scales with $\\alpha'$ inversely with an overall scale factor $\\phi$, which, if the string network evolves asymptotically with respect to the Hubble value, implies a non-vanishing final value in a flat Universe, $\\phi=1$. This scale factor corresponds to $\\phi=\\sqrt{\\chi}$, with the density parameter of the Universe, i.e. the Universe was initially matter-dominated, with a string density parameter $\\chi$. Following this logic, it is possible to derive the evolution of the network density, for the different phases of the evolution, when combined with a model for the evolution of the network density over time.\\\nThe basic model is based on a string gas model, $\\rho = \\dfrac{\\mu G}{\\alpha'}\\dfrac{N}{V}$, where $N$ is the total number of strings, $V$ is the Hubble volume, and $\\mu$ is the string tension. The model assumes a constant number $N(t) = G\\dfrac{\\mu(t)}{\\alpha'}$ of strings per Hubble volume, such that the energy density is just $\\rho = G\\mu(t)/\\alpha'$. The model is derived under the assumption that the energy fraction is a constant, but with this model set-up, one", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "precise knowledge of x - ray diffraction profile shape is required for the determination of strain). However, if an accurate prediction can be made with the assumption of linear elasticity (as may be the case if the applied strain is in the x-y plane to minimize the effects of nonlinearity) as in Ref. \\[\\], that knowledge can be used for strain measurements on films with complex geometry and/or microstructures.\n\nThe stress tensor in a medium has three nonvanishing components, namely, those in the x-y, y-z, and x-z planes. For a thin film, the stress field is usually measured as the x-y component of the total stress field. However, in a composite with a certain number density of the elastic phase, the stress field may be determined from the x-y component of the stress tensor and the total number density of the system, as may be found, for example, in Refs. \\[\\]. The x-y component of the stress field should be obtained by dividing the area of the interface between the film and its substrate by the surface area of the substrate (i.e., by the effective area of the interface).\n\nThe Young’s modulus of an isotropic material is characterized by the stress-strain relationship\n\n$$\\label{eq:stressteyn}\n\\varepsilon={\\frac{1}{E}}({\\frac{\\sigma}{\\lambda}},0,0)$$\n\nwhere the Poisson ratio has been taken as 0.5, and a simple linear dependence of the stress on strain is assumed. The stress-strain relationship is characterized by its material symmetry and dimensions. The material symmetry will, in general, depend on the crystal structure (the symmetry group of the material) and the dimensions will depend on the shape of the sample and the surface of the sample, and the applied strain. For example, if the Young’s modulus is a scalar, the material symmetry will be orthogonal, while if it is a vector, the material symmetry will be orthotropic. In the case of a tensorial relationship between the stress and strain, the symmetry will be more general than that expected for the ideal case. There is also a wide range of geometries where the elastic moduli of thin films have been determined using a variety of techniques (including the techniques applied in this paper) for example, see Ref. \\[\\]. There, it is also stated that it would be important to use the Young’s modulus at a given strain to find the strains for the entire range of uniaxial strains needed by a particular technology.\n\nWhen a film is strained, it must first deform elastically before any plastic deformation occurs (if any at all). The deformation is usually governed by the Poisson ratio, which is the ratio of the change in the length of the sample along the two directions parallel to the strain direction and the change in the length of the sample perpendicular to that direction. The Poisson ratio is not a physical parameter and it can have any value depending on the boundary conditions such as, for example, the surface states that are on the surface of the sample, whether the sample can be cut and glued to a suitable holder, whether the sample is a thin film on a surface or something else, etc. In any case, the Poisson ratio of a material for any particular sample geometry can be determined experimentally by applying a strain to the sample (the Poisson ratio is a physical parameter independent of boundary conditions), observing the deformation of the sample, using the aforementioned ratio of the length change in the direction parallel to the strain direction and that perpendicular to the strain direction. The Young’s modulus of the material may be determined from the Poisson ratio using Eqn. \\[eq:stressteyn\\]. As indicated above, there is a wide range of Young’s moduli for the same Poisson ratio (due to the Poisson ratio being the ratio of the strain of the material independent of boundary conditions) resulting from variations of both the material and the sample shape, etc.\n\nAlthough it is widely stated that knowledge of the Poisson ratio of a film helps in the determination of Young’s modulus, there is no such statement in the literature. This is because Poisson ratio is a property of the elastic response of the sample (i.e., it is a material parameter as opposed to an experimentally determined property, which would involve, for example, measurements of either the change in sample dimension along strain or the change in sample dimension perpendicular to the strain direction, and the use of the aforementioned ratio of lengths to determine the Poisson ratio), and a Poisson ratio of a sample has nothing to do with the Poisson ratio of the bulk material from which the sample was deposited.

{"text": "Since about the year 2000, a growing number of Internet users have been exchanging messages over the electronic network commonly known as the Internet. The Internet uses the Internet Protocol (xe2x80x9cIPxe2x80x9d) as a network layer protocol. The Internet Protocol enables communication among hosts (also called xe2x80x9cstacksxe2x80x9d) on the network.\nUsers of a stack communicate over the network with other users of the network by exchanging a plurality of packets known as xe2x80x9cpackets.xe2x80x9d The packets contain a plurality of fields, including a header and a data portion. The header contains metadata for the packet, including the destination address of the stack, the origin address of the stack, a sequence number within the stack, the time of reception by the stack, etc. The data portion holds user data, such as a file or image file, and may also contain additional fields.\nIn order to protect against a variety of malicious attacks, users of the network communicate in layered fashion. For example, the transmission control protocol (TCP) provides reliability and provides connection-oriented, sequential handshaking to establish a connection. However, many protocols and applications exist, such as the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Telnet, which operate without the presence of any reliability or connection-based handshaking mechanisms. On the other hand, other Internet protocols, such as the Hypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), operate without the presence of TCP, or any other connection-oriented protocols.\nThe Internet protocol suite (xe2x80x9cIPSxe2x80x9d) is the collection of protocols defined in the Internet Protocol Standards promulgated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (xe2x80x9cIETFxe2x80x9d). This IP suite includes the Internet Protocol, Transmission Control Protocol, and various other protocols. The Internet Protocol addresses most of the limitations of the Internet Protocol in providing reliable handshaking procedures. The Internet Protocol has a reliable delivery mechanism or protocol, the transmission control protocol. However, this reliable delivery protocol uses a reliable sequencing protocol, which is problematic in situations where packet sequence numbers are used in reliable connections. Specifically, because reliable connections are connection-based, no reliable sequencing protocol is used by this connection type. This prevents protocols such as FTP, Telnet, and HTTP from being reliably delivered.\nAccordingly, a protocol known as the User Datagram Protocol (xe2x80x9cUDPxe2x80x9d) has been used to permit the reliable handshaking required by reliable connections while eliminating the requirement to sequence packets. However, a number of problems arise when performing reliable connections using the UDP protocol. For example, the reliability of reliable connections does not typically operate as reliably in environments in which there can be intermittent losses of network packets. Further, reliable connections perform differently from connection-oriented protocols, including TCP, because unreliable connections do not generally provide the reliability associated with TCP, such as the ability to recover from network interruptions. Accordingly, in addition to the packet sequencing difficulties associated with reliable connections, reliable connections are subject to a different set of problems not seen in connection-oriented connections. These problems include problems associated with the different delivery modes of the unreliable protocol, the UDP.\nIn a reliable connection, such as a connection that follows the TCP protocol, both the transmitting and receiving stack keep track of what has occurred when the transmission of a packet is delayed, such as a temporary packet loss. When this occurs, the stack resends the missing packet. This process is performed on a packet-by-packet basis as each packet is being transmitted and thus, as the sending host encounters packet losses and packet delays, it sends additional packets or retransmits particular packets. The transmitting stack knows to send additional packets only upon a specified number of packet losses for a certain number of packets have been encountered.\nFor example, under the TCP protocol, a retransmission timer (xe2x80x9cRTOxe2x80x9d) is generally set equal to a constant of about 125 seconds. If the RTO expires, the transmitting stack will resend the packets that have gone missing. Because the receiving stack must be prepared to receive packets from many different hosts, not every packet is sent by the transmitting stack upon the RTO expiry. Instead, the stack waits for a specified period of time until the stack believes its buffers are free enough to start transmitting packets.\nIn an unreliable connection, such as a connection using the UDP protocol, the transmitting stack simply sends the packets it wishes to send, regardless of a delay in the delivery of the packets. As noted earlier, the transmission control protocol protocol (TCP) generally does not operate in asynchronous fashion. Rather, for every packet, the host maintains the same packet sequencing as packets from another host, and the", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "This film is, quite simply, brilliant. The cinematography is good, the acting is top notch, everything is in order. What is lacking here is the emotional depth of the novel, as you mentioned. But that is a fault of all adaptations.\n\nThere are many good directors (among them, Bergman, Cassavetes, etc.) who’ve taken on these adaptations and, by sheer talent, have actually achieved a good result. The problem for me, is that while adapting the material, they had the desire to please (and they did that, of course) and therefore, some aspects of the novel were altered, changed or lost entirely.\n\nThe director, who’s not mentioned above, didn’t lose or change as much as some others did but he still took away things from the material to make it into a more “accessible” or “polished” film. That is not so much a problem because when he was “pasting on” aspects of the novel in the script, that is what they added in, not what would be the proper “spirit of the material”. However, he still made many changes to the novel, as you mentioned.\n\nIt is difficult if not impossible to completely recreate a novel (whether on a big or small screen) for a multitude of reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, most of the novels you will find in this sub-genre are rather complex, sometimes to the point where it becomes impossibly hard to find an “all encompassing” version of the work.\n\nSecondly, the director will often decide to change some of the things or make it more “commercial”, regardless of any logic in the book the writer has conceived in writing the book. That is just the way of the director and his or her opinion. What a director thinks needs to be changed or added in a film (especially on the big screen) will not be the most appealing thing for all audiences. It’s for these reasons that the novels are rarely, if ever, made into film adaptations and are more likely to be turned into plays (either on stage or in movie theaters) or short films like the one below, which is a nice, short version of “Anna Karenina”.\n\nThirdly, an adaptation of a story like “Anna Karenina” or “The Idiot” would be simply ridiculous if a lot of the things they change (like the time frame, the names, the locations, etc.) are really insignificant to the story. That’s not the end of the world or something that would necessarily compromise the quality of the adaptation. We are talking, after all, about films and not books. They are stories, made for the big screen.\n\nThis adaptation of “Anna Karenina” is quite the contrary. The story and the story’s essence are pretty much identical to the novel but the director’s changes/alterations are quite drastic (a new title, new end/beginning, new characters, a different time frame, changed endings to the story, new characters with “different” names, etc.).\n\nIn short, the director takes the book and changes a ton of things. However, this doesn’t at all mean that the film is bad. It’s not. It’s really awesome, to the point where I would consider it to be a real (and much lesser used genre) adaptation. Like I said before though, for all it’s greatness, this is not the most faithful version of the material in my opinion. However, if I could make a comparison the film would be akin to “The Lord of the Flies” (with the same plot). Both are great films with a great director (Orson Wells, and William Wyler), who were able to take a book that had been turned into a popular play and make something from it that was a real (great) film.\n\nWell, I don’t see why one wouldn’t want to have different names. Yes, people might think “this is an English film!” when they see the title of the film. But, wouldn’t people think (and feel) the same if he would have kept the original title? Sure, Russian names are more common abroad and Russian names are rare around the west. Also, one would not know that the character is from Russia even with the English titles though. Anyway, I just wanted to say that names do count. It’s not as big a problem as you might think for instance with “Alice in Wonderland.”\n\nYes, I know they do.

{"text": "special relativity is reformulated as a symmetry property of space (Lorentz group) and energy-momentum (Poincaré group). In the new formulation, the relativity principle is defined and expressed as the relation between the velocity of a photon, i.e. the speed of an electromagnetic wave. The relation between the velocity of a photon and its momentum is obtained by requiring the conservation of momentum under the action of the Lorentz group, and using the Lorentz equations of transformation. This yields a general equation for the velocity of a photon.\n\nThe new formulation is compared with the original formulation in special relativity. The advantage of the new formulation with respect to the second formulation is that it only deals with space (symmetry group) and time (Poincaré group), whereas the first formulation deals also with energy (Lorentz group).\n\nThe Lorentz invariance of electromagnetic waves suggests that the equations of conservation of energy and momentum could also be formulated in these terms. This leads to new expressions for the energy and momentum of a photon, but only under constraints on the space and the velocity of the photon. The Lorentz symmetry of electromagnetic waves and the energy-momentum formulae obtained in this way make us believe that the new theory is completely legitimate, but a detailed analysis of the general case is beyond our knowledge.\n\nIn the sequel, we focus on a specific problem arising in astrophysics, that is the acceleration of the universe, and which is explained by the presence of a non-zero cosmological constant ([@bib9]). To do this, we start from the fact that the cosmological constant has the dimension of a velocity. It is therefore not a true invariant quantity, but an invariant property of space and time. For the relativistic transformation between two reference frames, where the first is moving at a velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{1}$ in the Minkowski space and the second is at rest in this space, this amounts to the property that the cosmological constant is invariants under the Poincaré group, the group of relativity. It is possible to show that the cosmological constant is a scalar under any Lorentz transformations and hence under the $SO(1,3)$ group, the group of relativity. This gives rise to a transformation law for the cosmological constant in the following form:$$\\zeta\\rightarrow\\zeta_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\zeta_{1}$$where $\\zeta$ denotes the cosmological constant in the first reference frame, and $\\zeta_{1}$ the cosmological constant in the second reference frame. The parameter $\\gamma$ represents the Lorentz factor of this transformation and the subscripts indicate the values of the quantities in the first and the second reference frames.\n\nThe transformation law between both reference frames thus assumes the form of Galilean equations combined with the equation for the evolution of the cosmological constant. This form of the problem is then analysed in more details by taking into account the equation for the evolution of the energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological constant thus arises as an inherent property of space and of time through the conservation of energy-momentum, in particular during the evolution of the universe.\n\n### A.2.1. The principle of relativity {#sec3.1.1}\n\nSuppose that $\\mathbf{k}$ and $k$ indicate an observable quantity, which corresponds to a quantum state described by a vector **k**. Let us assume that $R_{s}$ is a vector which corresponds to a property associated with some physical state of some entity. At an individual level, this entity will have different $\\left\\{ \\mathbf{k}\\right\\} $ values during its life. It can then be assumed that an individual entity has different $R_{s}$ values at different instants of time, and in a given frame of reference, depending on its own state at that time. We then assume this $R_{s}$ value to be some function of **k** and of time. For a system of $N$ particles, we then assume $\\mathbf{p}_{i}$ and $p_{i}$ to be respectively the momentum and the energy of each particle. The state of the particles has now to be described by a vector $\\left\\{ \\mathbf{p}_{i},N\\right\\} \\in\\mathbf{R}^{3\\times N}$ at any instant. The *principle of relativity* (PR) is defined by the condition that the value of $p_{i}$ is the same in every inertial reference frame.\n\nThe problem of time is now to determine whether these properties $\\mathbf{k}$", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the “liberation of the Muslim mind,” a form of religious freedom that would encourage Muslims to reject repressive ideas such as Islamism. For Taha Abdul-Qadir, the Egyptian member of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party (also a candidate in Sudan’s upcoming elections), the project was part of his party’s broader efforts to challenge the idea that Islam is “a political ideology” that cannot be reformed. “The Arab world is not a monolith,” he explained, adding that the Muslim Brotherhood is “skeptical of any ideology that restricts the right to criticize religion.” In Syria, Abdul-Qadir had been working to help “counter the Islamic extremism” in the country by engaging in “dialogs and exchanges,” a strategy he hopes will help Syrians find a “balanced view of Islam.”\n\nThese were the slogans painted on Abdul-Qadir’s office walls, but the real purpose of the funding is much more complex. According to its website, al-Taqwa’s aim was to assist “young Muslims as they challenge what they perceive to be the ‘deteriorating situation’ in the world.” The website further stated that the funds supported “a movement of young Muslim activists who work to strengthen Islam and the Arab identity.” This is not an uncommon goal among Islamic groups operating outside the US – indeed, such organizations often target “Western” donors to their political goals and aspirations. In Syria, such efforts were most likely a response to the Arab Spring. According to interviews Abdul-Qadir and members of his organization gave in 2011 and 2012, they were inspired by the idea of reopening a debate about Islam in the Arab world, at a time when Western values were becoming more dominant and Islam was being discredited.\n\nThese donations were part of a broader strategy to challenge the idea that Islam is a “political ideology” and instead to promote the idea of “a more pluralistic and religiously neutral Islam.” In some ways, it is fitting that such an approach would surface at this time. As the Islamist project has taken root in the Muslim world, the idea of “political Islam” has been discredited. Instead, even many who identify as “Muslims” are forced to choose whether they are liberal, conservative, or more moderate.\n\nThe Syrian and Egyptian branches of Tala’aa also played a role in the funding of their respective groups in other ways. They provided financial assistance for the start-ups of the two organizations – which meant, for example, that Tala’aa Sudan provided the funding of Tala’aa-Libya. In addition, the Egyptian branch of Tala’aa provided “donation” money to fund activities in countries where it had members, including Qatar, Palestine, Palestine, Jordan, and Tunisia.\n\nWhen groups are formed, many questions need to be answers, such as how to structure and who can be involved, what is the role of religion in the movement, what are its goals, and more. An important role of a foundation often is to provide start-up money as well as organizational assistance in such matters. For example, when Tala’aa formed in 2008, the Syrian chapter worked for a time without a permanent home until it was able to move into a facility provided by one of the country’s biggest political parties. The Tunisian chapter followed a similar strategy.\n\nTala’aa provides no information about its funders. As discussed in previous reports (see, for example, here and here), a number of groups have been tied to the Muslim Brotherhood or Hamas, including the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT), the Islamic Corporation Fund (ICF), and the Islamic Charity League (ICL). In addition, Al-Ghuraba is tied to Saudi Arabia’s Alwaleed bin Talal charity because it shares part of its founding with the Riyadh Charitable Organization, which in 2003 was named “the principal financial instrument of Saudi Aramco.” For example, the Saudi Charitable Organization was created by one of Saudi Arabia’s richest investors, Alwaleed bin Talal.\n\nWhat’s Next\n\nThe Egyptian and the Sudanese organizations were able to get their start-up funds from the Tala’aa Foundation, but what will happen to this start-up money now that the groups have become established? Will the funds from the Tala’aa Foundation be enough to meet the costs of activities?\n\nIf Tala’aa’s plan is successful, the Islamic Charity and Support Organization’s work will be replicated in countries throughout the Muslim world.

{"text": "None of the original treaties establishing the European Union mention anything about “reforming” the EU. The Maastricht Treaty did say that the “European Union […] will have as an objective the development of a higher degree of integration among the Member States.”1 But this doesn’t really mean that the EU will “reorganize itself” or that it will “reform itself.” The Treaty also contains provisions concerning the “implementation of decisions” and the “development” of the “internal market.” The latter clause was added in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, and according to the EU official glossery it allows for “structural adjustments” without committing the Union at the same time. (Interestingly, on a later page of the document, on page 26, this interpretation is contradicted. There it says that “decisions on fundamental issues taken after [the 1998] Treaty will require Council authorisations.” Thus the Maastricht Treaty did provide the legal basis for subsequent treaties, but not for fundamental decisions, a major deviation from the common understanding.)\n\nNor is the term “reform” used in the Treaty of Lisbon2 or the Amsterdam Treaty.3 The Lisbon Treaty contains a provision that says that “the Union shall make the most efficient and the most effective use of Union resources, including human resources, on the basis of Community priorities, promoting better coordination, complementarity and efficiency, without distorting competition” – this provision was introduced in the new treaty to ensure democratic approval.4 The Amsterdam Treaty also says that “to strengthen Union effectiveness, its action shall be based on three fundamental principles: ‘more democracy, better law. more openness, better information.’” It gives very general objectives (such as “reform of the working of the European Council”) and broad powers to define how the implementation of the treaty will be (“based on sound Community priorities”, “aimed at enhancing Union effectiveness and at the development of common policies”).\n\nIn sum, and after correcting one mistaken understanding, both the Maastricht Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty do not give any indication of a planned “reform” of the Union, nor of an agenda for such a reform, nor of the need for such a reform. The Treaty of Rome, which formed the EU, contains a specific provision giving “the right to initiate any reform of the treaty,” but there is nothing in that provision to indicate that any such reform is needed or what exactly the reform might be. I find it even more interesting that the Commission and the European Parliament, of European nations, which make up the EU’s ‘guardians’, are never mentioned at all.5\n\nThat the EU is about to “be reformed” is one of the worst-kept secrets in Europe for more than a decade. No sooner did European leaders hold their first European Summit in Nice in 2001 that they were already saying: “We have to modernize the EU.” The German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: “We Europeans need to know whether and how to reform. It is not just about financial matters.” A later German presidency, in 2004, held a conference in Brussels to discuss “reform.” France also announced something that looks like a first serious step in this direction: “We need to renew Europe’s democratic legitimacy.” In Brussels in January 2005, France’s Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin declared: “This is what the reform of the European Union should be all about. I want Europe to be much more than a simple economic union; I want it to become a truly political entity.” In 2010, the French Prime Minister François Fillon proposed a “reform of the integration process, and of the policies and instruments of the European Union, within the context of a multilateral approach which is the most promising for the future of Europe.” The leaders of the Czech Republic and of Poland said a “transformation” of Europe is needed. An interesting interview with President José Manuel Barroso was also reported: “The European Union cannot go on and must change its institutional structure, he said. The European Union must be made a more effective, more democratic and more transparent Union, which is in line with the expectations of the public, he added, “and I’m convinced that the next presidency will focus on the need to improve the EU’s democratic legitimacy.” I may have missed something, but there seems to be little doubt about the need for “reform”, or at least an “updating” of the EU that is already happening today.\n\nAnd what is at the heart of this supposed “trans", "label": "gptj"}

Whether we’re talking about Biblical prophets, Hollywood movies, or real-life zombie stories, the apocalypse is always a compelling story. In fact, the apocalypse is so popular that it has spawned various other fictional stories, including the very popular video game, The Walking Dead. While this type of apocalyptic story is one that always attracts a great amount of attention, what can we learn from these stories? One thing that becomes apparent, even when viewed from a somewhat different perspective, is that they each point to one common and serious problem: human violence.\n\nThere are many types of human violence, and it comes in all forms: domestic violence, child abuse, gang violence, bullying, terrorism, and to name just a few. However, one commonality is that these forms of human violence all share a common problem: they all feed on social systems.\n\nThe first thing that must be clear before we can understand how social systems feed on human violence, is that we have to understand what human violence is–and what it is not. Human violence is not:\n\nIf there are social systems, then human violence, by its very nature, is not going to exist. If there is no social system, then human violence becomes pointless. Thus, human violence is:\n\nSocial Systems Feed on Human Violence\n\nSo, what is a social system? The word “social” is not meant to imply there is a “human society”, which certainly is not the case. It is meant to indicate that there is some social relationship between the social system participants–that is, something inherent to them which makes them interact with others. As individuals with different personalities, desires, and skills, we all have some inborn and learned social patterns. These social patterns are what make us human. Social systems are, then, what we have created–which explains why we have social systems to begin with.\n\nBut, the problem comes when some individual tries to act outside of those social patterns. They may think they are being “real”, but they are in fact acting out of their unique personality and inborn behaviors. This is because of that very unique personality and inborn behaviors–they are not supposed to act out of those unique behaviors in the first place. If they did, there would not be a social pattern in the first place.\n\nNow, these individuals would do well to recall that these very same social systems are there to regulate behavior as well. A social system is set up so that each person will be able to have at least some peace of mind–as well as some ability to flourish, both on personal level as well as societal and collective levels. Human violence is thus, in part, the result of a failure in communication.\n\nHuman violence is usually the result of a situation where, as a society of people, we have created some sort of an artificial social system. The problem comes when some individual does not feel comfortable within the social system because they do not feel that their uniqueness is accepted or taken into account by the system. What then happens is that the individual will look for a way to break that system, whether it is on a personal or societal level.\n\nThis is because the", "label": "gptj"}

(In fact this is true for any node visited by the walker with probability $p$). Then, if the walker “lands” on node $n$ the time to reach node $n$ is $T=T_0 + \\sum^{N+1}_{n=1}t_n$. This sum can be rewritten in the following form: $$\\label{eq.3}\n T=T_0+t_{N+1}+  \\sum_{n=1}^{N} t_n = T_0+t_{N+1}+T_{N+1}.$$ Here $T_0=t_1$ is the first hitting times of node $n=1$ in node $n$ and $T_{N+1}=t_{N+1}+T_N$ is the first hitting times of node $n=N$ in node $n=N+1$ for the first node starting from some node $n\\in \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$. Thus\n\n$$\\label{eq.3a}\nT_{N+1} = T_N+b_n$$\n\nwhere $b_n$ and $T_N$ are now defined by\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nb_n=t_{N+1} & \\text{ and  } & T_N=t_{N+1}+T_{N-1}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe two nodes starting from $n=1$ ($n=N$) will only meet at node $N+1$ ($n=1$) once the walker takes more than $n-1$ steps to reach the final destination. So the problem is related to the time to reach node $N+1$ starting from node $n$ and the first time to reach $N+1$ starting from node $N$ is the difference between these two times, and since both $b_n$ and $b_{N+1}$ depend only on the number of steps required to reach the final node and so do $T_N$ and $T_{N+1}$. However, if there exists a set of functions of the number of steps $T_n(\\ell)$ and the number of times reaching $N+1$ starting from $N$ $B_n(\\ell)$ such that $$T_{N+1}(\\ell)=T_N(\\ell)+B_n(\\ell)$$ then the problem of searching for $T_{N+1}$ is reduced to search for $B_n$ knowing that $T_{N+1}$ is dependent on the number $\\ell$ of steps $T_{N+1}(\\ell)$. To see how this can be achieved, note that $$\\begin{aligned}\nT_N(n)&=\\left (\\sum^{n}_{k=1}k \\right ) + \\left \\lfloor\\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor +\\left \\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2} \\right \\rfloor,\n\\label{eq.4}\n\\\\ \nT_n(n)&=n+1 + \\left \\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2} \\right \\rfloor.\n\\label{eq.5}\\end{aligned}$$ Thus, $T_N(n) - T_n(n) = \\left \\lfloor\\frac{n}{2} \\right \\rfloor$ for $n/2$ is the average number of steps required to reach the final node from node $n$ starting walks from $n/2$. Also we observe that $b_n = \\frac{T_N(n)-T_n(n)}{2}$ for $4n>T_n(n)$. With these notations and definitions, we can write $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{eq.6}\nT_{N+1}(\\ell)=T_{N}(\\ell)+b_{N+1} &  &   \\\\\n             =T_{N}(\\ell)+b_N(\\ell)+b_{N+1}(\\ell) & =&", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition of the system on the lattice. In section 3 we have analyzed the dependence of critical properties of quark-quark-meson system on different parameters of the problem to search the region of confinement phase transition in the phase diagram of the system. The discussion of the results is contained in sec.4.\n\nCalculation setup\n=================\n\nWe used the standard Lattice QCD Monte Carlo approach to study the system under consideration. Our simulations correspond to the lattices with $L_T=32,64$ spatial sites and temporal extent of $N_{t}=10,20$. We used the Wilson action for non-compact formulation of the fermions with the bare coupling $1/g^2=0.70,0.75,0.84,0.90$ at $\\beta=2.6,2.7$ and 2.8. We employed a hybrid algorithm in order to use large lattices to simulate light quarks with chirally invariant fermions and large lattices to simulate heavy quarks with chirally non-invariant fermions on one time slice [@Fernandez:2012]. We computed the observables at fixed $u=s$ (quark mass) and checked for their independence on the total quark mass in order to verify the system on the border of chiral symmetry. Quark masses were chosen so that the corresponding pions are massless. We are interested in the thermodynamics of light quarks with vanishing chemical potential at which we should look for the transitions between different phases of the matter i.e. chiral and confinement. Therefore the physical quark masses were adjusted to be $m_{ud}=m_{s}$ and the light and heavy quark masses were set to be proportional to these quark masses, $m_{u}=m_{s}m_{Q}$ and $m_{d}=m_{s}m_{Q}$ with $m_{Q}/m_{s}>1$, since the light quark mass is much less than the strange quark and heavy quark mass. The light quark $q=(u,d)$ is usually considered massless, $m_{q}=0.005$, but we also considered finite $m_{q}$. In this way we consider the transition from the confined light quarks phase into the deconfined phase. The confinement is realized by the massless chiral fermions at $m_{ud}=m_{s}=0.005$. The number of configurations for the light quark and mesons is collected, in total, above 100000 at $N_{t}=10,20$.\n\nThe calculation of the observables on the lattice and the definition of the model parameter $\\alpha_{\\min}^{s}$ are performed in following way. The fermionic action $S_{q}$ is modified in [@Aharony:2003sx] by the term $$S_{d} = r \\delta r \\bar \\psi_{s}^3\\psi_{s}^3+ \\alpha_{min}^{s} r^2(\\bar \\psi_{q}^3\\psi_{q}^1-\\bar \\psi_{q}^1\\psi_{q}^3)^2$$\n\nThe physical quark mass $m_{s}=0.0005$ is kept fixed and the bare coupling $r$ is tuned in the interval $0.2 \\le r \\le 2.7$ for the four $\\beta$ values. The parameter $r$ reflects the strength of the mixed lattice mesonic couplings, while $\\alpha_{min}^{s}$ determines the amount of the mixed fermionic couplings. The renormalised mixed coupling constant $\\alpha_{\\min}^{s}$ is kept fixed in the region $0.0 \\le \\alpha \\le 0.3$ depending on the $r$ value, for each $\\beta$ value and $N_{t}=10,20$. The value of $\\alpha_{\\min}^{s}$ for the $r =0$ gives the result of the pure lattice model. At this stage one needs to fix the parameter $\\beta_c$. We consider two values, namely $\\beta_c=1.95$ and $\\beta_c=2.17$ where the transition to hadronic phase occurs smoothly, respectively, for $N_{t}=10,20$. At $\\beta=2.6$, for instance, it will be realized for $r=0.4,\\alpha=0.04.$ The bare quark mass $m_{q}^0$ in this case was set to be equal $0.005$ independently", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "This movie was Flippin Awful....I wanted those hours of my life back. I'm so pissed.\n\nThere are a few things though. The first is that it was a perfect storm of good and bad. The idea was fine, but the writing was bad, the plot was bad, the characters were bad. There's a character in this movie called Gail Dern (who I feel really bad for. She got one thing right, what she was going for with that film. But she's got a voice about a hundred years too old. It's not her fault people don't like her, but it's a tough voice.) And she was the catalyst of all the disaster to set up the revenge plot. It was supposed to be Gail who the audience was supposed to sympathize with and then love after she lost her dog, and ended up dying. But it was just such a failure of character. It just came out like a random decision when Gail went home and she'd been working so long on the film and she needed a break and she stopped. You know, it didn't feel right. The script that's supposed to have the big twist ending, where the family goes to the park and sees the dead bodies, doesn't have it in there. I love how it was just like on the end credits, they said, \"In the park scene where people came home from the film and said, 'Oh, that scene where they see the dead bodies on the news?'\" \"Oh...\" \"No.\" \"OK, that was one of our big twists. We said, 'Well, if you knew then, what if you just went and saw it?'\" And I was like, right there's the whole movie you missed seeing 'cause you stopped the movie there.\n\nA good example of the plot being bad is that there was a real plot that a little boy (who's played by that kid, Michael Haneke (from Amelie). I forget his name.) steals his dog, and his big revenge in his movie of the week, his revenge on the town that hates him and his dad for beating up his dog, and all he wants to do is give the kid back his dog. He wants to give it back 'cause he's innocent and everything....\n\nNo, he doesn't. And he brings the police with him to the big town that hated him, and the kid makes him take a lie detector test. He passes the test 'cause he gets to the end of the lie detector test and the film just cuts directly to him saying \"Well, I just wanted to prove that I could get away with it. So, you know, I thought, 'They'll probably just let it go.'\" And the audience doesn't know it's a lie detector test, so they have to be like that's not how it works.\n\nSo the plot is bad, and the voice was out of place, and some of the other things about it that made it just so bad. And it's like I just don't want it to not be a movie, even a bad movie. It was like a bad movie that you just couldn't take your eyes off of because it was just so bizarre. But I just wanted to watch it so I could laugh at it. I think like I said the bad thing about not being able to watch it is not being able to laugh at it. So I'd like to see this movie again.\n\nAlso, I don't think I hate a director that much anymore. I'm so scared of hating this many directors again. We're all probably still at the same spot, so I don't know what to do with this. I liked that one, The Collector, I've liked this one before, Happy End. I know that there are bad ones and great ones and bad ones. And I'm so scared of making that list. Or the other movie I just watched, the very, very bad, bad, bad movie is the last 10 minutes of the movie where you're just like, oh, that was so horrible. You know, that was the part I was waiting for. The bit where they really fall over the cliff into the water and you're like, \"Oh, that was so horrible.\" And it's the best of the movie.\n\nBut I really was waiting for that bit to just happen, and it didn't. In fact, it was better in a way, it was over with before it'd be as bad as it had to be for it...that was the opposite.\n\nThursday, November 19, 2004\n\nI know I already used that title. But I wanted to call this week \"A month of weirdness\" because what's happened this week in my life is weird. So this week, some strange stuff has happened. One thing is that I haven't been blogging as much. Last week, it was 'cause there was a big issue and I was dealing with", "label": "gptj"}

{"text": "It's almost certainly too early to say that the Arizona economy will be \"reborn,\" but a few interesting things have happened in the first month of 2014 in Mesa, the state's largest city, and its county, Maricopa (Phoenix is, and has been, a separate city). It's early, it's small, and the numbers aren't necessarily scientific — but they aren't random, either, so I will tell you what they are.\n\nFirst, the numbers about jobs:\n\nThere are 930 fewer jobs in Mesa itself.\n\nThere are 564 more jobs in Maricopa.\n\nIf you're wondering which county is growing faster, that's not likely to be too complicated: Arizona Central looks at Maricopa's growth first and foremost (because it's growing, and the other counties of Maricopa County all want jobs as well, and they are less likely to grow).\n\nThere are fewer jobs.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that there are fewer people working. There are fewer people in the workforce, perhaps; Arizona's birth rate is dropping, for one thing. But we shouldn't be too surprised — we've had jobs growth in Phoenix, which has the greater urban population. And that isn't going to increase. It's going to decline (unless immigration increases). But it's going to be hard to grow again; the recovery's not there yet (see chart below).\n\nPhoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale jobs growth\n\nCity-county\n\nJan 2013\n\nJan 2014\n\nSource: Arizona Regional Transit Plan\n\nPhoenix\n\n12,000\n\n12,100\n\nMaricopa\n\n5,900\n\n6,500\n\nThe last two years have been great years for Maricopa County, and especially for Mesa County. They were a little better, in the last year or so, but not too much. Maricopa is actually the economic strength for the region, so it's a bit of a disappointment to see that strength wane. It is likely not too long until Phoenix and Tempe are no longer the economic power for the region: that's already partly happened.\n\nIt's also unclear if the local governments can keep up that pace; it is a small city, so it's not easy to \"catch up\" to Phoenix and then hold on to that position after a decade or so, or when Phoenix starts recovering.\n\nSo we should expect to see further job growth in other cities and cities in Maricopa County, especially once the national recovery really gets going.\n\nThere are fewer jobs in the private sector in Mesa.\n\nThe city's decline in private sector jobs is partly due to our larger population (population growth is not necessarily economic growth), but in Maricopa County in the last decade or two, the private sector jobs have moved from the big cities to the far suburbs, to allow the county's suburban population to grow as Phoenix started to recover:\n\nTotal\n\nJan 2013\n\nJan 2014\n\nSource: Arizona Regional Transit Plan\n\nPhoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale metropolitan area\n\nMesa\n\nMaricopa\n\nPrivate sector jobs\n\n5,000\n\n6,100\n\nMesa County\n\n8,800\n\n8,900\n\nTotal\n\nPrivate sector\n\n14,100\n\n15,100\n\nTotal\n\n24,200\n\n26,200\n\nAs Arizona Central has reported before, the suburban growth is now part of the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale area, and has a fairly strong employment boost as a result. Not only is the suburban population growing, but it's growing relatively fast (a few percentage points per year), and it's mostly white (a relatively conservative group). The suburbs' population growth is likely to be somewhat more sustainable, but Maricopa's strong growth rate doesn't necessarily transfer over to its suburbs.\n\nBut, again, Maricopa County is likely to grow faster than the Phoenix area. And the suburbs are, for now, growing faster than Mesa — a sign that the Phoenix Metro Area is not yet at full employment, and perhaps not close to that. (It's possible that our Phoenix Metro Area's employment rate has fallen: it probably hasn't.) It's also important to keep in mind that Maricopa County's suburbs aren't just some big chunk of new residential houses and people. Suburb growth is coming to the city of Peoria, the county seat as well (and home to the University of Arizona — Peoria is Phoenix's satellite, to some extent; Phoenix also has Peoria-Blowing Rock, which is probably as large as the big satellite city, but was omitted due to formatting).\n\nSo Maricopa County is growing (but may not grow as fast as Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale on balance); there are fewer jobs in Mesa (and fewer jobs in", "label": "gptj"}
{"text": "infections still remain one of the most devastating complications in all types of solid organ transplants. The outcome of infection is not only depending on the severity of the initial manifestation of the disease, but the initial pathogen has a big impact on the outcome of the infection. The development of resistance to conventional antibiotics and the increasing number of multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens have made it hard for the clinicians to cure their patients (Rüst et al., 2011).\n\nDue to the high economic investment and increased demand, there is an increasing number of alternative medicine research performed, as it is cheaper to conduct alternative medicine studies rather than to do a multi-center randomized standard clinical trial. The use of medicinal plants for the treatment of infections is one of the successful alternative medicine treatments. Most of these treatments are derived from conventional medicine because they have long history of use (Salah et al., 2004).\n\nThis special issue of *BMC Infectious Diseases* brings together leading researchers to share recent novel data and the perspectives of current practice and practice standards. In this special edition, three reports discuss the progress between conventional and alternative medicine. In the current review, K.P. Kulkarni and S.K. Bhat summarize antimicrobial activity of herbal medicines and their derivatives in a review article and provide suggestions for future studies. K.B. Patil et al. report the antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial peptides based on food by-products. J.G.S. da Silva et al. present the antimicrobial activity of medicinal plants for treatment of tuberculosis. The first review of literature is provided by R.W. Chagas-Filho et al. on the antibacterial activity of natural products such as naphthalenes, phenanthrene, anthracenes, dihydroacridines, amides, and aporphines.\n\nA total of five articles in this special issue focus on the application of traditional medicinal plants for the treatment of infection. These papers demonstrate the pharmacological effects of herbal constituents in a wide range of pathogens. For example, Y.Y. Liu et al. review the anti-infectious property of *Artemisia argyi* Linn. (Compositae) by summarizing the studies on its chemical constituents. *Artemisia argyi* Linn. has a wide array of medicinal properties, including anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anticancer and antimicrobial activity (Li, 1992a). M.P.C. Gomes et al. review the antibacterial activity of alcoholic extracts of medicinal plants against *Enterococcus faecalis*. *In vitro* and *in vivo* antibacterial properties of medicinal plants against some micro-organisms associated with root canal infection have been explored by A.Z. Zargar and G.R. Ramezani. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity of extracts from leaves of *Nigella sativa* has been explored by H.R. Shamsi and L.F. El-Gebali. J.A.D. da Silva et al. review the application of medicinal plants in the treatment of viral infection and suggest the use of medicinal plants in antiviral therapy.\n\n*BMC Infectious Diseases* is a fully peer-reviewed journal that offers prompt and accurate publication for novel research regarding the traditional use and the clinical research. Original research articles, case reports, review articles, review letters, and short communications in a wide range of topics are being published in BMC Infectious Diseases. Thus, it is a highly competitive, rigorous, and fast journal for the publication of high-quality work. Each paper will be independently reviewed in two rounds. The first round peer review is done by the review team and will consider the clarity of the research question, the rationale for the experimental approach, appropriateness of hypothesis testing, appropriateness of the research method, and relevance of the paper to the special issue. Acceptance of the paper will be determined for publication only if it meets the rigorous journal requirements described above. Authors are highly encouraged to improve their papers for submission and publication.\n\nDue to the rapid advance of technology, this issue is just a snapshot of the state-of-the-art research in the field of traditional medicine. One hundred and sixty researchers from around the globe are collaborating on this special issue. It is hoped that these articles will help stimulate and inspire future research in this important area. We will do our best to improve *BMC Infectious Diseases* in coming years to provide the best platform for you to continue publishing your research work.

{"text": "After a very scary, crude opening which gives you that ‘oh fuck’ feeling that you need before the film goes on. From the beginning the camera is held in an interesting angle and gives you this very distorted view of what is going on. This was a deliberate decision on the director’s part to give this sense of danger to the whole film. I also quite liked that the camera kept going through all the sets and locations. This created this sense of chaos that I suppose you would say ‘oh fuck’ because you don’t know if you are going to survive the ordeal you are in or not, whereas with regular films you already know what to expect from each location and set.\n\nAfterwards you got your character’s journey, which the film focuses on for around 40 minutes, and I actually found it quite entertaining because it was funny and I actually quite liked where it went. However, I suppose you could say that it was also a bit long because after you had gone through the characters journey, you then got to know what was going to happen but all the clues were hidden because it was all done in flashback moments. However, by the end everything came together and you got quite an interesting outcome. It is a bit like watching somebody you love die and then eventually you survive. I suppose that is the only downfall which is when they finally got to the climax of the film, that moment when you get to find out what happened, however, that was an interesting way to end the film, because it came back to the beginning with one of the characters’ flashbacks and that came together nicely in the end. I did not feel that the ending was too long or too short because the whole film was very interesting and had good dialogue which helped. I actually quite liked that it was not too long which meant that you definitely would want to watch it one more time just to make sure you had not missed anything. My conclusion is definitely that this is a good film, I definitely do recommend this.\n\nThe movie is a lot like a musical. From the beginning the music plays the key chords and you have that weird sensation you get by listening to your favourite songs, like in that scene where you see the character you love on the screen and everything you could think, he was just as cute if not cuter now that this scene has come, just the way you remember him. It is funny, because in the beginning of the film you know who the character is as it starts with his life which I was thinking is a bit strange because we are at the beginning of the film so why is the focus set at his early life. However, I suppose you could say that the director is just looking out for our curiosity to find out the outcome. All the characters’ journeys take us into their past lives. This is a good way to set up each and every character and what they will be like in the near future. All the questions you would want to ask yourself as you watch this, will the character you are looking at end up becoming the one you love? This way is more interesting than just having a normal drama of someone’s life.\n\nFor a lot of people, they might think that this movie is a bit too cheesy and cliché, because a lot of the dialogue seems like it is straight from the Disney movies but it is not as bad as you would think. As you get to know each and every character he/she will begin to talk more naturally and with the other characters as if they are speaking to you and they are just being them themselves and I really like that, because this is what makes up characters for you, it is the way they talk and the way they express themselves to the other people around them. I really liked that there was not over-acting in the film. Everything played perfectly, like the background score and the way the music was played. For those with the ‘oh fuck’ feeling, this movie will give you that a bit as well because with the weird camera angles and things like that you get this feeling that this is too normal for the film because you cannot even imagine that it could be this good, let alone how good it is. However, I am a bit disappointed that this did not win the prestigious Oscar because it will definitely deserve it, however, I am looking for this for awards to happen in a couple of years because if they do not award this I will probably be so upset and won’t have the heart to watch anything else for a few years because I will be so mad at Hollywood for not awarding this movie.\n\nAll in all, I definitely love this movie and would recommend that you watch it.

{"text": "of the nations of the world and we cannot rule out a future return,” said the\npresident of one of the biggest churches in the Philippines on Oct. 16.\n\nIt is believed only the faithful believe in God. Therefore, it\nis not surprising that a number of people have turned to spiritualism\nto save themselves from depression of any kind. When I was growing up,\nwe were told by adults and children alike that magic and witchcraft are\ndangerous. Some even believed that the power of sorcery is more potent\nthan the power of Jesus Christ.\n\nI wonder what would the world be like today in the absence\nof religious beliefs. Would there be no God and no devil to protect the\ninnocent and punish the wicked? This is the question I am asking myself\nafter reading Pastor Joel T. Maturan’s column that made much news on Oct.\n15.\n\nI agree that the time has come for people to realize that\nsupernatural means God or a godly presence and that religious beliefs\nare an outdated concept. According to the Bible, religious beliefs are\nnot the truth but only a means that people use to worship God. There\nare many truths that we could not comprehend without God, therefore,\nwe have to believe in God.\n\nIt is our religious beliefs that give us strength and\nencouragement to reach for the stars and to aspire for greater things.\nAnd we should continue to follow the God of our fathers, or even the\nGod of our mothers, even if they are of another religion. I urge my\nbrothers and sisters to stop confusing the Bible with superstitions.\n\nIf we do not believe in God, if we reject the Bible,\nwhat will happen to mankind? Would people kill each other with no\nreligious beliefs in the world? I believe that the love of the Lord\nwill triumph, so let us all unite and join forces.\n\nJoel T. Maturan\n\nAlfonso\n\nSister city\n\nThe\nInternational Mission Board (IMB), the U.S. Mission Board of the\nNational Council of Churches of Christ, and the Philippine Church\nSociety, Inc. signed a Sister City agreement to expand cultural,\neconomic and governmental relations between the cities of San Fernando, La Union,\nPhilippines and Davenport, Iowa.\n\nAccording\nto the memorandum of the agreement: \"Local officials and churches can\nparticipate and benefit from this collaboration, and we believe the\ncommunity and the Philippine Church Society in San Fernando can benefit\nfrom our mutual understanding and support.\"\n\nSan\nFernando city government and churches can participate in community\noutreach programs to help youth and residents, with the hope of increasing\nyouth civic participation.\n\nSan\nFernando will receive support of the IMB, and it will be a source for\nsupport of the Philippines, providing resources for evangelism efforts.\nBoth cities will also hold a sister city celebration to commemorate this\nhistoric agreement.\n\nAccording to the Sister City declaration, the United\nMethodist Church and the Baptist Church in San Fernando are ready to accept\nthe sister city agreement, provided the IMB approves of the church's\nplacement in the agreement.\n\nImb.\nPaulina Sotomayor\n\nUnited\nMethodist Church of San Fernando\n\nDavenport\n\nBy Pastor Joel T. Maturan\nOctober 21, 2003\n\nSome\npeople are puzzled when they read about a new church in their community;\nwhat can this church know or do for them? The answer is not in the size\nof the church or in its denomination, but in the heart and desire of the\nleader/pastor. He is concerned not for the denomination or size of his\nchurch but that God is glorified. He knows that the key to growth is through\nother believers and evangelism is the key to making disciples of all nations. A few believers\ndo the needful to build up the church while another group does all the\nchurch works because no one else does anything.\n\nSome\nbelieve in \"me and the money;\" they may go to big and\nimportant conferences, and will try to make the new church fit their\nideal of what it should be like. Their idea may be a good one but should\nnot be forced into their church; God has a plan.\n\nA\nfriend of mine had given a sermon and when I asked her who it was for,\nshe told me, “Don, why don’t you ask your pastor?” Sure I can’t do\nanything to hurt them but I’m sure he has his own ideas about church\nplanning.\n\nThe\ntruth is, there is not one \"church plan\" for all churches.\nIn a small church like mine, we have what", "label": "gptj"}
