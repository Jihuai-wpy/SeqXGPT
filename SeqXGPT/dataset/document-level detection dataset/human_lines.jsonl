But like The Shallows before it, the deep-sea thriller that is entirely about not getting eaten by sharks wildly overperformed its projected box-office take, making more than $50 million around the world on a budget of about $5 million. With that kind of return, it was only a matter of time until the property got a sequel, and now The Hollywood Reporter is saying just that. Writer and director Johannes Roberts will return for, wait for it … 48 Meters Down, which will do some version of the exact same thing, except in waters off the coast of Brazil instead of Mexico. While the first movie revolved around a pair of sisters on a bonding trip, 48 Meters Down will feature a group of girls who want to avoid tourist traps, choosing instead to set out for a more authentic adventure experience.And because this is a sequel about women besieged by sharks while diving, you can bet the sequel — one more meter, exponentially more stress triggers — is going to double down on all the peril. One producer said it will \"take the claustrophobia of cave diving and the thrill of shark encounters and move everything to the next level\" while another promised to \"ratchet up the thrills and spills to a whole new level.\" The THR report does not say anything about Mandy Moore returning for the sequel, but if you were her character, would you ever get in any water that wasn't your own personal bathtub ever again?

{"text": "Feel like you're going through a bit of NFL withdrawal? That's no surprise -- the draft is over and summer training camps haven't begun yet. Fortunately, we have just the thing to tide you over: a new edition of the Uni Watch NFL Power Rankings, where we rank all of the NFL uniform sets, from first to worst.Before we get started, here's a refresher course on the Power Rankings ground rules:• All judging has been done by the Uni Watch Power Rankings Executive Committee, which has a membership of one and freely admits its biases. The committee is rather fond of striped socks, for example, but is less enthusiastic about monochromatic uniforms (solid-red, solid-black, and so on) and takes a dim view of design \"innovations\" that just feel like gimmicks. If you don't share the committee's preferences, then you're totally hopeless and it's a wonder you can dress yourself each morning that's fine -- the whole point of a project like this one is that it's fun to argue and disagree.• Each team has been ranked mainly on the basis of its primary colored and white uniforms, with alternate and throwback uniforms taken into account if they're part of the team's regular uni rotation. Consideration has been weighted to reflect how often a particular uniform combination is worn. The Cowboys, for example, hardly ever wear their blue jersey, so that design doesn't count very much in the team's ranking.• Certain rankings here are, by necessity, somewhat speculative. The Browns' new uniform set, for example, hasn't yet appeared on the field, so we can only go by how the unis looked at the team's unveiling event. Ditto for the 49ers' new black alternate design. In addition, at least two teams -- the Packers and Dolphins -- will have new throwback uniforms for 2015 that haven't yet been released.• For each team listed, you can click on the link below the team's name to see its current uniform set. The number in parenthesis after the team's name (\"+2,\" \"-3,\" etc.) indicates the team's movement up or down on the chart since the previous edition of the Power Rankings.OK, enough preliminaries -- let's get at it.1. Pittsburgh Steelers (+3)View uniforms hereAside from the switch from block numbers to italics (which many fans still gripe about, although it's been nearly 20 years now and we should all just get over it already), the Steelers have stayed the course. They still have their logo on only one side of the helmet, they still don't use helmet numbers during the preseason (you have to earn them by making the final roster cut), they still have that instantly recognizable sleeve striping (the Rolling Stones are even using it to promote their show at Heinz Field), and their gold pants still work equally well with either of their jerseys.

{"text": "The members of the unit, Kompani Linge, honed their skills in fighting and sabotage at Glenmore, near Aviemore, before a clandestine mission in 1943. The commandos attacked a heavy water plant at Rjukan in Telemark, in southern Norway. Germany was using heavy water to control nuclear fission. Erling Lorentzen, one of the last survivors of Kompani Linge, is to be among a Norwegian delegation due to visit Glenmore Visitor Centre later on Friday, Armistice Day. There is a memorial to the Norwegian unit at the centre, and an event marking the 70th anniversary of the attack at Rjukan was held at the monument in 2013. Brian Duff, of Forest Enterprise Scotland, which manages the Glenmore forest estate, said the latest commemoration will have added poignancy. He said: \"As the years go by there are fewer of these men left to mark the exceptional acts that were carried out by the Norwegian commandoes. \"There were many missions behind enemy lines but none more important than that which prevented the Nazi completion of the atomic bomb. \"We have had the honour of welcoming veterans here before but this year we are very privileged to join Mr Lorentzen for a very poignant Armistice Day commemoration at Glenmore.\" Others expected in the Norwegian delegation include special forces soldiers, Norwegian Consulate General, Mona R??hne, Deputy Chief of Norwegian Special Operations Executive Command Eirik Kistoffersen and retired major general Johan Brun. The delegation is to later travel to London for a commemorative event at the Special Forces Monument near Lambeth Palace. In WW2, along with other places in Scotland including Dumfries in the south of Scotland, Glenmore provided a base for Norwegian servicemen and women, who had escaped from occupied Norway. A lodge at Glenmore in the Cairngorms was run by Britain's Special Operations Executive and known as Special Training School SPS26. The Norwegian commandos stationed there trained for one of the most daring missions of WW2. Before the war, heavy water formed as a by-product in production of nitrogen fertiliser. But its properties fascinated scientists. The heavy water plant at Rjukan was the only site in Europe producing large volumes of heavy water. It fell under German control in the the occupation of Norway. After training at Glenmore, the men of Kompani Linge parachuted into Norway and then endured hard winter conditions while hiding on a high winter plateau before mounting their assault on the plant at Rjukan. The commandos used explosives to damage the facility and destroy batches of heavy water. The plant was rebuilt before being completely devastated by US bombers later in the war. Members of the Kompani Linge also destroyed surviving barrels of heavy water loaded on to a ferry, which they sank. The commandos' Rjukan attack inspired the 1965 film The Heroes of Telemark starring Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris and Ulla Jacobsson. It was also recalled in the 2015 television mini series, The Saboteurs, also known as The Heavy Water War, which was broadcast in Norway by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and, in UK, by Channel 4. Other parts of Scotland also have close ties to Norway due to WW2. Stately home Carbisdale Castle, in Sutherland north of Glenmore, was used as a refuge for the Norwegian royal family, while the Shetland Bus was the name given to boats that ferried resistance fighters and refugees between Norway and the Northern Isles. Each year, Dumfries marks its war-time relationship with Norway. The town and the surrounding area provided sanctuary for Norwegian armed forces personnel. About 300 Norwegians arrived in Scotland in June 1940, landing in Hamilton before they were subsequently directed to Dumfries. They received military training in the town and the Norwegian army command later moved there. By 1941, their numbers had reached 1,000 and work got under way building a barracks at Carronbridge, north of Dumfries. ", "label": "human"}

Technically you can obtain these without spending a single cent (with some PvE grinding) or just for a few bucks if you want to speed the process up. In addition to that I've added some important upgrades that you could purchase in order to perform even better. Those additions are by no means mandatory but could give you a little push to realize the dreamy climb to Cosmic Rank. These upgraded lists are able to win against any decks and have proven that through results.I will also share my thoughts on how difficult it is to play those decks – as that might be a factor impacting your choice on which deck to invest in. The decks will be given a difficulty rating from 1 to 5 stars – with 1 star being easy to 5 being extremely hard to play. To be clear those decks once piloted in skilled fashion are all able to get you easily to Cosmic Rank!Training/experience is key and not giving up after some losses is also important. Biggest advice I can give is instead of complaining about loss, to use it as a learning opportunity and analyze what happened because there's a good chance you could have played more optimally. This is especially true at the beginning of your learning curve and please don't forget that the decks, while being cheap, are actually hard to pilot.General Tips For Playing AggroSince most decks on this list are aggro, some general tips for playing this playstyle will probably be useful for those taking their first steps into constructed.-Be sure to attack the most efficient way possible, especially once you are playing high ranked opposition. People will tend to play more and more around your pump actions which means it will be harder for you to play them effectively, but note that this also allow you to bluff a little. Through experience, you will get a better sense of how to act in these critical situations.-When one of your troops is blocked by a Lifedrain troop, there are times when killing your own troop with a burn/kill can be beneficial to prevent your opponent from gaining life. Calculating all the possibilities in your head is of upmost importance when a single point of damage can be the difference between a win and a loss.-Overall sequencing Burn/Pump/Prophecy/Hero power the right way is key for those decks to be successful!-Last advice that is especially relevant for the aggro player: take your time while playing!

{"text": "Officials said most of the immigrants originally came from Haiti but others had come from as far afield as Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria. They said about 1,700 illegal migrants had arrived during the past two weeks. Acre, in the Amazon region, has asked for additional funding from the federal government to cope with the influx. More than 5,000 Haitians have arrived in Acre since 2010, but in recent months there has been an increase in immigration from Senegal, Nigeria, the Dominican Republic and Bangladesh. Officials say the routes through Peru and Bolivia have become popular with people smugglers because dense vegetation makes it difficult for border police to patrol them. Dangerous odyssey Most of those who get caught are housed in a temporary shelter in the town of Brasileia, 280km (173 miles) south-west of the state capital Rio Branco. By Fabio PontesBBC Brasil The immigrants are housed in the former headquarters of a football club - it is a big warehouse-style building, where temperatures get extremely high. The average temperature during this season in Acre is around 35 degrees. Inside, it rises to more than 40 degrees. It can shelter up to 200 people but there are now more than 1,000; some have been relocated to tents outside. Others are sleeping rough in public spaces using their suitcases as beds and pillows. Because there are not enough public toilets, some of them are having to relieve themselves in the woods. The situation is truly chaotic. It is estimated that 10% of Brasileia's 20,000-strong population are immigrants who arrived within the last two years. Many of them are Haitians who fled their country after the 2010 earthquake, which left much of Haiti devastated. Resident Eli Lima de Freita told BBC Brasil that the town was in a state of \"absolute chaos'' as the authorities struggle to house and feed the immigrants. State authorities say dealing with the unexpected wave of illegal immigration has cost them about $1.5m (Â£1m) over the past two years. Haitian immigrants described flying from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, to Panama, then to Ecuador, from where they journeyed on by land to either Peru or Bolivia. From there they crossed into Acre, often paying \"coyotes\" or people smugglers to get them across the border. The Senegalese said they had travelled north from Senegal to Morocco, crossing over to Spain, from where they flew to Ecuador. From there, they continued along the same route taken by the Haitians. For many, Acre is not the final destination. They said they were trying to reach big urban centres in Brazil, such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, but would stay wherever they could make a living. Brazilian police last year raided a number of sweatshops in the capital, Brasilia, and in Sao Paulo, where undocumented immigrants from Bolivia and Pakistan were found working in unsafe conditions for very little or no pay.

{"text": "The Typhoons and six Polish jets will take over from a US squadron to patrol the alliance's eastern flanks. The long-standing rotation of Nato military jets in Lithuania has recently been stepped up in response to rising tensions with Russia over Ukraine. The UK government said the move would provide reassurance to Nato allies. The Typhoons will leave their base at RAF Coningsby on Monday morning and be joined by more than 100 RAF support staff in Lithuania. Only last week Typhoons based at RAF Leuchars in Fife intercepted two Russian bombers flying in international airspace off Scotland. The jets were sent to investigate the Russian planes which are understood to have turned away shortly afterwards. The MoD said fighter planes were scrambled to similar incidents eight times last year. The Typhoons' role over the Baltic states, which rely on Nato for fast jet support, will be similar. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the RAF fighters would provide reassurance to Nato allies at a time of heightened concern about Russia whose jets, the Pentagon has said, have already encroached into Ukraine's airspace. Last month, Mr Hammond told the Commons that the status of Ukraine was \"quite different\" from that of Nato countries. He said: \"Nato countries enjoy the Article 5 guarantee which protects and assures their security, but we are doing everything we can to reassure our Nato allies about the protection we offer.\" \"I am able to advise the House we have taken the decision to offer to Nato UK Typhoon aircraft to augment the Polish contribution to the Nato Baltic air policing mission.\" Later this week about 100 British troops will travel to Estonia to take part in a multi-national military exercise. The Ministry of Defence said this had been planned for some time. In Ukraine, pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country have released one of a team of eight European monitors seized in the flashpoint city of Sloviansk. The officer, a Swede, was freed on medical grounds, it has been confirmed. The monitors were shown to the media on Sunday - a move described as \"revolting\" by Germany, the native country of four of the team. The remaining seven are still being held and diplomacy continues to try to secure their freedom. ", "label": "human"}

The Lib Dems have 191 female candidates out of 630 - or 30%. The Conservatives are still compiling their list but currently have 177 women out of 621 candidates - 29%. A record 191 women were elected in 2015 - around 30% of MPs. Earlier this year, the election of Tory Trudy Harrison in Copeland took the number of women elected altogether in the past 100 years to 456 - roughly the same as the total number of male MPs in the 2015-2017 Parliament. General election: What you need to know Labour's draft election manifesto leaked MPs recommended in January that political parties should be fined if they failed to ensure at least 45% of their general election candidates were female. The Women and Equalities Committee said the fact that 30% of current MPs were women represented a \"serious democratic deficit\", for \"no good reason\" and called for a change in the law after the next general election if that figure did not increase \"significantly\". Both the Conservatives and Lib Dems are fielding a higher proportion of female candidates in the 2017 general election than they had as MPs in the last parliament. Just over 21% of the Conservative MPs elected in 2015-17 were women. Conservative MP Maria Miller, who chaired the Women and Equalities Committee in the last Parliament, told the World at One: \"The Conservative Party has made significant progress, particularly under Theresa May and the the work she's done with the Women2Win campaign.\" Mrs May was a founder of the campaign, which aims to increase the representation of women in the party, along with Tory peer Baroness Jenkin. The SNP is fielding 20 women out of 59 SNP candidates in Scottish seats, or 33.4%. In 2015, the SNP had 36 male MPs and 20 women (35.7%). The SNP's Kirsty Blackman told the BBC that the surprise timing of the election had meant \"less time to reach out to candidates from non-traditional backgrounds\". The Lib Dems lost all their female MPs in their near-wipeout in the 2015 election. The party was reduced to eight male MPs, though Sarah Olney's victory in last year's by-election in Richmond Park later gave them back one female MP. ", "label": "human"}

{"text": "I make it a point to keep up with the latest sex and relationships news but, unfortunately, I find that a lot of the media reports on these topics are not very well written and tend to be overly sensationalized. Part of the problem is that many of the people we trust to report on science don't have a solid understanding of statistics and the scientific method. As a result, I constantly come across articles that are misleading or, in some cases, completely false. What I'd like to do in this article is share some of most sensationalized articles I've come across in recent years and explain where the reporting went wrong.10. Housework Cuts Breast Cancer Risk – Based upon the title, you'd think that the only thing a woman needs to stave off breast cancer is a mop and bucket, right? This is a prime example of how people frequently confuse correlation with causation. Just because two variables are statistically associated does not mean that one is causing the other! It's possible that the association isn't meaningful at all or is explained by something else entirely (e.g., perhaps women who do more housework are just generally in better physical shape and that's what actually accounts for the lower cancer risk).9. Recession Causes Increase in Teen Dating Violence – Notice how the title says the recession \"causes\" dating violence. In the study this article was based on, the researchers found that 1 in 3 teens reported abuse or threat of abuse by a relationship partner. They also found that 3 in 4 teens reported that their families experienced economic problems in the last year. Based upon these two completely separate findings, it was concluded that the down economy \"caused\" the reported violence. This is an astoundingly poor leap in logic, and it doesn't take a degree in statistics to see that.8. Sexual Lyrics Prompt Teens to Have Sex – More correlation/causation confusion. Although listening to sexually explicit music was statistically associated with having sex at a younger age, it doesn't necessarily mean that raunchy music was \"prompting\" sex. There are a ton of other factors that could explain why these variables could be related (e.g., perhaps both are a function of low levels of parental supervision, different personality types, etc.).7. Facebook Causes 1 in 5 Divorces in the U.S. – More inappropriate use of the word \"causes\" (are you sensing a theme yet?). While Facebook may be increasingly cited as a factor in divorce cases, is Facebook really the \"cause\" of so many divorces, or is this just a reflection of the fact that many people cheat and Facebook simply provides a convenient way of doing it?6. Higher Beer Prices 'Cut Gonorrhea Rates' – So if we want to eradicate STDs, all we need to do is raise the price of beer? Sigh. Another overhyped correlation.5. The Pill Can Lead to a Long Marriage of Bad Sex – The original study found that women on the pill were less sexually satisfied than women who weren't taking oral contraceptives.

It suggests the \"mixed picture\" could be influenced by a range of factors, including political uncertainty over Brexit and the stalemate at Stormont. The report was compiled by Ulster University, in partnership with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the Progressive Building Society. It found that the average house price now stands at Â£148,500. The figure has fallen by 3.7% over the year. But the 2,372 house sales recorded between April and June meant the quarter saw the highest rate of property transactions in a decade. \"This latest survey has mixed messages regarding the health of the Northern Ireland housing market,\" said the report's lead researcher, Professor Stanley McGreal. \"Transaction levels are high suggesting a strong market in the second quarter of 2017, however, this optimism is not reflected in average prices which are generally more subdued,\" the Ulster University academic added. Progressive's deputy chief executive, Michael Boyd, said: \"There is no doubt that wider economic and political factors are having an impact including uncertainty following the triggering of Article 50, wage growth lagging behind inflation and the potential for the rise in interest rates.\" But he added that there was still \"confidence\" in the housing market, as Northern Ireland remained \"one of the most affordable regions of the UK\".

And when he makes contact on those pitches, they're generally being hit in the air — Haniger's average launch angle for the season is an almost ideal 13.3 degrees for his brief career.The fact that he's avoiding groundballs so often allows him to get away with the fact that he isn't hitting the ball especially hard. His current average exit velocity is 87.1 on the season. It's not Billy Hamilton, but that's a comfortably below-average figure, especially for a corner outfielder. But because even those relatively weakly hit balls are being hit up, rather than down, Haniger's results have been excellent nonetheless.However, even those somewhat poor exit velocity numbers are cause for optimism. In Haniger's major league debut last September, he had an average exit velocity of 93.1, well above league average. It's the same average Josh Donaldson had last year, though Donaldson obviously it over a full season.Still, even if Haniger's true talent exit velocity is somewhere in the middle of his 2016 and 2017 numbers, that's a number we should expect to improve going forward.

TUV leader Jim Allister tells the Telegraph: \"In Northern Ireland, of course, such prioritising of prisoners is only too common.\" The department's website says: \"The range of temporary release schemes has been developed to provide both determinate and life sentence prisoners with structured and planned releases towards the end of their sentences.\" The News Letter says that Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson was cheered by fellow MEPs when he told them there is no legal entity called the north of Ireland. He was speaking during a European Parliament debate on a Sinn FÃ©in-backed call for Northern Ireland to be given special status post Brexit. The amendment was rejected by 374 votes to 66, in what the paper calls a blow to Sinn FÃ©in's \"diplomatic offensive for designated special status\".

However, he has been put on a waiting list and has not been given a letter of refusal which he needs to register with someone else. \"The irony is that I have private health insurance through work - but I can't get anything done because I need a GP referral,\" he tells the paper.

To do so, we will have to think beyond particular candidates and specific elections. We will have to think more radically, to propose more fundamental reforms. The Constitution of 1787 offers far too many nooks and crannies in the cobwebbed architecture of our political system in which Republicans can hide out and bide their time before attempting another hostile takeover of our democracy. Because the founders-approved option of amending the Constitution is, for the time being, unavailable to us, we will have to figure out ways of amending it without formally amending it, in order to end the artificially enhanced prominence of a party that has been so malignant in its current form. Ad PolicyFirst, we need a plan to immediately end the gerrymandering of congressional districts.

{"text": "PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - The owners of a Portland-area bakery who refused on religious grounds to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple have paid about $144,000 in damages despite their ongoing appeal of the discrimination case, a state official said on Tuesday.The damages were ordered after Aaron and Melissa Klein, owners of the Sweet Cakes by Melissa bakery, refused to bake a cake in 2013 when Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer were planning their nuptials.Aaron Klein handed the state a check for nearly $137,000 on Monday, Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries spokesman Charlie Burr said. The payment was first reported by the Oregonian newspaper late on Monday.The money was added to $7,000 received from the Kleins earlier this month through private collection efforts spearheaded by the state's Department of Justice, Burr told Reuters.After the owners' refusal to bake the cake, the state bureau found they had violated anti-discrimination laws because their shop is not a registered religious institution. It ordered them to pay the Bowman-Cryers $135,000 in damages.The Kleins appealed the ruling and had refused to pay the damages, citing financial hardship.Burr said the shop owners subsequently raised about $500,000 from supporters via an online crowdfunding effort.The damages had been accruing interest since the damages were ordered due in July. \"We were in touch with their attorneys in giving precise amounts in what they needed to pay to cease collection efforts,\" Burr said.The Kleins' lawyer, Tyler Smith, said the bakery owners are \"devoted to honoring God in every aspect of their lives, including how they conduct themselves in this litigation.\"In order to pursue their appeal, he said in an emailed statement, Oregon law requires that the Kleins either pay the damages or obtain a bond for the imposed amount.The least expensive option to stay in compliance with the law was to pay the funds that the labor bureau will hold in a separate account \"until they prevail in their court appeal,\" Smith said.Burr said the state will hold the damages until all appeals are settled. The case will go to the Oregon Court of Appeals next year and could ultimately go to the state's Supreme Court.The Bowman-Cryers were married in 2014 after a federal judge struck down Oregon's same-sex marriage ban.The bakery case is one of many disputes nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "During his visit to the US, he enveloped Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg in a massive hug and reprised the embrace with President Barack Obama in New York. In August, he hugged the crown prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan,  inspiring some droll memes. Mr Modi has also hugged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The mother of all hugs came in January with a humongous embrace of President Obama. Delirious Indian news channels ran tickers screaming 'Modi/Obama hug' because, as The New York Times reported, \"this was not expected\". The newspaper dubbed the development as a \"quadrilateral security hug\". Whatever the case, Mr Modi has learned to stop worrying about public displays of affection when he meets the rich and the powerful: Google \"Modi hugging\", and it spits out more than 300,000 results in under a second. Indians and their politicians are not known for being so touchy-feely. Cuban leader Fidel Castro scandalised many Indians when he gave former prime minister Indira Gandhi a huge hug during a summit in Delhi in 1983. Mrs Gandhi, wrote a biographer Pranay Gupte, \"never an emotionally demonstrative person, visibly recoiled from the hug, managing only a faintly polite smile in the interest of diplomatic niceties\". Even Mr Modi was different in his early days as a party functionary in Delhi. Biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay remembers him as a \"warm and affectionate man and his overall body language touched a chord\". Much later, as the chief minister of Gujarat, he could be a \"bit cold and remote\" with his peers at meetings, \"shaking hands and maybe touching somebody on his shoulders if he knew somebody particularly well\". \"But this is different, this hugging spree. He was never so overt and aggressive in his public display of affection,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. \"His bear hugs are to convey the message that he's the representative of more than a billion Indians. He's saying 'I have demographic clout'. \"And he's sending the message back home that 'I am being respected around the world, so respect me at home and give me your votes'. It's a powerful piece of imagery.\" People see before they hear, and a leader's body language is a vital asset. The ritual of shaking hands is all about restraint and respect. Hugs go beyond the formal protocol - they show affection, comradeship and spontaneity. Mr Modi, clearly, believes that hugs fetch more dividends; they are not about cuddly politics alone. The body language is also tweaked to cater to different audiences. Sociologist Shiv Visvanathan says Mr Modi has three core audiences: the diaspora, foreign leaders and the Indian people. \"To the Indian masses, he speaks from a great distance. To the diaspora, he speaks with a sense of conviviality. To the world leaders, he changes his body language, gives them big hugs,\" says Dr Visvanathan. \"The effort is too obvious. He's trying to tell the world that he's an equal, a friend and he's very affectionate. Mr Modi is a performer. At the same time, he has become a caricature of himself. This worries me. I would like my leader to have more confidence.\" ", "label": "human"}

We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.<br /><br />I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.<br /><br />I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative.

{"text": "Mr Mutharika, who died in April, changed it to a full sun to reflect what he said was Malawi's move from a developing to a developed nation. A BBC reporter says the move was deeply unpopular with the people of Malawi. \"You cannot rewrite history midway for no apparent reason,\" the justice minister told the BBC after the vote. A former economist, Mr Mutharika governed Malawi for eight years, but had latterly been accused of mismanaging the economy and becoming autocratic. Following his death, his vice-president, Joyce Banda, took power and has reversed many of his policies. She had fallen out with Mr Mutharika over his succession plans and left his Democratic People's Party (DPP). The government bill to revert to the flag first hoisted at independence in 1964 was supported by all opposition parties - except the former ruling DPP. \"A flag has got a very fundamental significance,\" Justice Minister Ralph Kasambara told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. \"The flag is part of our association with the independence struggle, the history of the country,\" he said. He condemned Mr Mutharika's justification for changing the flag, adding that it was \"absurd\" to say Malawi was a prosperous country. The BBC's Joel Nkoma in Lilongwe says the President Banda has scored several political points with the move as most people he spoke to on the streets of the capital have welcomed the return of the old flag. The DPP says spending money on changing the flag again should not be a priority at a time the country is facing economic hardships. But our reporter says the DPP no longer has any political clout, having lost its parliamentary majority since President Banda took over after Mr Mutharika's sudden death from a cardiac arrest. At least half of its members have left to become independents - or crossed the floor to join President Banda's party, our correspondent says. President Banda needs to sign the bill before it becomes law. Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 75% of the population living on less than $1 (60p) a day.

{"text": "Ever since the UPA government mooted the Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project (SSCP) in 2004, it has been a target of criticism from environmental advocates as well as religious enthusiasts. The project envisages excavating the shallow sea between the Palk Bay and the Gulf of Mannar to create a narrow shipping passage, linking the east and west coasts of India and obviating the current 'hassle' of circumnavigating Sri Lanka to reach the eastern coast of India (and vice-versa).The total length of the channel is estimated to be 152.2 km. Creating it will require two phases of dredging (or even blasting, depending on the nature of the substratum) the 20-km-long coral-reef platform known as 'Adam's Bridge' or 'Ram Sethu', as some like to call it, and the 54-km long Bay of Bengal segments. The third segment falls in the Palk Bay, with a total length of 78 km and which reportedly requires no dredging as this area has a clearance depth of 12 m.Sethusamudram, as the name suggests, is that part of the ocean being constantly bridged by natural sedimentation processes. Like the Great Barrier Reef off of the northeast coast of Australia, Ram Sethu is a continuous stretch of limestone shoals that runs from the Pamban island near Rameswaram to Mannar Island off of the northern coast of Sri Lanka. Because the ocean floor is shallow in this area, natural processes have formed coral platforms here for millions of years.During a glaciation period 20,000 years ago, many parts of the Indian coast including, parts of Sethusamundram, may have been exposed above water. From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago, seas level steadily rose around the world due to glaciers melting. As it did, the coral polyps could once again have grown higher on the newly submerged platforms. And in time, the platforms may have been used by human migrants to cross over the oceans. The Indian epic Ramayana refers to a putative land bridge in this region; believers hold it as the structure that Lord Ram and his army built to reach Lanka.An initially assessment by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) ruled out any environmental risk and certified the feasibility of the project. However, serious concerns have been raised from different quarters on the stability of the proposed canal and the environmental impact of this project. Its total cost is Rs 25,000 crore.Government agencies entrusted with this work at that time seemed to show an extraordinary enthusiasm, brushing aside uncomfortable questions and keeping the public in the dark about the canal's stability and adverse environmental impact. However, using an interim order in 2007, the Supreme Court had stayed the dredging of the Ram Sethu after admitting a plea that it had immense religious value for Hindus. Subsequently, the UPA government was compelled to constitute a committee in 2008 headed by R.K. Pachauri, then the director-general of The Energy and Resources Institute, to explore the possibility of an alternative route that would not affect Ram Sethu's integrity. His committee found that the project could pose a serious threat to the ecosystem", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Isabelle Sanders, 51, was stabbed to death by Paul McManus, 20, during a robbery at her home in Crookston. McManus was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 26 years. Ms Sanders' brother James Dougall says whole life terms would protect the public from violent criminals. During a trial at the High Court in Glasgow last year a jury heard that Ms Sanders was stabbed 37 times during the robbery. McManus was also convicted of attempting to murder her partner, Norman Busby, 86, and two robbery-related stabbings. After the trial, it emerged McManus had been released from a previous sentence just weeks before the murder. The judge who sentenced him highlighted his \"significant\" criminal record, which included convictions for theft, assault and robbery and the use of weapons. Lord Armstrong pointed out that the 20-year-old had already served seven sentences of detention. Ms Sanders' family has lodged a petition with Holyrood's petitions committee which they hope will attract widespread public support. Her brother, Mr Dougall, told BBC Scotland: \"It is maybe not applicable for every violent offender, but certainly for violent reoffenders who get the chance of early release and then go on to reoffend and who disregard that chance they have been given and go on to commit violent murder specifically. \"I think (in these cases) the whole of life sentence is an appropriate option for the judiciary and guidance should be given to them that they will be allowed to impose that type of sentence. \"So the petition we have started is 'life means life' - that judges have that option for whole of life sentencing in specific circumstances.\" Though not used in Scotland, whole life sentences are used by judges in England. The Scottish government has highlighted the fact that judges already have the power to impose a sentence which will exceed the rest of a person's life. A government spokesman said: \"Scottish courts have the power to impose the equivalent of a 'whole life tariff' in any given case. \"The independence of Scotland's judiciary is a fundamental part of the Scottish legal system. As such, sentencing is a matter for judges who operate independently of Scottish ministers and it is for our courts to decide what sentence to impose in each case before them. \"The Scottish government has previously announced the creation of a specific Scottish Sentencing Council which will promote consistency and transparency around sentencing and encourage better understanding of sentences across Scotland, as well as producing sentencing guidelines for the judiciary.\" ", "label": "human"}

The international terror threat scale was first made public in the UK in August 2006, just over a year after the London bombings that killed 52 people. There are five ratings at which the threat level can stand. Since its introduction, the level has never fallen below what is known as \"substantial\", and it hasn't been that low since August 2014. The highest level \"critical\" has been activated twice before. The threat level was first raised to \"critical\" on 10 August 2006, just nine days after the scale was published, following the discovery of a plot to blow up planes flying from Britain to the USA on as many as 10 flights. The only other time the threat level was raised to \"critical\" was following the car attack on Glasgow Airport on 30 June 2007, in which the only fatality was one of the assailants. On neither occasion was the threat maintained at that highest level for longer than four days. Before being moved up to \"critical\" on 23 May 2017, the threat level had been held at \"severe\" for 998 days.

There is one scale for potential action within Northern Ireland and another for terrorist action on the Great Britain mainland. Currently those levels for the risk from terrorism associated with Northern Ireland, are assessed as \"severe\" within Northern Ireland and \"substantial\" for the GB mainland.

Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units.

{"text": "The message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; the mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world. When war finally does arrive, it's ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed. Adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the \"\"wandering sickness\"\", a pestilence that continues for another four years.<br /><br />\"\"Things to Come\"\" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. The \"\"Wings Over the World\"\" concept plays out a bit corny, though it's spokesman Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly in Massey's end of movie speech. Man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an \"\"all the universe or nothing\"\" mindset.<br /><br />The film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film \"\"Metropolis\"\". As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition. Where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969.<br /><br />\"\"Things to Come\"\" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. Which side will you come down on, the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo?

{"text": "If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. It's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.<br /><br />As for Flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan's depiction of General Custer in \"\"Santa Fe Trail\"\", both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers, while in Flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. But it doesn't come close to that of Richard Mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's \"\"Little Big Man\"\". Let's just say that one was a bit over the top.<br /><br />The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view. Earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custer's character, when he stated - \"\"You take glory with you when it's your time to go\"\".\"", "label": "human"}

The Afghan-born American had returned a \"completely different person\", according to the friend. He seemed more stern and wore religious Muslim clothing. Mr Rahami lived with family members above his place of work, First American Fried Chicken, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Childhood friend Flee Jones said Mr Rahami had given him free food and space in the restaurant to hold rap contests. Mr Jones said Mr Rahami was formerly his basketball partner, but that he had changed after returning from trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan. \"It's like he was a completely different person,\" Mr Jones told the New York Times. \"He got serious and completely closed off.\" Friends say Mr Rahami travelled to Quetta and Karachi, Pakistani cities that are home to a large community of Afghans who have fled conflict in their country. What we know so far Quetta is considered to be a haven for leaders from the exiled Afghan Taliban. According to US media reports, Mr Rahami married while in Pakistan. New Jersey congressman Albio Sires said Mr Rahami had contacted his office in 2014 during a visit to Pakistan. He said his constituent had requested help obtaining a visa to bring his spouse to the US since her Pakistani passport had expired. Citing law enforcement officials, CNN reported that Mr Rahami's wife had left the US in the days before the attacks. US officials are working with Pakistan and United Arab Emirates officials to contact her, according to the report. According to US media, Mr Rahami was found with a notebook that contained ramblings about terrorists following his arrest. It reportedly referred to the Boston Marathon bombers and also mentioned Anwar al-Awlaki, the American imam killed by a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Mr Rahami attended Middlesex County College in Edison, New Jersey, where he majored in criminal justice, from 2010-12, but he did not graduate according to school officials. Recently he appeared to have been taking on more responsibility from his father in the running of First American Fried Chicken. But neighbours' complaints about rowdy behaviour from patrons outside the all-night takeaway spot led city officials to pass an ordinance requiring the place to shut at 10pm each night. Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said Mr Rahami's father had sued the city in 2011 over the ordinance. He said he had been ethnically discriminated against, but lost the case. This is not Ahmad Khan Rahami's first encounter with law enforcement. In 2014, he was arrested on weapons and aggravated assault charges after he allegedly stabbed someone in the leg in a domestic incident, court documents showed. Another patron of the fried chicken restaurant, Ryan McCann, said the bombing loved talking about his souped-up Honda Civic. \"He's a very friendly guy, that's what's so scary,\" said Mr McCann.

{"text": "Three major state museums in St. Petersburg — The Hermitage, The Catherine's Palace in Pushkin and The Russian museum — see visitors lined up in long queues. What's normal for summer time looks unbelievable under current weather conditions with 20 C under zero. An even half an hour wait may cause light freezing injury (we've tested it ourselves), but visitors prefer standing for once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see works by Aivazovsky or the Amber room.Taking a picture of the queues is not easy as a camera's battery becomes low very fast. Under minus 20 degrees Celsius, the equipment doesn't want to work long and prefers to get switched off after 40 shots and 15 minutes.St. Petersburg authorities and non-governmental organizations opened stations where homeless people can come and warm up to avoid injuries or death from low temperatures. The St. Petersburg circle road administration issued a warning that the icy road increases the risk of traffic accidents and limited the speed on the road to 70 km\\h instead of ordinary 110. The emergency service and transport companies are on high alert. The demand for heating units and felt boots has significantly increased since the low temperatures period started two days ago.It's even more surprising to see long queues for the biggest and most popular museums in St. Petersburg at the times when most people prefer staying home.The queue for The State Hermitage museum was no less than 300 meters long (including a part in an inner yard where the entrance to the museum is). You can see the queue on cover picture.The day on which the photo was taken was January 5, a free admission day which can partly explain the love for standing about an hour in line getting face, arms and legs gradually frozen. Though on Wednesday the queue was reported to be of the same length.The Russian museum is a bit less popular, but anyway has its own nearly one hundred meters line. The visitors are being allowed in by portions due to overcrowded space inside. Pictured also on January 5.The Catherine's Palace featuring the Amber room has also a superb park that's worth visiting at any time of the year (in the winter the entrance is free). Though we could not find strengths to join the queue to visit the museum as a 10 minute walk in the park on January 4 under -19 C urgently prompted us to a cup of coffee and half a liter of hot mulled wine at a nearby coffeeshop. And the camera's battery had become low though it indicated a full charge before leaving out.That all is rather strange even for many Russians themselves, but true.We can offer only two explanations to why people prefer standing lined up for often over an hour wait to see arts and sometimes with kids (!).St. Petersburg is one of the most popular destinations within Russia for the long January holidays. Many people are coming here from across the country to visit museums which the city is well known for and not willing to miss the opportunity", "label": "human"}

GLIFAA President Regina Jun and Atlantic Council Executive Vice President Damon Wilson also spoke.Berry in his speech noted that a dozen countries now contribute to the Global Equality Fund, a public-private partnership the State Department manages with USAID to promote LGBT rights around the world.The LGBT Core Group at the U.N. includes two-dozen countries and an observer state. An international LGBT rights conference that is scheduled to take place in Uruguay in July is expected to draw advocates and officials from around the world.Berry specifically applauded Chile, Colombia and other Latin American countries for advocating for LGBT-specific issues on the U.N.

{"text": "A film for mature, educated audiences...<br /><br />I saw \"\"Random Hearts\"\" in an advance screening shortly before its North American release. This romantic drama was quite a treat. I'm sure this story will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially considering the film's darkly downbeat premise. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor.<br /><br />All-time Box Office Draw Harrison Ford (\"\"Star Wars,\"\" \"\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\"\" \"\"The Fugitive,\"\" \"\"Air Force One,\"\" \"\"Patriot Games\"\") is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate Internal Affairs officer, Dutch. Ford's very subdued, nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for Harrison Ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. Next year Harrison Ford returns to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis (\"\"Forrest Gump,\"\" \"\"Back To The Future\"\") in his summer 2000 thriller, \"\"What Lies Beneath,\"\" and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of Tom Clancy's \"\"The Sum Of All Fears.\"\" 'Fears' will be Harrison Ford's third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack (\"\"Out of Africa,\"\" \"\"The Firm,\"\" \"\"Tootsie\"\") has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to Scott-Thomas' congresswoman. It's a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors around (see \"\"Eyes Wide Shut\"\" as well).<br /><br />Kristin Scott-Thomas (\"\"The English Patient,\"\" \"\"The Horse Whisperer\"\") shows that you don't necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite Ford's quiet-man toughness.<br /><br />The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving Ford's character's investigation into police corruption. Look for a chilling & effective turn by \"\"Heat\"\" actor, Dennis Haysbert, who plays Detective George Beaufort, the obstacle to overcome in Dutch's investigation into police corruption.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. Charles S. Dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best character-actors around, and Bonnie Hunt, who I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as Wendy Judd.<br /><br />The technical side of Pollack's thriller is top notched. From Dave Grusin's (Pollack's \"\"The Firm\"\") perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score, to Philippe Rousselot (\"\"A River Runs Through It\"\") crisp photography, to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh, despite the film's unfortunate downer premise.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, well-paced plot, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. This is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and certain to be controversial endings for a Harrison Ford film in recent times. \"\"Random Hearts\"\" is definitely one of the better films of the year.<br /><br />(***1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)\"", "label": "human"}

And like U.S. and Canadian cities, conditions change from year to year.Click here for State Department warnings by Mexican province.Accreditation for Mexico Weight Loss SurgeryThe Joint Commission, the most respected and demanding hospital accreditation agency in the U.S., has an international division called the Joint Commission International (JCI) that accredits hospitals in Mexico.To receive certification, hospitals abroad must pass detailed testing for 300 standards with 1,200 specific data points that JCI surveyors examine and score. Here is a general overview of what's reviewed:Access to care and continuity of carePatient and family rightsAssessment of patientCare of patientsAnesthesia and surgical careMedical management and usePatient and family educationQuality improvement and patient safetyPrevention and control of infectionsGovernance, leadership, and directionFacility management and staffStaff qualifications and educationManagement of communication and informationIf a hospital outside the U.S. is JCI accredited, you know that they have passed the on-site 3 to 5 day hospital review within the last 3 years. This is an indicator you are traveling to a hospital where they put a premium on safe practice. There are a total of 4 hospitals in Mexico that are JCI approved and perform weight loss surgery.For further information on JCI accreditation, check out their website to get a better idea of their impressive standards. (Joint Commission International accreditation standards).Achieving JCI accreditation is an expensive, lengthy and rigorous process for a hospital. Most hospitals don't have the means to pursue JCI. Fortunately, there is another credentialing agency that screens hospitals for excellence.The Mexican Ministry of Health offers a reputable accreditation known as the CSG (El Consejo de Salubridad General, which means \"The General Health Council\") that is modeled after JCI accreditation. CSG has a specific set of standards to address international patient safety. CSG accreditation serves as an indicator that you're going to a well respected hospital with a safe track record.We ran a survey on 20 Mexican hospitals and clinics that perform bariatric surgery and found that 8 are CSG accredited, which means that less than half of your options fall in the accredited category.Non-Accredited Options for Bariatric Surgery MexicoWhat if your prospective hospital or clinic lacks certification from either the JCI or CSG?Rest assured, there are great clinics and hospitals that are not accredited for a variety of reasons.

But in their zeal to drive Donald into the ground, the media wouldn't let go.Unfortunately, Trump's famously thin skin doesn't allow him to explain himself, as he could in thirty seconds, not that the MSM would give him a chance anyway. They are so appalled by his candidacy that they won't let one idea leak through lest their sainted favorite, Mrs. Clinton, look bad by comparison. She is running an ideas-free campaign, particularly in the area of foreign policy where her record from Iraq to Libya to Iran, as Trump pointed out in Monday's speech, is atrocious. Thus the press resorts to unending attacks on Trump's rhetoric with the blinded American people as the victims.But more of that in a moment. First, the speech, which was a good one and delivered with a teleprompter. (Every morning, before he does anything else, Trump should kneel down, clasp his hands together, and recite to himself: \"The teleprompter is my friend.\")The key part of the address was the welcome specificity on Muslim immigration. Some of his earlier pronouncements on the subject were more explosive than necessary, though they did bring attention to a subject on which most leaders are afraid to speak, for which Trump deserves credit.What Trump now is aiming for is what he calls \"extreme vetting\" of potential Muslim immigrants to keep us safe. What does that mean, besides being extra careful and erring on the side of \"no\"? To begin with, it means not being afraid to profile, something the current administration considers anathema. But Trump was indeed more specific. He cited Sharia law as being incompatible with the Constitution and values of our country, which indeed it is, and said all adherents of Sharia should be kept out. Good.Trump made a comparison here to the Cold War, when communism called for the violent overthrow of the U.S. government. Sharia and jihad, in their extreme forms, indeed in practically all forms if you read carefully, call for the same thing, but on a religious basis. (One of the most bizarre ironies of our time is that the left seeks to protect Sharia with all its rampant and repugnant misogyny and homophobia. I'd love to see Bill Clinton try to explain that one. He might break the world record for parsing.)Trump also called for working with allies to defeat ISIS, again specifically naming Israel as our greatest ally in the area before he cited any others.

A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth. He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, \"more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education. Both are reflected in higher rates of growth.

Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\"Nevermind that the American people had elected President Obama with a clear majority in 2012 for just this purpose.Following suit in a televised debate on CBS later that night, the Republican candidates for the White House were unanimous in their insistence that a \"lame duck\" president should not have the power to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.Ted Cruz claimed there are \"80 years of precedent of not confirming justices in an election year\".As Elizabeth Williamson points out, \"It's not clear what Mr. Cruz was talking about (and some Republican Senators were also making that claim). Justice Anthony Kennedy was nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 after his two previous nominations of Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg collapsed. He was confirmed in 1988, during an election year, when Democrats controlled the Senate.\"Indeed, Justice Kennedy's confirmation included \"yea\" votes from Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, who will oversee the incoming confirmation process.Perhaps forgetful of his own voting record, Sen. Grassley said on Saturday:\"The fact of the matter is that it's been standard practice over the last 80 years to not confirm Supreme Court nominees during a presidential election year.\"Of course, as steadfast hypocrisy goes, this only gets better.The late Justice Antonin Scalia was nominated by President Reagan in July of 1986 and confirmed on September 17th, just 48 days before Election Day, when Democrats regained control of the Senate.There was no bickering over \"unfairness\" of the process. There was no demand that President Reagan, a lame duck Commander-in-Chief facing the prospect of losing the Senate, wait until the next session of Congress to put forth his nominee.There was the Constitutional mandate of the President and the duty of the Congress to confirm or reject the President's nominee.Senators Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley, then the junior and much more youthful members of that legislative body, had no such qualms with the process. Both voted for confirmation of Justice Scalia.And in the years since, neither senator has expressed regret over that decision.This is the modus operandi of Congressional Republicans. When things go their way, the system is working just fine. When the rules are inconvenient, the Constitution suddenly becomes a living document open to interpretation.Perhaps Sen. Elizabeth Warren best summed it up:", "label": "human"}
{"text": "After Tuesday's play-off defeat at Luton, she said she would not go into partnership with Wrexham Supporters' Trust (WST) to buy the club. Her spokesman said she had received death threats, not reported to police, after becoming involved with Wrexham. Mrs Booth's withdrawal comes on the same day a winding-up order against the club was dismissed. The order, brought by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, was dismissed at a short hearing at the High Court in London after Wrexham paid off its £200,000 tax bill last month. This was done through a combination of donations and loans, but despite this, ownership of the club still needs to be resolved. Mrs Booth, who runs hotels and other businesses in the Llangollen, Wrexham and Mold areas, has been linked with the takeover for several months. The club first announced it was looking for a buyer in January when owner Geoff Moss and chairman Ian Roberts said they were stepping down from the board. Several bidders have said they are interested. Former footballer Ashley Ward, who started his career at the club, said he had held preliminary talks while businessman Stephen Cleeve outlined his interest on the Red Passion website. But since Mrs Booth and the trust announced they would work together they have been seen to be favourites. Last month the club survived a £200,000 tax demand when the money was paid off thanks to a combination of donations and loans. It cleared the way for the team to take part in the end-of-season promotion play-offs but Tuesday's defeat to Luton dashed hopes of a return to the Football League. After the defeat Mrs Booth said she was withdrawing from attempts to buy the club. She told BBC Radio Wales when she first launched her solo bid for the club the financing was in place. She said she was then asked to form a joint bid with the trust. \"I've urged them to meet and discuss the detail. They have declined and they've been meeting with two property developers. \"Why would two out-of-town property developers with no links to Wrexham want to buy a loss-making football club? She said her bid involved moving the football club and its assets - including the Racecourse and Colliers Park - into community ownership. \"It's never ever, ever going to make money as a football club or as a joint football and rugby club. \"[The Racecourse is] an important asset and it should be used for more than 3,000 people. \"It should be used by the population of Wrexham town.\" Spencer Harris, board member of WST, said: \"As a board of supporters, we've seen some of the statements made in the press by Stephanie Booth this morning and I have to say we're really disappointed that Stephanie would conduct herself in this way. \"I guess the key things are the board of the Wrexham Supporters Trust only ever received an outline proposal from Stephanie. \"That proposal lacked any detail and a formal proposal of what she was actually suggesting or putting to us never in fact materialised.\" He said WST was \"willing to talk to anybody who's got the interest of Wrexham Football Club at heart\" and would hold a public meeting on Tuesday at the William Aston Hall to make its position clear.

{"text": "Almost 200 people were injured in the crash near the south-eastern city of Wenzhou. \"Missteps\" by 54 officials led to the disaster, the long-awaited official report says. The crash led many Chinese to accuse the government of putting development and profit before safety. It also triggered a wave of popular anger against officials who were accused of trying to cover up the seriousness, and causes, of the crash. After receiving the report, China's cabinet criticised the railways ministry for lax safety standards and poor handling of the crash, according to Reuters. Premier Wen Jiabao was presented with the official investigation's conclusions at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The accident occurred after one train stalled following a lightning strike, and then a second high-speed train ran into it. Four carriages were thrown off a viaduct. The report found that serious design flaws in control equipment and improper handling of the lightning strike led to the crash. More serious penalties could follow for some of the 54 officials criticised in the report. Among the officials singled out was the former railways minister, Liu Zhijun, who was sacked before the crash, accused of corruption. Liu \"has the main leadership responsibility for the accident,\" the report says. Following the accident, the authorities called a temporary halt to new high-speed rail projects and placed speed restrictions on trains. China had planned to lay 16,000km (10,000 miles) of high-speed track by 2015, which would make it the biggest high-speed rail network in the world. It had hoped to make its rapidly developing railway technology an export success: Chinese train companies were aspiring to compete with Germany's Siemens and Canada's Bombardier by selling their technologies to foreign companies. But after July's crash that looks less likely. The railways ministry said on Friday that it planned to invest 400 billion yuan ($63bn; Â£40bn) in infrastructure construction in 2012, which is lower than the figure for this year. The current minister, Sheng Guangzu, said that rapid railway development should be maintained, as it \"plays an important role in the country's social and economic development, especially in boosting domestic demand,\" according to the Chinese government's website.

Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.<br /><br />The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.<br /><br />I give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. I think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo, but it does matter for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is, why his character would be attracted to hers, but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his.<br /><br />Still, the movie works as a light romantic fantasy. The scene where she stares at him across the cat's head, with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring, is true magic. It's a little jarring, therefore, when the scene shifts to the top of the Flatiron Building, and we see the age difference very sharply. As he embraces her, she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair, but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "\"If Europe fails on the question of refugees, then it won't be the Europe we wished for,\" she said. She was speaking after Austrian authorities arrested five suspected people smugglers along the country's eastern borders. On Thursday, 71 dead migrants were found near the Hungarian border. Austrian police say more than 200 others were found alive overnight. Ms Merkel said European countries must share the burden of refugees. Germany is the main destination for migrants arriving on the EU's eastern borders and expects the number of asylum seekers it receives to quadruple to about 800,000 in 2015. Mrs Merkel said \"Germany is a strong country - we will manage.\" But she said there would be \"no tolerance for those who question the dignity of other people\" after a spate of arson attacks on refugee shelters and anti-migrant demonstrations. \"The number of people... helping strangers get through cities and communities and even taking them into their homes is far greater than the number of xenophobes,\" she went on. Mrs Merkel's call for greater co-operation was echoed by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who warned that Europe's migrant crisis would be a \"long and difficult challenge\". Also on Monday, trains from Budapest carrying hundreds of migrants were stopped at the Austrian frontier. Austria's rail service OeBB said the route from Budapest was facing severe disruption due to \"overcrowding\". Austrian police said they would turn back anyone on board who had made a request for asylum in Hungary - but it is not clear if this actually happened. Once in Austria, migrants would have two weeks to decide whether or not they wanted to claim refugee status there, police said. Trains were later allowed to proceed and hundreds of migrants arrived in Vienna on Monday evening. Many of them immediately boarded trains bound for Germany. Austria also introduced extra checks on vehicles entering from Hungary on Sunday evening, causing long traffic jams on Hungary's major roads leading to the Austrian border. The Austrian checks appear to undermine the EU's Schengen system, which normally allows unrestricted travel. But in exceptional circumstances countries can reintroduce border controls under Schengen. Austria's Interior Ministry told the BBC the checks would not be necessary if there were an agreement to distribute the migrants fairly. The head of the European Union's police agency, Rob Wainwright, said catching people smugglers would be easier with more \"effective\" border controls but added that the Schengen system had pros and cons. Five people have been detained in connection with the deaths of 71 people, most of them thought to be Syrians, in a lorry found last week on the A4 at Parndorf. Austria was shocked by the gruesome nature of the deaths. Thousands rallied on Monday demanding better rights for migrants. As well as the bodies in the lorry in Austria, hundreds more people drowned in the Mediterranean last week while trying to reach Europe from Libya. A record number of 107,500 migrants reached the EU's borders in July. The UN says the continuing conflict in Syria is a major factor behind the rise in migrant numbers. Greece, Italy and Hungary have particularly struggled with the surge of migrants from not only Syria but the rest of the Middle East and Africa. An extraordinary meeting of EU interior ministers is to be held on 14 September. Why is EU struggling with migrants and asylum? Some governments have refused to take in refugees and resisted EU proposals to agree on a common plan. Others are tightening their policies on asylum and border security, sometimes because of rising anti-immigration sentiment. On Sunday France condemned Hungary for building a razor-wire fence along its border with Serbia to try to keep out migrants travelling north from Greece via the Balkans. UK Home Secretary Theresa May blamed the Schengen system - which the UK did not join - for \"exacerbating tragedies\". She has demanded tighter EU rules on free movement. ", "label": "human"}

Karenzi Karake was detained at London's Heathrow Airport on Saturday, in response to a European Arrest Warrant. He is accused of ordering massacres in the wake of the 1994 Rwanda genocide. The president said that the British authorities \"must have mistaken [Gen Karake] for an illegal immigrant. The way they treat illegal immigrants is the way they treat all of us\". He added that the British had been patronising, \"wagging a finger at the African and telling him this is where you belong. We are no longer the African that belongs there\". Gen Karake, 54, appeared in a London court on Thursday and was greeted by cheers and clapping by supporters as he arrived in the courtroom. A full extradition hearing will take place on 29 and 30 October. Gen Karake, whose defence team includes Cherie Booth, former British prime minister Tony Blair's wife, said in court that he would fight his extradition. Africa Live: latest updates In Rwanda, protests have continued outside the British High Commission in the capital, Kigali. Protesters have threatened to remain until the Gen Karake is released.

Spanish investigative judge Andreu Merelles indicted Gen Karake in 2008 for alleged war crimes, along with 39 other current or former high-ranking Rwandan military officials. He is also accused of ordering the killing in 1997 of three Spanish nationals working for Medicos del Mundo. ", "label": "human"}

(Reuters)The number of millionaires in India is growing strongly and at the end of 2015 around 2,36,000 high net worth individuals were living in the country, with a combined wealth of $1.5 trillion, says a report.According to the India 2016 Wealth Report, by New World Wealth, while most countries worldwide have experienced negative or negligible growth since 2007, India has performed \"very well\" in terms of wealth performance through this period.\"During our review period, Indian HNWI volumes increased by 55 per cent from 1,52,000 HNWIs in 2007 to 2,36,000 HNWIs in 2015.

This will make India one of the top five performing HNWI markets in the world over this period (in terms of percentage of HNWI growth), along with Vietnam, Sri Lanka, China and Mauritius,\" it said.The 135 per cent rise will be fuelled by strong growth in the local financial services, professional services and media sectors.The main factors that encourage wealth growth in a country include, strong ownership rights and the country scored 9/10 in this metric, followed by strong economic growth (9/10).A well-developed banking system and stock market was also a factor as it encourages the people to invest their money within a country and grow their wealth locally, the report said.The report however, noted that excessive government regulations are a major hurdle for new businesses in India.\"Corruption is also a major problem – businesses often need to pay regular bribes to government officials in order to operate successfully. This problem has improved over the past year since Prime Minister Modi took office,\" it said.It further noted that India is often cited as a difficult place for overseas investors to do business – there is a lack of transparency in several parts of the economy and the cost of starting a business in India is very high.\"India also ranks as one of the worst countries in the world for the ability to enforce a contract, taking an average of 1,420 days,\" it said.", "label": "human"}

His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. However, once you've heard it, you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again.

{"text": "Other predecessors of the Reformed church included the pro-reform and Gallican Roman Catholics, such as Jacques Lefevre (c. 1455–1536). The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them.

Author Kenny Moore adds in his book \" Bowerman and the Men of Oregon \" that Bowerman's approach was like that of a \"physical scientist,\" and that he constantly evolved his strategies.Through this method, which also pioneered the use of film to analyze performance, Bowerman \"developed and guided 24 NCAA individual champions, won four national team titles and coached the U.S. track and field team in the 1972 Olympic Games ,\" according to his biography at the National Distance Running Hall of Fame, to which Bowerman was inducted in 2002.Bowerman wanted to create lighter apparel and shoes for his runners, and went to a local shoemaker for guidance.

{"text": "*Criticism does mention spoilers*<br /><br />I rarely make user comments, but this is one movie I have no problem slandering. This movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were, despite what its ad claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow- I actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie's character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse' hands). The movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolie's character and Denzel Washington's. Of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie, I was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off. Anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window). The cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think the murderer's intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial 'chess game' and gets with his pet project, Angelina.<br /><br />If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like I am), you will not appreciate this film. If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single Hollywood cliche ever borne (the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer, the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship, the horrible 'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka SOTL) , see this movie....but even then its too slow-paced and you'd be bored.\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Man With a Golden Arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think of the three this one is the best.<br /><br />Maybe if Otto Preminger had shot the thing in the real Chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet. Who knows, maybe Preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for the location. It's the only flaw I find in the film.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss Robert Strauss when the game was raided. He took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him.<br /><br />First Bob Strauss who wants him back dealing, especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town. He uses a few underhanded methods to get Sinatra's services back. Secondly Darren McGavin is the local dope dealer who wants Sinatra good and hooked as a customer again. And finally Eleanor Parker his clinging wife who's working a con game to beat all, just to keep him around.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra got a nomination for Best Actor for this film, but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn't won for From Here to Eternity in the Supporting Actor category a few years back and that Marty was such an acclaimed film in that year. His scenes going through withdrawal locked up in Kim Novak's apartment will leave you shaken.<br /><br />Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role. She's really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants Sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost. If she had not been nominated that same year for Interrupted Melody, she might have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the high point of her career. <br /><br />Darren McGavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler. His performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl.<br /><br />Elmer Bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak Chicago neighborhood the characters live in.

Somehow, Shapiro's name was omitted from the headline on Buzzfeed's home page.Breitbart news editor-in-chief Alex Marlow was stupefied: \"My friend Ben Shapiro broke the news on a website that asks its staff to drink their own urine?

{"text": "It is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film. I read the book before, and I found the BBC production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible. The qualities of the book haven't been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from Sue's point of view then from Maud's one. The main actors do very good, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other, because they still love each other.<br /><br />For each of her books the author, Sarah Waters, has thoroughly investigated what life was like in British 19th century. While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research. This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense.\"", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Charles Dunne and Chris Cadden were on target before Morton's Gary Harkins was shown a straight red card. Richard Tait and Louis Moult added second-half goals. Elsewhere, Kris Boyd bagged a double as Kilmarnock won 2-0 at Annan Athletic to move top of Group E, and Hamilton won a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw at home to Queen of the South in Group G. In the other Group E match, Clyde beat Dumbarton 2-1, while Queen's Park overcame Edinburgh City 3-0 at Hampden in Group F and Albion Rovers won 5-2 at East Kilbride in Group G. Premiership side Motherwell quickly took control at home to Championship outfit Morton, with summer signing Dunne nodding home before Cadden finished after excellent build-up play. Harkins was dismissed for a poor challenge on Craig Tanner and Well made Jim Duffy's side pay after the break. Tait produced a fine finish for the third and substitute Moult netted an excellent free-kick to complete the scoring and take the hosts a point clear of their opponents at the top of the group. League One Queen's Park went third with a comfortable win over League Two Edinburgh City. Dominic Docherty got the scoring started from close range and a Chris McKee own goal doubled the Spiders' lead before Anton Brady's dig from distance put the result beyond doubt. At Galabank, Killie found their feet early on and the excellent Dominic Thomas set up Boyd for a simple finish. The Ayrshire side dominated the match but only added one more goal, with Boyd drilling an effort into the bottom corner after 62 minutes. Clyde are third in Group E, also on six points, following their win over Dumbarton. Craig Barr nodded Chris Johnstone's delivery home to give the Sons the lead but Darren Miller squared it with a cracker into the top corner. Max Wright headed the winner after 67 minutes. In Group G, Hamilton took the lead against Queen of the South thanks to an 88th-minute Steven Boyd goal, but Stephen Dobbie replied a minute later to ensure both sides earned at least one point. The Premiership side took the bonus point with a 6-5 win in the penalty shootout. Queen of the South are top of the group, having played a game more than Accies, who are third. Albion Rovers are second following their 5-2 triumph at East Kilbride. Goals from Alan Trouten and Gary Fisher gave the visitors an early two-goal lead and Connor Shields made it 3-0 after the break. Shields added his second before Sean Winter's goal and a Michael McMullin own goal gave East Kilbride hope. Shields, however, completed his hat-trick soon after to seal the win. The eight group winners and four best runners-up progress to the knockout stage where they are joined by the four teams in European competition - Celtic, Aberdeen, Rangers and St Johnstone. Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson: \"We're happy, especially with the manner of the win. Our workrate and energy to win the ball back was the biggest thing for me. \"Louis Muolt has come on in two games and scored two goals, but we still want to add to the squad. I still feel there's more to come. \"(Moult) is a Motherwell player at the moment until someone tells me different. It will be the right amount of money or he will stay and you can see by his performances, workrate and attitude that he's 100% committed to us. \"We set a marker today where we want to make it horrible for teams to come here, we want to press the life out of them and make it a real competitive game.

{"text": "In Ireland, private schools (Irish: scoil phríobháideach) are unusual because a certain number of teacher's salaries are paid by the State. If the school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world. There is, however, a limited element of state assessment of private schools, because of the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish private schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example. Many private schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. The average fee is around €5,000 annually for most schools, but some of these schools also provide boarding and the fees may then rise up to €25,000 per year.

{"text": "I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this was playing at the cinema I couldn't help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen's work) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop's most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen.<br /><br />I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson's performance but I am a bit bias, I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. She plays a ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen's stereotypical neurosis stricken character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character sickeningly cute and that is a plus.<br /><br />Allen is Allen... He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late...<br /><br />Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave, millionaire murder suspect. I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less.<br /><br />In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh... In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective-like than anything. However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt. Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners. I did find his allusions to his last film interesting... Come for the humor, laugh and be merry.<br /><br />Needless to say if you enjoy Allen's work watch it. If not watch something else...\"", "label": "human"}

{"text": "abstractthe hair microstructures of korean terrestrial mammals from 23 species ( 22 wild   and one domestic ) were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) to   construct a hair identification key .  the hairs were examined using the medulla structures   and cuticular scales of guard hairs from the dorsal regions of mature adult animals .  all   cuticular scale structures in the hair of rodentia , lagomorpha , carnivora and insectivora   showed the petal pattern , and those of artiodactyla and chiroptera showed the wave pattern   and coronal pattern , respectively .  rodentia , lagomorpha and carnivora showed   multicellular , and insectivora and artiodactyla showed unicellular regular , mesh or   columnar in the medulla structures , respectively .  chiroptera did not show the medulla   structures in their hair .  we found that it is possible to distinguish between species and   order based on general appearance , medulla structures and cuticular scales .  thus , we   constructed a hair identification key with morphological characteristics from each   species .  this study suggests that hair identification keys could be useful in fields , such   as forensic science , food safety and foraging ecology .", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Review: Against Me!, 'Transgender Dysphoria Blues'toggle caption Ryan Russell/Courtesy of the artistThe bracingly political Florida punk band Against Me! has been a going concern since 1997, but Transgender Dysphoria Blues can't help but feel like a debut: It's the group's first album since singer Tom Gabel came out as a woman. Now named Laura Jane Grace, she still barks her lyrics with fiercely assertive intelligence — with a voice as yet largely unchanged from the one in the band's earlier work — but Against Me!'s subject matter can't help but be turned on its head.It's right there in Transgender Dysphoria Blues' title that Against Me! intends to address Grace's new identity upfront: This is a coming-out record first and foremost, from its opening line — \"Your tells are so obvious / shoulders too broad for a girl\" — through songs that channel her fears and characteristic defiance. At times joltingly profane, Transgender Dysphoria Blues doesn't let up for 29 brisk minutes, but real tenderness and vulnerability surfaces in the melee. In \"Unconditional Love,\" Grace repeats the self-lacerating line, \"Even if your love was unconditional / it still wouldn't be enough to save me\" — a terrifying and revealing notion, even as Grace remains by all accounts happily married to her wife.Against Me!'s music only addressed gender issues in passing before Transgender Dysphoria Blues, so the album certainly qualifies as a left turn. But the end result is just as catchy and anthemic as the terrific speedball punk records that precede it. Gabel always told the truth as he saw it, so it makes sense that Laura Jane Grace would do the same, with the added benefit of comfort and courage in her own skin.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "If you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called \"\"Outlaw Seas\"\" or \"\"The Outlaw Sea\"\", and it describes, in story after story, how these things do happen. The lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. One, many of the world's freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and it's difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country. Two, many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. The crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. Three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. The crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. Four, once committing an illegal act, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. Anyway, it's fascinating reading.<br /><br />Horrifying story, excellent movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important movies? Hollywood has trouble releasing enough Oscar worthy movies in any given year, so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema.<br /><br />I loved the thoroughly evil performance by Sean Pertwee. I also, as usual, loved Omar Epps.\"", "label": "human"}
