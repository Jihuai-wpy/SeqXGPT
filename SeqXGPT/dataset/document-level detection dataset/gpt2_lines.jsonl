{"text": "It was 8am on a Sunday in April. Three of the six teams at the tournament had already dropped.\n\n\n\"Myself, I said, 'It's a great opportunity. If they go back to the table after that and come up with some new ideas, it could be something we could look at and see what it is and how to replicate that',\" McIlroy told ESPN.\n\n\nHe soon found out just how great a potential idea this would actually be.\n\n\n\"The idea was to have a more casual setting, less intense,\" McIlroy says. \"I don't know what went through their heads but after talking with them, it was, 'OK, this is a lot more fun.'\n\n\n\"When I got there, it was a very relaxed setting, very easy going, which I was able to use to my advantage. We talked at length about how to break things down and I ended up taking some away from that and putting it into the game.\"\n\n\nMcIlroy's idea of breaking things down was to have the players walk the course wearing a special jersey with the time on it showing the score of each hole and one of five players with an \"X\" next to their name.\n\n\n\"You walked on and shot and could see where each player ranked against the other, where you were compared to them and where you should improve on your game,\" says McIlroy. \"The kids loved it. They loved the fact they could see what they were doing and know where their strengths were and where they needed to improve to get ready for the next round.\"\n\n\nThe players also enjoyed the opportunity to work with a pair of instructors that McIlroy knew would be supportive and eager to work with them.\n\n\n\"One of them was a guy that had won before and is a great teacher,\" McIlroy says. \"The other guy was a really good friend of mine who I hadn't seen in a while and was an instructor. I thought they were great to just come over and play with in an informal setting. It ended up being a really fun environment. It wasn't like a competition.\"\n\n\nThe idea was that the players could go back to practice over the summer months and then on Nov. 17 at Trump National Doral in Miami, they would play a final round at Trump National with the results being tallied up.\n\n\nIt sounds like an ideal outcome, but when McIlroy arrived there was one problem.\n\n\n\"I wasn't informed of it in advance,\" he says. \"I saw the players in their clothes the Monday before and there was absolutely NO instruction. I was surprised. I came in just a little bit overconfident. The first half of the week there was like, 'What do we do? Should we play something or stop and do something?'\n\n\n\"Finally, I made the call and said, 'All right, time's over and we can start it now.' No need to worry about it further. There was something in the works, no need to worry about it at that point.\"\n\n\nInstead, the players spent the rest of the week with McIlroy working on his game. And while the first few holes were pretty easy, the competition got tougher from there.\n\n\n\"I played really hard that week,\" McIlroy says. \"I was just playing around, not trying to be nervous or anything, just trying to do what I thought was right and trying to understand that we were still not fully on our feet from last week. I could feel it at the end of every week. I could feel it the day of the first round at the tournament.\"\n\n\nMcIlroy ended up finishing eighth. The players he played weren't as well known as some of the competitors that had won at the past three tournaments, which made them difficult to beat.\n\n\nHe also lost to Tommy Fleetwood on the last hole. But in the two weeks that he spent there, he learned a lot.\n\n\nAnd it is those lessons that have helped him prepare for the next two trips he will take to California for the US Golf Championship and the Tour Championship.\n\n\nLast week, he made the decision to come back a final time to prepare for the U.S. Open next month, and if he keeps his pace and wins there that will certainly make him a better player.\n\n\n\"I thought it was well worthwhile, honestly,\" he says. \"The lesson that I take away from this experience is to not look at the other things that may or may not be important to me.\n\n\n\"The things that matter to me are the things that are important to me as a golfer. What are my strengths, what am I doing that I can improve on in my game? I think it's a lot of things to it. The golf part of it is just another part of that whole game. You don't have to think about it for the golf part of it.\"\n\n\n", "label": "gpt2"}

I would never have a girlfriend/boyfriend that doesn't understand the things i do for him and also for the wrong reasons. My \"bff\" would be like a little kid without parents to show them the stuff we do and why we do it.

If so, how did your first go?\n\n\"\n\nWhat happened next, is how she got this job in the first place. When we asked to look into the matter, we got this response:\n\nTo: [redacted]\n\nFrom:\n\nMy friend and fellow former employee, [redacted], just called me...I am just going to start from the beginning - let me tell you this: I have known redditors for many years, mostly young guys. I know that they're all young men who are into gaming, reddit.com, etc. I'm sure they'd love to have me. I'm going to say that about 75% of redditors are female. But I have a great experience with most of them too.\n\n[Redacted] has done over 100 AMAs in various forms of media and in several niches. But the main job of \"her,\" is to be their female friend/professional/friend and to look out for them, and keep them safe. I know this sounds strange.\n\nLet me give you some examples: When I used to work at Reddit, I had a female coworker who was a professional gamer. One day reddit got a post about a hacker who was stealing money from users (this is the real story behind the story, I can't link it because there is a court case pending), and they wanted all their employees to help with that issue. Since it was a new issue of stealing money, she sent the reddit team an email. She talked about how she wanted to volunteer her time in a different subreddit in order to handle these issues, get the word out about it, and encourage other users here at reddit to make their own accounts and help with this. When I asked her what other reddit subs she volunteered in before, there were over 4 in the community.\n\nWhen redditor who's name I forgot tried to tell her about how he had been hacked too (a reddit post), reddit user \"r/AskReddit\" came to his post and took note of that. One of the admins I talked to told me that I was a great guy to volunteer for that. It was his responsibility. I know this sounds weird and I'm not saying I did anything wrong, but it's just how redditors are.\n\nI know redditors. They all know each other and are usually good human beings. But this was the first time we had asked redditors if we could ask a female to do an AMA. I thought that this was going to be a big deal. I was right. One woman did an AMA in the last year. I think the other admins (myself included) agreed that the whole situation would be great if the other redditors would volunteer themselves to help. A few more subreddits would be made for \"our\" benefit. It worked. A lot of redditors got interested in the community (and this is reddit, so no matter, the community was just big). So now if a redditor wants to volunteer, she calls us and we get to choose a suitable subreddits for her to do an AMA in.\n\nOne moderator was trying to help me choose reddit and decided to call me and ask what kind of redditor i was. The next I realized they wanted me to choose them (so they wouldn't have to, if they didn't want to, because they could do an AMA anytime). One of the admins was asking me what a redditor was and that it was different if you were an male or female. She then asked me if I considered myself male or female. I told her I was really not sure, that I was unsure about things because I don't have gender assigned pronouns on my birth certificate and the name I use doesn't match my birth certificate either.

{"text": "the evolutionary processes that have enabled bos taurus cattle to survive have persisted until now, despite their large size (Holland et al. 1997); however, it was not always the case, because of a variety of social factors, including genetic constraints and the occurrence of intraspecific competition.\"\n\nDorset's cattle are smaller, and the population densities are lower (Holland et al. 1997), but they have been able to make up their losses by interbreeding. According to Holland (1997), although there is no suggestion that they are interbreeding with anything, a small amount of interbreeding with cattle from east of the Avon is observed from time to time.\n\nAlthough they have remained distinct from bovine populations, these herds have produced hybrids, so it is possible that boviniculture will continue. The cattle were introduced by Thomas the Conqueror in 1086 – at least they were for a while. Thomas was the King of the Wessex people (originally called the Normans) and in an attempt to consolidate control of Wessex, he and his sons conquered parts of the continent and introduced them into England through his allies in East Anglia.\n\nIt is believed that the introduction was influenced by the British Isles native cattle. Although the cattle's domestication took place during the 437 year English Civil War, the English cattle are an offshoot of the Welsh. In the 4th century a group of people began to make a living with cattle in the British Isles, and around the turn of the 6th century they started to breed them in order to increase their numbers. These people were the Britons, a people who had been in Britain since the earliest of times (at least, as far back as the Bronze Age or as in the Middle Ages). Over time the British developed more domesticated breeds of cattle with better nutritional balances and more space to roam.\n\nIn the 11th century the first cattle were brought to England by the Normans, and they remained here until around 1480. The first Welsh cattle were brought to England in the 15th century by a man, William the Conqueror, and although breeding between their own cattle and those of the Britons continued, from around 1490 the Welsh and their breeders began to breed cattle with cattle elsewhere, and their own cattle became extinct.\n\nThe first records about what happened to the Welsh cattle are in the writings of Edmund Saxon, in his works Cattle and Landed Cattle (ca. 1480), Cattle and Landed Cow (around 1545), and Cattle and Landed Beef (1558). These works describe the Welsh cattle's decline over the centuries as they moved north of the river Taw, and their demise at the hands of the English bull eared cattle imported from continental Europe (also called bullock eared cattle), which replaced the Welsh. The new eared cattle were smaller than the Welsh, less fertile and much more prone to disease (Saxon 2002) The English bull eared cattle eventually replaced the Welsh as the dominant cattle in Wales, causing the English to call the Welsh cattle \"bulls\".\n\nOther European cattle have also been introduced into Britain, but have not replaced the original Welsh cattle in the population. The first European cattle to be introduced to Britain were Holsteins imported from Germany in the 15th century. These cattle had much less of an impact on the British population than the Welsh. In the 17th century a Dutch breed of cow, called the Holstein, escaped to the British Isles from Holland where it had been domesticated as a working animal (Klein 1995).\n\nMore cattle were brought to Britain as cattle from Italy arrived, and in 1801, the East Anglian farmer Joseph Strachan discovered a colony of cattle in a field he was working on about five miles north of Bristol. Strachan began to breed cattle with the cattle of his neighbors, and by the 1920s thousands of small, white bulls, called English bulls by the British, had been produced. This gave rise to the term English bull or British bull\n\nWhen the English bull or British bull breeders began to produce a smaller breed of bull than the original, breeders called this the Irish bull. However, during periods of mass beef consumption or when large quantities of sheep and cattle were slaughtered for food, the large Irish cows and bulls became a liability (Klein 1995). As a result of the slaughter of their cows before they produced enough beef, Irish cattle had low milk production, and many became disease carriers. The Irish bull breeders then increased production of the Irish bull by cross breeding. This made Irish bull cattle a much larger and higher quality animal than the English bull or British bull breeders had been producing. As a result, the Irish bull became the breeding cow of choice throughout the UK. By the 1930s the Irish bull breed had passed to its first purebred offspring who are the famous Highland cattle, the Highland White.\n", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "On 23 June 2005, Rep. Joe Barton, chairman of the House Select Committee on Science and Technology, released the results of an investigation into the \"Science\" section of the Department of Energy (DOE) site on Salk's behalf. [3] In his May 2004 statement on Salk's death, Barton wrote that \"a new investigation shows that Dr. Sabin did not die as the result of a contaminated vaccine.\" While citing this source, Barton also criticized the CDC for its \"routine practice of reinterpreting evidence and misrepresenting the facts. This practice has continued for over 13 years. The public is entitled to accurate health and medical history information on any person who dies from a vaccine-related injury, and that does not appear to have occurred on this occasion.\" [3] [1]\n\nBarton's conclusions about the facts of Salk's death were supported by his statement. Dr. Frank Kornfeld of the Office of the Director of Public Health and Environmental Hazards of the CDC was asked by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to describe Salk's death. Kornfeld replied by stating that Salk died \"as a result of a severe allergic reaction\" to polio vaccines, including \"the DTaP vaccine.\" [1] [3]\n\nThe House committee also cited an investigative report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which asserted that Salk was killed by polio vaccine (i.e. he didn't die from a fatal vaccine reaction) and a report of the National Institutes of Health's Office of the Inspector General, which acknowledged that the NIH had \"lost all documentation for administering [Salk's] vaccine.\" The National Institutes of Health had \"lost\" a \"comprehensive medical file for all polio cases. This file was destroyed by the agency without any record being maintained of what did and did not remain relevant.\" [1] [3]\n\nOn 24 March 2006, Dr. Donald R. Thompson of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a sworn statement about Salk's death. [1] He reported that on 23 June 2005, an \"office of the chief health officer\" reviewed Salk's case file to ensure that Salk's medical history was complete. The report concluded that Salk did not die from a vaccine reaction; that \"no information pertaining to a vaccine related reaction was located and no further action was recommended\"; and that Salk's vaccine history was \"in conformity with prevailing evidence in the science literature regarding the safety of DTaP vaccine.\"[1]\n\nIn an 8 January 2007 letter to Congressman Barton, Salk's parents wrote: \"Dr. Thompson's report completely exonerates Dr. Salk of any vaccine-related damage caused by his polio vaccine.\" The letter also included a copy of Dr. Thompson's report, which had been provided by the NIH. [1] [3]\n\nIn 2004, Rambam Medical Center in Israel issued a statement about the death of its father, Dr. Yehuda Rambam. Rambam passed away of a heart attack on 15 December 1991. His death came one day just 15 days after he received Sabin's poliovirus-containing vaccine, the very same vaccine against vaccine-preventable disease that was associated with the death of the Salk siblings in 1955. The parents charged that Rambam's death was caused by a vaccine injury—not a vaccine reaction. Although he may not have been a health professional, Rambam's death also could have been prevented had doctors known about the \"very well documented\" vaccine-caused cardiac arrest and heart attack before administering the vaccination.

Why bother opening a movie if no one is watching it? Especially during a time when theatres are struggling and a movie like this would have been dead on arrival anyway.\n\nTo sum up, when you have two of the most recognizable and beloved fictional characters of all time being made out of a couple of guys who are considered professional wrestlers and a bunch of producers, you do your own thing. The result is a poor effort, at best.\n\n2. The Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nEven today there's still a lot of people who claim the infamous musical, the 1990 Disney \"sad, sad little movie about a girl and the man who saved her, is a masterpiece worthy of our admiration.\n\nHowever, just a very brief look at its Wikipedia article would reveal quite the opposite:\n\nThe Little Mermaid may be the most infamous of all Disney films made to promote a product and to promote Disney to its widest audience.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1991, the \"Mermaid\" became the longest running running number one selling Broadway musical in the world.\n\nThe songs were produced by the Disney subsidiary BGM Entertainment, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.\n\nWhile songs were credited to the songwriting teams of two individual writers, there is no proof whatsoever the musical was written by one person and directed by another, with the two people writing most of the songs coming under a single pseudonym.\n\nAccording to the Disney website The Little Mermaid won the Oscar of the best musical for its originality and outstanding achievement, which is actually somewhat misleading since only one \"Original Score\" of the 90 minutes production was nominated. A total of two songs, \"The Little Mermaid\", \"My Fair Lady\", were won for Best Original Song. Since only one of them was nominated though, the actual nominations for Best Original Score went to either The Carpenters or \"All Grown Up\" by the Temptations\n\nAccording to the website The Little Mermaid's theatrical history can be traced back to a few rehearsals and meetings on July 9 and 10 in 1984 with the director Michael Bublé and Michael Greif as musical partners. As for the musical's theme of mermaids, this theme has been used in the past in The Little Mermaid and \"Tangled\" by Hans Zimmer.\n\nIf we look further into how Michael Bublé (of The West Wing and Disney's Aladdin fame) became the director of \"The Little Mermaid\", that is really what the movie is about. As an actor and producer, he has produced many of Disney's highest profile, hit movies, such as Beauty and The Beast, Hercules, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Cinderella. Bublé and Greif had an idea, and decided to bring the Disney animation to life. In this way the two men ended up with the chance to make what some argue is the greatest musical of all time.\n\nSo who was the director, Michael Bublé? Michael Bublé was a relatively unknown Hollywood actor who had little film credits prior to his being cast in this movie, and even less after his being cast in The Little Mermaid. Bublé was born and raised in the United Kingdom and has spent much of his life living and working there.\n\n\"Bublé had been watching BGM Entertainment's productions for some time, and even as an avid fan, he knew he would be perfect in the director's chair. He had produced both BGM and Disney's Aladdin theatrically as well as television productions: he knew exactly what the studio wanted.\" —Michael Bublé, director of the Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nAfter starring in the musical The Wiz in 1984, he made a name for himself with the 1990 musical Little Miss Sunshine, which he directed. In 1994, he directed Disney's Aladdin, which was the highest grossing film in the world at that time. The following year, Bublé returned to the Disney fold with Aladdin, which was a modest box office success but failed to live up to its previous successes, and while Aladdin is considered a cult classic by most people, it ultimately failed to win critical praise or critical acclaim when it finally hit theaters.\n\nThe Little Mermaid became his first film to not win an Academy Award nomination, but the film was nominated for", "label": "gpt2"}

In the immediate aftermath of a severe gas explosion, however, this is often not the case and the gas may contain at least 5 percent carbon dioxide.\n\nMost severe cases of air-purifying lung syndrome have occurred in cars (and in the case of children, in a car seat), but the syndrome's effects can occur in other situations as well. Examples of these other situations include:\n\nGas-fired power plants or coal boilers and water treatment facilities, particularly when there is a high concentration of pollutants in the air, such as in industrial buildings.

{"text": "this review summarizes our present knowledge about elderly people's taste and related problems related to their aging. We will introduce the taste and oral function, taste-taste interrelationships, age-related changes in taste acuity, and changes in taste quality in relation with aging, and we will consider the implications of these findings for the improvement of oral health through taste intervention.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough it is commonly accepted as the most reliable way of assessing general health status in humans (Logan and Hirsch, 1989), the ability to accurately judge whether an individual is healthy, is well or suffering from a disease is a subject of much debate (see, for example, van Tongeren et al., 2012). The use of oral tests as a clinical tool is limited in this respect, perhaps due to two reasons: first, there is relatively low sensitivity in these tests, limiting sensitivity and specificity; second, due to the lack of a standardized definition of health, a single test or instrument cannot be used to accurately predict health status.\n\nThe main objective of this review is to introduce the concept of the 'health status' of an individual in terms of both their oral health, and the quality of their oral function. Although the majority of oral tests on 'health status' measures have been developed and tested in other populations, and although the general premise and underlying mechanisms of oral tests for estimating health status have been repeatedly used (e.g. Kallen and Schuster, 1992; Blaser et al., 2007), it is important that the review is informative for the oral health evaluation of the elderly. Previous reviews (e.g. Rabinowitz et al., 1992) have provided useful descriptive summaries of the results from previous studies on health and oral functioning, but our current understanding of the oral health profile of the elderly, as well as the implications of these findings for the evaluation and provision of oral health services to these populations, is primarily based on the results of limited number of population studies. Moreover, because an understanding of the relationship of oral health to overall health status, particularly to the level of the whole body health, is only now emerging, this review is designed not as a comprehensive review dealing with a range of topics related to health. Instead, the main aim of the present review is to highlight our current understanding of differences in oral health among older populations, and these findings are likely to inform the ongoing development and implementation of oral health interventions and programs to improve quality of oral function.\n\nSensitivity of oral examinations to changes in age\n\nSensitivity is defined as the ability of tests to reflect health status accurately at the population level, including differences among different populations. Many previous studies (e.g. Pohlmann and Fuhrer-Lehmann, 1995) have also shown that there will be age-related changes in the response to oral examination, that are not directly attributable to physical health and functional capabilities. These results support the notion that the 'health status' of individuals will change with age. However, it is important to note that it might be possible that these changes, particularly in terms of taste sensitivity, are more likely to reflect changes in the actual health status of the individual. Indeed, several reviews of different countries have noted the possibility of inaccurate estimation of health status due to changes in taste sensitivity in old age (for example, Mather and Gershon, 1994; Kallen et al., 2007, 2014). However, to this date, the extent of this variation in aging has not been systematically evaluated, and future studies are needed to more fully determine whether there is indeed a significant bias resulting from the changing ability of oral examinations to reflect the actual health status of older people.\n\nAge-related changes in taste sensitivity\n\nPrevious findings have shown that there are wide variation in the sensitivity to bitterness (Bakkelian et al., 2010; Wurtman and Schütz, 2005) and, importantly, a gradual change in sensitivity with increasing age (Bakkelian et al., 2010). The changes in taste sensitivity observed in older people have been considered due to a variety of different mechanisms, which may include changes in the sensory cells in the tongue (Gollub et al., 1999), modifications in the structure of the tongue (Bakkelian et al., 2010), changes in mucosal permeability (Nestler et al., 2009), or a combination of these. Recently, a study demonstrated that the difference in the sensitivity to bitter taste between subjects (aged 56–100 years) and middle-elderly persons (68–79 years) could be explained by different taste cell types in the tongue, and the differences were primarily due to alterations in the subgaleal folds (Kim and Schütz, 2012).\n\nRecent publications suggest that ageing may induce some changes in the ability of the tongue to taste bitter compounds. The ability of taste buds in the taste buds or palates of older individuals to identify bitter, but not sweet", "label": "gpt2"}

The total mass fraction in the form of relativistic scalar field, called the \"Lorentz effect\", is also derived and compared to previous results. Our result therefore directly implies the existence of a physical entity which has been previously unknown to science and provides the evidence of a theory that describes the entire matter-antimatter system, from the Big Bang as a mere infinitesimal point in time, all the way up to quarries that form the quantum realm at large distances.\n\n\"The results are extremely satisfying and prove the validity of the approach. While the LHC has been in operation for 12 years, the LHCb experiment was active for less than one week so far, but is expected to continue to produce huge amounts of data,\" Professor Stachel said. \"LHCb will be a valuable source of data in the future, of course much more data will have to be collected to achieve the statistical significance of the LHC, but that will be interesting as well.\"\n\nLHCb is a single-atom-thick single-crystal detector developed at CERN for the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.

This corresponds to the position-momentum system of the classic quantum harmonic oscillator—in this case, the quantum state with positive energy and zero momentum. In a 3-space-time, the particle's momentum may be negative, but negative velocity (v) is still an invariant state for particles. Since the particle's position-momentum system is linear, the energy E i in this situation is simply (1, 0, 0). In 3-space-time, this corresponds to a system state where (1, 0, 0) has negative energy and (0, 1, 0) has positive energy.

{"text": "the steady current induced by electromagnetic field in a 2d box, due to the gravitational field of the earth, creates a rotation.\n\nIn the \"Tunnel\" section, the \"1s\" signal has started a rotation around a point called the \"center\", causing the \"TUNECOIN\" to spin freely as the gravitational field is not significant enough to cause rotation around such points.\n\nThe \"ZERO's\" signal in the \"Tunnel\" section has caused the \"TUNECOIN\" to spin around the 'center', rotating it into a \"TUNECOIN\" state.\n\n\nThen, the \"0s\" signal from the other direction will cause the 0s signal on the TUNECOIN, causing it to rotate around the 'center' as well.\n\nAt this time, the 0v's will cause the \"TUNECOIN\" state to rotate around the '0v's.\n\n\nThe following pictures show the state of the TUNECOIN when the above 4 pulses have been sent using the above \"ZERO's\" signal.\n\n\nClick on these pictures to compare how it looks as a result of pulses being sent from each (or other) direction, when they were sent.\n\nClick to see further pictures\n\n\nThere are several reasons why it may work that the \"TUNECOIN\" will spin when it is sent from one direction. Some of them may be as an indication of this signal being caused by another pulse not being strong enough to cause rotation of the state.\n\nAs for the \"0s\" signal in the \"Tunnel\" section causing the \"TUNECOIN\" to spin around that same (0v) point, this signal only appears in the \"Tunnel\" section as the state gets closer to the \"2d box\", and a rotation occurs towards the \"0v's\" as it gets closer.\n\nThe \"0v's\" signal and rotation can always be explained by the gravitational field of the earth causing magnetic field changes on the part of the \"TUNECOIN\".\n\nWhen a magnetic field causes magnetic field shifts and magnetic field currents in certain places, their current induced in those places (if there are any) will be due to the shifting magnetic field, and not the earth.\n\nThis magnetic field shifting and current induced in the '0v's' causes the magnetic field inside the 'Tunnel' area to turn due to the current induced in that area.\n\nThe magnetic fields outside of '0v's', will be caused by the earth itself, causing earth currents to be induced on the part of the TUNECOIN which the earth rotates.\n\nThis rotation and magnetic current induced in the 'Tunnel' area is causing the 'Tunnel' area to rotate due to the gravity force.\n\n\nThe 4.21mhz 'Tunnel' section results in a large amount of magnetic field (i.e. 0f) coming from an area which is very far away, causing a magnetic current in the 1s' and '0s' part of the signal to make a strong magnetic field around the center of the box (at 0v) due to the magnetic field in the 1s' and '0s' part being strong enough to make that area move.\n\n\nWhen I sent pulses in these 2mhz boxes, I was quite fortunate in being able to take pictures.\n\nFor these pulses, the \"0v's\" signals were stronger that in the \"Tunnel\" section.\n\nIf the same signal had been used in the \"Tunnel\" section however, the \"ZEROS\" signals would have made the 1s' and '0s' parts of the signal get a strong magnetic field in the '1f' part of the 1s signal.\n\n\nAfter sending 3 pulses on each of these 2mhz channels (with the exact same timing) at the same time of day, the magnetic field inside the box was altered, and the magnetic field outside was altered on the part of the pulse that went out at that time, causing the magnetic field inside the box to turn due to the current in that area, as will be explained below.\n\nIf it is the magnetic field inside the box that causes the magnetic field outside, then (i) the magnetic field within the box can also cause the magnetic field outside of the box which will cause the magnetic fields inside of the '0v's', to turn due to the magnetic field inside of the '0v' causing it to have to be induced as magnetic field shifts, etc. This is what will be explained below.\n\nIf the magnetic field inside the box turns due to the signal on the '0v's, then this will make those magnetic fields outside the box turn due to the signal on the '0v's", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy, particularly in Japan. A massive solar power plant, the world's first commercial-scale, large-scale, low-energy-intensive photovoltaic system, began operating near Kyoto, Japan, in 2003. The plant can produce 14 megawatts (MW) of electricity, sufficient to power two million homes. While the industry has greatly improved in quality, efficiency, and safety, the market for solar panels remains relatively small. There are many problems with solar energy production, however, including a high upfront cost of purchasing solar panels as well as significant installation fees.\n\nSolar panels have the ability to collect and store sunlight that would otherwise be lost to the power grid when the sun has gone down. This ability provides a natural way to create energy at night, when the sun will not be shining. Solar energy technology has progressed significantly in the past decade. Today, photovoltaic solar panels can deliver more than 5,000 lumens of energy per square meter, and can generate electricity for over 60 hours without having to be connected to the grid.\n\nIn 2013, Japan decided to reduce the amount of energy provided by nuclear energy by five percent. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident occurred in March of 2011. Though it was a tragic event, and nuclear plants in Japan are still operating, it was not directly attributable to the earthquake and tsunami that hit the country.\n\nHowever, in the years that have followed, the nuclear industry has been trying to develop an alternate energy source to provide energy for a future when nuclear reactors may no longer be needed. To this end, and to aid the development of alternative sources of energy generation in Japan, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries began installing solar panels on the rooftops of its factories. The panels, produced by Samsung SDI, were designed to generate about one kilowatt of electricity for every square meter that they were installed.\n\nBy combining a natural source of energy, such as sunlight, with relatively low maintenance costs, the panels are able to increase the energy efficiency of the factories. This gives the factories more energy to use during the day and is a great way to reduce the amount of electricity provided by nuclear plants. The plants also operate in areas that are sometimes dark, such as nighttime, which allows them to use energy that would otherwise be wasted. Combined with the additional utility, the electricity generated by the solar panels is relatively inexpensive to produce and can easily be turned back into electricity when the sun is shining.\n\nThe plants are currently producing a maximum output of about 4 kWh per square meter a night. Though not able to produce enough electricity to completely power every area of the factories' rooftops every day, Japan is considering installing solar panels on the roofs of commercial buildings. This increase in energy production is great help to offset the reduction in nuclear energy production. In the future, Mitsubishi hopes to have commercial solar installations on a large scale throughout the country in order to increase the amount of energy that is produced.\n\nImage credit: Pexels", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "we use the concept of doorway states to solve the problem of how to define door-state equivalence. We define a set of door-states to be equivalence classes, say, and define them to be closed under the introduction of a sequence of inputs. This formulation is not the only possible definition: the sequence of inputs that is defined for a particular door-state is the sequence of sequences of inputs that has all of its inputs in this state.\n\nWhat we want is to define equivalence, but we also want to show that if we apply a sequence of inputs, say and, to in the state, then we have in equivalence for the resulting state. Equivalence is not really what we want to do: if we had we would never have found equivalence in our problem. The key to the paper — and what's neat — is that the door-state equivalence relation, we use as a tool, is not necessarily an equivalence relation that works in every case. The idea that a specific equivalence relation can be used as a tool to find door-state equivalence is called door-state equivalence induction.\n\nIn the previous section I said that one reason to find out what door-state equivalence is is that the definition we use may not work for all cases. That is, we may discover that we don't need to have any equivalence relation in order to define another equivalence relation. Equivalence is usually defined, in one of these cases, in order to discover where the equivalence relation happens to be defined.\n\nNow the idea of door-state equivalence induction is straightforward. We look at one of the sequence of inputs, say and. We then determine if it is the case that we have with the equivalence relation\n\nsuch that. Then we define the new equivalence relation\n\nand show that we have it. We then define the equivalence relation by\n\nand show that we have for all. Finally, we show that and.\n\nSo basically we start by identifying the sequence of inputs, and, say to see if this is the case. If there is a sequence of inputs, say and, we start with the definition and then look up the sequence of inputs. If we see that there is such a sequence, we know that and form a pair. Thus the definition we give is not really a door-state equivalence; we didn't actually use equivalence as a concept. We start by identifying every equivalence relation on this pair (in our case, since ). We then define in the other direction and show this is still the correct definition. That is, to be invariant, this formula should still hold. And then we define the equality in our target sequence of inputs and show this happens to be the expected result of applying this formula.\n\nThis is the basic idea of door-state equivalence induction. A lot of it is the same as the definition I used above. The big twist is that this time we don't have to know the definitions up front. We just take any equivalence relation, and any sequence of inputs, and define a door-state equivalence relation on them. The door-state equivalence relations thus form a large class of the equivalence relations known to be well defined.\n\nIn general, you could make a lot more use of doors when you look at equivalence relations, but doors have an important unique property about them. They're useful in determining if two sets are the same: if they're both in the same equivalence relation, then they're the same, and if they're not equal, they're not the same.\n\nIf we think of our problem as being to decide that each state in a given sequence of values is valid, doors are a handy tool in that case. In particular, we can look for equivalence relations between sequences of outputs and sequences of inputs all instantaneously.\n\nWe will soon get back to the more general idea of determining equivalence between two sets of objects in our domain, but for now we don't have to worry about that. For one thing, it's useful to think about things that are not sets in the way that we are using this concept to work. If you come from mathematics, you may be familiar with a concept called Cartesian product. In this case, if we start with some number of objects as objects in our domain (say a set ), then we can say that objects in form a Cartesian product—that's to say that there exists a non-empty subset of the set containing all objects. The concept of Cartesian product works in this case because there is a unique set of the form, and every set is, in a sense, a Cartesian product. In this case, we're saying that is a non-empty subset of.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the idea of a Cartesian product, I would advise you to read Introduction to Math to get the lowdown,", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "Prussic gas, a murderer donning a red clansman suit and a katana - in which he was accompanied by his partner, Kage - was on the verge of destroying Konoha during the Third Shinobi World War. He had a deep hatred of the Uchiha and had vowed to erase their name from the face of the earth. When the battle finally came, he betrayed the village and led his forces into battle, where he eventually met up with his former comrade and the two fought. To prevent the Uchiha from killing each other, Naruto was forced to kill Kage before he could kill Naruto.[8]\n\nWhile the battle raged on in the forest, Naruto learned of the existence of the Nine-Tails and his father Jiraiya's role in protecting the Sage of Six Paths from it. Jiraiya subsequently departed Konoha along with Sakura, as he believed the Uchiha Clan would never have taken the matter of the Nine-Tails and the Sage of Six Paths with the maturity necessary to do so, and the clan would be at their greatest danger in the fight against the enemy.\n\nNaruto later returned to the battlefield alongside the rest of the Five Kage and the villagers, where they were shocked to witness two teams from Konoha and Sunagakure fight the Nine-Tails together, in what would have been a joint attack if not for the interference of the newly awakened Sasuke Uchiha who came after the Nine-Tails to take it to him and free Tsunade. This gave Naruto the idea to seal the Nine-Tails inside the Tsuchigumo and hide the fact its seal had been breached within the jinchuuriki. He then proceeded to capture the beast along with Tsunade in order to keep them from harming the others and after Tsunade was safely out of the fight, the Ten-Tails was returned to its original seal to prevent others from using it, which also prevented the beast's body from regenerating.[9]\n\nUpon learning of his brother's death, the enraged Naruto started rampaging around the village, resulting in the village being put on lockdown. While the Kage and shinobi of the village were preparing for potential attacks from the enraged animal, a jinchuuriki appeared and proceeded to tear the Tsuchigumo apart. While Orochimaru, Kakuzu, and Hagoromo's teams and Sasuke's team arrived a short time later to help deal with the beast, Sasuke was quickly dispatched by Naruto in a flurry of blows. Sasuke escaped and attacked Orochimaru who had been alerted of the attack, before the beast re-stolen the Tsuchigumo. Naruto and his fellow Kage then sent out teams to search the village for Sasuke while they dealt with the Ten-Tails. Naruto decided to fight Sasuke by himself since Orochimaru and Hagoromo's groups were too strong to face all-at-once. Naruto's attempt to kill Sasuke in this battle failed, resulting in Sasuke having returned to the forest with the Ten-Tails and later attacking the village's villagers. Naruto was able to seal the beast into a giant tree to prevent it from regenerating.\n\nAfter the Ten-Tails was returned to the mountain where the village's main base was located, Naruto and Orochimaru met in person once again after Naruto sealed the Ten-Tails' chakra into it (this caused both the Ten-Tails and Konoha-nin to be trapped inside the Tree of Life due to Naruto not sealing it inside himself first).[10] Orochimaru later taught Naruto various genjutsu techniques in an attempt to use them to take the Ten-Tails and the Tree of Life away from Naruto. Though Naruto initially resisted his teaching, he eventually did so, though in the process learned that no matter how strong he was, he wouldn't be able to kill the Ten-Tails in his current state and would have to leave the Tsuchigumo alone to fight it for him. After learning that the Ten-Tails' power wasn't limited to the Tree of Life, Naruto decided to use the Ten-Tails' chakra to seal the Nine-Tails within himself.\n\nThis did not go according to plan. Using his Sharingan to peer through the Nine-Tails' left eye, Naruto learned that it used both the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and the Nine-Tails Demon Seal to seal the Nine-Tails inside Naruto's body and the seal grew outwards. When it reached its full size, Naruto was forced into a life-or-death struggle. The Nine-Tails began sucking the Nine-Tails Demon Seal from him, causing him to lose his memories. When that seal was completely exhausted, Naruto escaped from the Nine-Tails' grip, causing the Nine-Tails to be sealed away as this happened, trapping the beast.

She advised he did not need the money for drugs but this was something that made Gavin sad.\"\n\n-She told the inquest she believed some drug dealing had been going on in the area recently. When she contacted police she said she was told Gavin's past was unrelated. When further enquiry was made and Gavin was interviewed it turned out to be the other way round. She added: \"He had made references to drugs that he had started to get involved in at about the time we were speaking.\"\n\nThe jury heard evidence today that Gavin had recently moved out of home with his mother and stepfather. He went to live with his uncle at a house in Chester.\n\nThe inquest continues.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "The university experienced its share of student unrest during the '90s, and again after the September 11 attacks. But there's been less tension this fall that in the past, as the university has struggled to cope with the fallout from last year's student strike as well as the school's pending expansion.\n\nLast summer, some students wanted the school to drop a proposed football stadium and instead expand on-campus housing. After months of uncertainty, and after multiple attempts by the university to reach out to student organizations about a tentative plan that would have kept students close to campus and to football games, the student government voted to opt out of the proposed expansion, putting off the vote until after the football season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have also been allegations of bias with some of the school's programs, including the department of African-American studies and the school's center for African American studies. But it's not just these efforts around campus that student groups are pushing back on.\n\nStudent leaders who were a part of the coalition seeking greater campus equity are now in control of their student government at Stanford — and the coalition has been working to move into the executive offices. Stanford's president declined an interview with the News but released this statement in response to the student government's new position:\n\n\"The Stanford University community has made tremendous progress since 2008 when we first launched the efforts to address inequality on our campus,\" said Stanford President John Hennessy.\n\n\"We are the first university in the world to have a Student Wellness Center, and it's thanks in large part to the hard work of student leaders across the campus and a national commitment and grant from President Obama to start the work right away. We also now have a student Senate, a student-run body that includes five student organizations: the Board of Directors, the Board of Advisors, Campus Wellness, the Latino Student Association, and Student Council. That's great progress by everyone. … But many of the obstacles remain.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the News, student leaders and lawmakers have been putting together a plan to move forward on their campaign to eliminate pay gaps for women and workers without college degrees — a program they say would benefit the entire Stanford community — and addressing racism and bias. But the group is facing resistance on both sides as well:\n\n\"The group will likely face significant push-back from alumni and others because it stands in the way of some of the traditional goals of an academic community,\" [University Relations head Andrew] Hamilton said. \"What this does is it creates friction. And as I've tried to explain, the university is at its best when we build bridges on our campus rather than tear them down when we need to learn from one another. This is one small example of an ongoing effort to develop a more inclusive campus that is needed.\n\n\"I've tried to explain to students that we need to create an inclusive campus, one that reflects the diversity of Stanford that does not exclude anyone.\"\n\nIn November, the Stanford Student Government Association (SGA) agreed to meet with student leaders from around the country as part of a multiyear effort to address unequal opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This isn't an initiative unique to Stanford,\" [SGA Executive Secretary and co-founder Nick] Hamer said at the time. \"People across our nation realize it's just not good enough to have one or two programs, or even a handful. No one has the resources to address every inequity that comes up, so we can do better.\"\n\nThis is certainly not to say that these groups are uninterested in these efforts. The new members that will take over positions in the SGA are some of the students who led in the effort to create a student-run housing system. The group also continues to push for a student-controlled Senate, and a focus on race and gender in its meetings.\n\nBut this movement may face some additional complications along the way as more student leaders come onboard, given the pressure they'll now see to be responsive to these more prominent groups.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "1983's \"\"Frightmare\"\" is an odd little film. The director seems to be saying, \"My only mistake. I've made a bad film. But it will help me grow.\" What he could have said was, \"Well, it all worked out alright. The film will help bring me closer so that we'll work together better in the future.\" But that wouldn't seem much better. So the film doesn't have a strong message, but that doesn't matter. The film is a cult classic for what it was and is. And \"Frightmare\" is a classic horror film for what it is.\n\nWhat makes \"Frightmare\" such a \"classic\" is mostly the fact that it was directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, a \"cult classic\" for everything from his music to his vision (and his personal, twisted interpretation of things), and for every aspect of, well, everything, including that it stars Antonio Banderas as a cannibalistic vampire god. So it's hard at times to define \"classic\" and it's hard at times to define a horror film, especially one from the 1980s. \"If\" horror should be based around horror films that are \"classic,\" then by definition, most horror films, \"Classic Horror\" films, \"can't\" be \"classic.\" It's a pretty common misconception and one that continues to frustrate aspiring filmmakers in their attempts to make \"great\" horror films.\n\n\"Frightmare,\" despite its genre-shifting, disturbing and deeply-laced themes, is considered by many to be a very disturbing horror film, and there is a reason for this. Jodorowsky has written and directed some truly horrific films in his career, including \"The Great Dictator,\" \"El Topo,\" \"The Holy Mountain\" and that aforementioned \"Frightmare.\" So much so that the film is still regarded as an extremely disturbing and disturbing film. If you've ever watched it, you'll know why that is a very disturbing film.\n\nThe film's theme is actually fairly simple, but it is extremely effective. In the film, humans are being devoured by the very thing they are fighting against. In \"Frightmare\" humans are pitted against the creatures they have feared and feared: vampires. The vampires are intelligent, monstrous and have taken human form of human. By turning people into vampires, and turning humans into vampires, the vampires essentially have defeated them — so the humans are stuck as the mere husks they were to begin with. The film ends with the main character's friends and family watching him being carried off in a truck.\n\nSo \"Frightmare\" is a classic horror film in that it's a horror film. But it's also \"classic\" because of Jodorowsky's own use of horror as a metaphor in the film. As a film director, Jodorowsky is probably the most influential and the most effective \"Horror\" director in the 70's and 80's (yes, even better than Guillermo del Toro or the great Sam Raimi), including horror's development as an aesthetic/philosophy. \"Frightmare\" is a great example of this. The film doesn't have any particularly scary monsters, but by the end of the film, you can't help but be very scared because you've known that vampires are terrifying. It's so important for a filmmaker to do this.\n\nSo instead of taking advantage of classic horror stereotypes like monsters, monsters in the 1980's are more likely to be the \"monster\" of the piece, rather than the more conventional and more interesting monsters. And when filmmakers use classic horror clichés like ghosts or vampires, they are basically telling a very familiar and formulaic story, one that you've seen countless times. So you don't get to see anything new or innovative. That's how we see so many old films being made today, and the great \"Spooky Night of the Living Dead\" is a prime example. It actually takes the idea of a ghost or vampire a little deeper than how you would expect. There are no zombies, or even a human ghost here, and that's a really great choice on their part for \"Spooky Night of the Living Dead.\" They were using classic horror tropes exactly as they were intended — the idea of making a human human-shaped ghost.\n\nI mentioned earlier that Jodorowsky was responsible for the rise of \"Horror\" as an art form. So if you're thinking that you want to make a horror movie, and you want to make a film that scares you, then you should definitely consider reading his \"Art of Fear\" when it comes out this Autumn. I know we've been talking a lot about Alejandro Jodorowsky and \"Frightmare\" recently, but we actually want to talk about \"Tron Legacy\" more, so let's get to that.\n\nAfter completing \"Tron,\" which was a very personal and interesting film for both I", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "When I first saw this film around 6 months ago, I knew I had to share it – but I had no idea it was something special, and I did not believe it would turn into such a cult classic as it has (and is still to this day). I really felt bad because people were so dismissive of it, and I was so sure about my review, but you are the people to believe in me and let me know if I am wrong, so I was willing to put myself out there and be judged by the people who would really be able to pick apart the film based on my thoughts. So here it is, the definitive review of The Manchurian Candidate.\n\nIf it sounds like I really didn't like this film, I don't blame you. I really did not like it at all, and I'm sure it's because I was too skeptical about such a film after reading the first time, but I am really glad I finally watched it, because since then there have been other people who have made me want to spend even more time re-watching it, but the fact is that the new reviews I've seen on IMDb – like mine – are all saying really great things about the film, which just proves that it is one of those films that is truly unique. As I said when I first watched the film, it feels like Michael Haneke's The Squid and the Whale made to look as if it were shot with some of the same effects and music Haneke directed for the TV miniseries, and that's exactly what makes it even better, and makes it even more horrifying when you think about it. So while I'd normally say what did good, what made it good, I'm actually going to cover what I think the flaws were, and then say if I thought about it, well, maybe a few things here and there don't make a lot of sense or don't really give a lot of insight into the film, but I still feel like it's an excellent, terrifying, and chilling film that deserves its place on the world's greatest horror cinema list, because I know if it was the other way around, I could almost understand if people didn't want to sit and watch it, and I can honestly say I still don't, and I will never stop trying to see the film again and try to see it one more time. In fact, that's why I'm writing this blog right now. If you know anyone who enjoys, likes, or even just enjoys good films (or horror films, for that matter, because every movie needs to be able to stand on the top 100) you can't really fail them if you haven't seen The Manchurian Candidate, and even if you have, the more you know, the more you'll be able to pick out how it can scare, frighten, and delight you, because that's exactly what you think of from the film and what made it such a great, terrifying, and chilling film. That's why I'd dare say, if I were asked to rank the best, I think this would probably just be in the top 10 lists – because it's just so damn good!\n\nThe film is all about a man named David Clines (played by an absolutely insane Paul Newman), who is a doctor specializing in dealing with mental illness, which is his specialty (he is a psychiatrist, and it's one of the films defining aspects – one of the main villains, who happens to be mentally unstable himself, calls it the \"specialist in madness\"). He meets a young girl from a wealthy family named Helen, who is in an insane asylum (as everyone has to be in order to be taken there – this is the \"hospital\") and begins a serious affair with her (there is literally nothing in the film so insane that I haven't seen before) and when one of Clines' patients is brutally murdered, he goes on a rampage, which ends up causing serious consequences for him and, ultimately, for them both. The film goes into several, and I have to say some pretty wild, turns as it goes, and there's a few times where it goes so, so in the other direction I thought that it was a little disorienting that it was, despite all that is going on, a very traditional, thriller-type, psychological thriller with a little bit of horror thrown in (it takes place in the 70's before the era of the giallo, but still features supernatural and sexual overtones in the way that the gialli often do – and Clines is a very sexual character, so this is something that I don't think many people would have thought much about at the time, but it's all just a way of showing that the film doesn't really take itself very seriously).\n\nWhat you also want to know about the giallo is that they like to kill people off in the first third of the film, and the first half of", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "background : there is increasing interest in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) as a leading cause of cancer mortality and a significant burden on health systems. However, the relationship and etiology of the various populations is poorly understood. Since the hepatocellular carcinoma has been linked to the development of different cancers, we investigated the correlation between the incidence of HCC and plasma levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3.\n\nIn the present study, we investigated whether the plasma levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-2 are related to the risk of different cancers in populations with different risk factors. We evaluated whether different concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-2 correlate with the risk of different cancers, by using data for the United States and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II.\n\nWe also sought to examine whether the associations between IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and the risk of different cancers vary by histologic subtype. Two previous studies have investigated the association of IGF-I with different subtypes of liver cancer ( 4 – 6 ). However, they found little evidence of dose-dependent increases in risk. Furthermore, in a recent study of breast cancer risk, high levels of IGFBP-1 (which are thought to mediate the insulin-like effect of IGF-I) were only associated with ductal adenocarcinomas, not with follicular, mesothelioma, nor squamous cell carcinomas of the breast ( ).\n\nThe role of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in cancer progression is of increasing interest. Evidence from animal studies suggests that IGF-I can play a role in carcinogenesis in vivo and that higher insulin-like growth factor-I levels are associated with increased risk of certain types of cancers in humans. For example, mice bearing a human growth hormone receptor (GHRI) expression cassette show increased tumor growth and carcinogenesis due to their high basal growth rate and high expression of the receptor in tumors, suggesting that GH stimulates IGF-I secretion ( 1 – 4 ). Similarly, high basal IGF-I levels are observed in human colon and prostate cancer tissues and in normal tissue from patients with carcinoma of the colon or prostate ( 5, 6 ).\n\nA 2 (age) × 2 (sex) by 2 (cancer) × 3 (country of birth) analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc comparisons was performed to assess significant differences in associations between plasma IGF-I and IGFBP-3 with cancer risk. Differences were considered significant when P <.05. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc).\n\nWe examined associations between serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-2 and HCC incidence in various populations with different risk factors and histologic subtypes ( ) using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II (NHANES III). NHANES III was a representative cross-sectional survey that is administered by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of CDC.\n\nUsing stratified analyses adjusted for ethnicity (non-Hispanic black or Mexican-American; non-Hispanic white or other; non-Hispanic other or some other race), age, and sex, we adjusted for all confounders in order to minimize the effects of confounding variables and stratify for race/ethnicity. A priori, we conducted analyses stratified by sex and sex stratified by age in order to examine whether the effects of IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-2 differed between males and females. As a measure of relative risk of HCC, we also stratified by age stratified on sex and divided IGF-I and IGFBP-3 by age or, in NHANES III subjects with a follow-up time short enough to be less than 5 y, by the follow-up interval (ie, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, or longer), which did not confine the analysis to the oldest participants. With regard to cancer histologic subtype, we examined the risk of different histologic sub-types of HCC. We also examined associations between circulating insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and risk of various cancers.\n\nIn multivariate analyses with stratified data on sex, age, and race, in which the variables used to define cohorts (CY) could be categorized as following: age < 35 y; age 35–49 y; age 50–59 y; age ≥ 60 y; race/ethnicity < non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American; non-Hispanic white; Mexican-American; non-Hispanic some other race;some other race; some other race or non-Hispanic other (non-Hispanic other or some other race); age ≤ 25 y; age ≥ 25 y; sex <", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "we investigate experimental consequences of the postulate that fundamentally photon-based quantum devices would be impossible to construct at all,\" the researchers explained in their paper.\n\n\"We propose the possibility of using the principles of thermally induced quantum error correction on an atom-scale device—a proof that the thermodynamic system is sufficiently compatible with quantum interference. If our model is correct, it would represent fundamental quantum supremacy in which quantum errors are corrected via photon–photon interactions.\"\n\nThe research team's proposed experiment involved heating a beam of photons to an extremely hot point, so high that the light no longer behaved as a stream of particles. The beam was then used to cool and concentrate the photons, causing them to behave as a single quantum system. The hot beam then flowed into a small chamber within which an array of two-bit gates was placed. This array consisted of two gates and two photons, which were \"caught\" in an interlaced wave pattern of entangled states. The team then measured the differences between the two photon states based upon its interference pattern and found that, because the photons were coherently coupled, they could each exhibit two different atomic behaviors.\n\n\"The key insights we gained were that the difference in quantum states could be completely encoded in one photon, and that the two states could be measured simultaneously and unambiguously,\" Jha said.\n\n\"That gives us the possibility of measuring the two states together with the single one.\"\n\nWhile the experiment only simulated one quantum behavior, the researchers believe that it could be used in real life to test whether entanglement could be maintained at a single atomic level.\n\n\"If entanglement did not exist, we might never be able to test the second-generation Bell inequality,\" Jha said. \"But the reason it exists is that quantum fluctuations can be generated, as we have shown, in a very simple setting by a single photon. If we can make our approach scalable to higher atomic levels of control, we could prove that the second-generation Bell inequality is wrong and that entanglement still exists, something which would be impossible to prove under any other assumptions.\"\n\nThe Stanford researchers also suggested that their experiment could serve as a proof-of-concept of their proposed methodology for quantum error correction. By cooling the device, or by directly pumping out and then cooling the device—a process that could be done easily in a laboratory—the researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed experiment. After cooling the device, they found that the device did not act as \"a kind of waveguide that creates entanglement,\" but rather as a way to focus and concentrate the beam of photons, effectively reducing entanglement and resulting in a reduction of errors.\n\n\"If you cool it down, you get a much more coherent and localized system,\" Zagorodnyi said.\n\n\"The reason is that the photons are concentrated in a small zone and that density has a physical effect. We now imagine that the energy density is what causes the error. This idea holds great promise for quantum information processing that is based just on photons.\"\n\nExplore further: Theories of quantum physics explain why 'quantum coherence' isn't real\n\nMore information: \"Quantum error correction via cold lasers via coherence and entanglement,\" Science, science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi … 1126/science.aac8846", "label": "gpt2"}

After his initial three-round loss and then a win, he was given the opportunity by the judges to move back to the finals and fight Andre Berto. If he had won—which he did—the top prize would have been $50 million. He did in the end, and the result was a decision, which is why he says he won't speak to you again.\n\nI was watching the match and I heard him say to the judges, 'I'd like it, but I can't do it, even if I wanted to'. That was what people heard, but I didn't hear it.\n\nTyson's response when he was asked what it was like winning the fight was to say he couldn't speak to you. He told the judges that he couldn't even recognize his own voice, or the voice of the announcer when he was talking, and to \"shut the hell up.\"\n\nTyson also made the claim that the outcome of the fight had more to do with money than anything else, citing his \"stupid contract and stupid judges,\" and saying, \"My life was in my hand that night.\"\n\nBut what does \"stupid contract and stupid judges\" have to do with any of that?\n\nThis is what we know: He did not get his $50 million for beating Berto, even if we take into account the fact that HBO paid him $10 million from 2011-2011, according to The Ring. In any event, on March 4th, he did not get his $50 million even when he actually lost—which happened on the night of the March 12th show, when he was given three additional decisions.\n\nIn fact, Tyson said the following in an interview this week with The Wall Street Journal:\n\n\"When we do this interview... I don't even know if I'll be in the ring when he talks to those judges. I'm not even sure what I'd say.\"\n\nIn other words, Tyson just doesn't believe that the fight should have counted given that it was a trilogy fight where one man, once a former champion, was given three more decisions.\n\nIt was a big \"no-go.\"\n\nAccording to ESPN's Andy Katz, HBO has never apologized to Tyson for the show, despite the fact that the company had no control over what happened on the night. Furthermore, according to the ESPN investigation, \"HBO executives were deeply disappointed by the decision, telling them not only that the fight should not count, but that they would not be able to find a judge who felt like it did when they sent the first draft of the fight off to the judges.\"\n\nA fight that was supposed to sell for $50 million would not have sold.\n\nSo, now, what is it about this case that makes people care so much about what Tyson has to say, and not only about what he says?\n\nAs I wrote on March 4th, part of the reason that this case is so compelling is because it has so many players involved; all those who, prior to that night, made a number out of $1 million or more from the outcome of this fight, from people who were involved in this entire fight, with Showtime, from HBO, from judges, all the way down to the ringside security staff. They can bring a lot of money into play, and people do care about them.\n\nPeople, too, can get rich from the UFC. The first pay-per-view event of the UFC has topped the record of $400 million in revenue.\n\nAnd the UFC made $731 million from the first three PPV events of 2013, which are all on FOX.\n\nSo, is it just because he won? Is it just because he wasn't knocked out? Is it just because the judges thought he won by decision? Is it because, if that's all it was, it would all be easy to fix? It would have been so easy to fix, and the first problem would be the UFC has to pay all its employees. It has to pay all the judges. It has to pay the fighters. It has to pay for everything else.\n\nAnd that's on top of everything else.\n\nSo people want to win, because the UFC pays these people to win, and it keeps the UFC in business, and the UFC is worth something. So why do people want them to win, when the reason they want the promotion to succeed is because it makes them money?\n\nPeople want to watch them compete, because they are worth watching, and they do bring in a lot of money. So why do they want them to win, when the reason they want them to win is because they'll make them money?\n\nSo, is money really the only thing that matters? Is", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "Robert Altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book \"\"McCabe\"\" could be a possible candidate.\n\nThis movie was initially directed and written by Cary Grant (from his script for \"\"The Big Sleep\"\"\" - see below) and stars Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe, Richard Burton and Charles Browning. It was released in 1956 by Paramount, and in 1959 by the MGM studio. The original novel by L.P. Hartley (a sequel to the earlier film \"The Big Sleep\") was written by John Galt, and is set in the \"Seed of the South\" in the \"Wild West\". The main character is a young \"West Texas Ranger\", who leaves his frontier home to protect the women and girls in a town of the West. In addition to an emphasis on frontier life, the novel features an interesting moral: \"A man's responsibility is not to God, but to his kind.\"\n\nThe film was a major commercial and critical success, and won the \"Grand Prix\", the \"Best Director\" award, and numerous Academy Award nominations. Its success was due to its combination of action, western humor, and moralist themes. In 1959, it featured in a number of \"Best Westerns\" polls, but despite winning several awards - one of them, the Best Director award - the film didn't win. Many believe that its performance in the category of \"Best Westerns\" is largely due to this fact.\n\n\"McCabe\" is also the name of a John Wayne story, first published in 1925, and one of the best-known westerns, even though it has been somewhat overshadowed by his more popular \"Gone With the Wind (in some critics eyes at least)\". \"McCabe\" also features an excellent and powerful supporting performance from Ray Milland. It was first produced for the MGM network as a feature film, but didn't catch on. When it was re-done, it was released by the MGM studio in 1952. It was a commercial success, and was nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award nomination at the 55th annual Academy Awards. It was originally directed by Joseph H. Lewis (from a story by Roy Ward Baker) and stars Wayne in more than one role.\n\n\n\"The Big Sleep\" (1959) by William Randolph Hearst\n\n\"The Big Sleep\" is the first novel from legendary author William Randolph Hearst. Originally titled \"Big Sleep\", it was published in April 1954, by Scribner's, a division of the famous Doubleday publishing group. In this novel, Hearst depicts \"a small and troubled Western town\" in Texas, as an isolated young girl goes with her father to a cabin on the outskirts of town. This girl's father, a lawman named John Naylor (played by Jack Kilmer), is killed during a raid on a gang of bandits, and she becomes the \"new sheriff\" of the town. At first, she struggles to carry out her duties, but by this time the town is so isolated that the residents have built an imaginary world to themselves. They believe that all of what happens is in their minds, and a visitor from the outside world may disturb the peace of their town, or worse, kill them.\n\nThe story tells mainly of the life of a man - J. D. 'Doc' Holliday - a veteran lawman who is on the road to recovery from a serious injury he suffered on a horse-back raid against a band of Native Americans. He visits the town, but has little trouble finding his way. Things develop quite differently when a mysterious woman (played by Joan Crawford, who would be nominated for a Oscar for \"Hustle and Flow\") enters their lives, and they begin to share their thoughts about how to best protect their town. While the film was released in the United States by United Artists, it was distributed by Hearst, who felt that it deserved the prestige of a movie of its stature. There is also controversy as to whether the film was a genuine western, or a fake retelling from a stage play. (See \"\"The Kid Who Wasn't There\"'s trivia page for more details)\n\nThis film was actually released in the United States by Paramount (a subsidiary of Viacom) in 1959, but it was produced by United Artists after the success of \"\"The Big Sleep\". The screenplay was written by William A. Dietz, and starred Charles Laughton, who wouldn't win a better movie Oscar in his career (and has also died in a motorcycle accident before this film). Charles Laughton won an Oscar for this best supporting performance in a supporting role for his performance in \"\"The Sting\"\" (see below). The original Broadway production of \"\"The Big Sleep\"\" was directed by Robert Altman, and it featured an incredible cast including Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.\n\nIt has also been reported that the producers of this film felt that they couldn't get it made without John Wayne", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "superdeformed states in light @xmath0 nuclei are studied by means of an interferometer. In the same way that light waves are deflected by the surface of a mirror, nuclei on this surface may be deflected by the same interferometer. As long as the interferometer is kept at the right distance, no matter which nuclei are affected the same will happen to the image. The interference pattern between the nuclei and the light waves has been studied experimentally. The results of these experiments are given as follows:. When a nucleus is in the interferometer, the interaction between nuclei and the light waves tends to spread the light wave all over its angular direction. If a nucleus is in the interferometer, this means that the interaction tends to push the light waves towards the nucleus. From a mathematical point of view, the interaction between a nucleus and a light wave is called the local interaction. The two examples shown in the figure above show how the interaction between two single nuclei can influence the light waves and produce a changing image. Thus, a nucleus may act like an electronic \"screen\" and produce a uniform field on all directions with a slight bias of the fields. The fields can be described by the Lorentz transformation function of the interferometer. For example, the magnetic field of the nucleus A is written in terms of Lorentz, where A is an arbitrary magnetic nucleus in a certain state according to the theory. The local interaction (interference pattern) which is formed between a pair of nuclei is given by: and the energy levels of the wave functions are given by the following formula. So far, we found both the interaction and the energy levels. However, it is important to realise that the interaction does not mean that some forces are acting only in one direction but that all the forces can be described also in terms of the three terms: the local interaction, the field dependence and the Lorentz transformation. In terms of the Lorentz transformation function, we may also write the two terms: The results of this analysis are given by the following equations for the field dependence: Now, the energy levels are given as follows: and,, the field dependent on the state of the local interaction, the first term in the Lorentz transformation function, and the second term from the Lorentz transformation function. Note that the interaction between the two nuclei only influences the image in the one direction and that the field dependent functions is related to the local interaction between two nuclei. The figure shows that the interferometer produced an image with a bright spot due to the local interaction and an area of relatively small brightness in the other direction, due to the field dependent interaction. This is because the interaction (which we call \"weak\") between nuclei and the radiation field changes only the wave field of the light wave. This change of the wave field is called the \"weak field dependence\". And for this reason a strong interaction between nuclei is required for the weak interaction to be preserved. If there exists a strong interaction between the nuclei, you can see that the image is not produced. The interaction is called \"strong\" only if the two nuclei have the same spin state, and as we know, for two particles with the same spin, the angular momentum of the particle with higher spin is always greater than the angular momentum of the particle with lower spin, therefore a change in that angular momentum does not impact the state of the particle with higher spin. So if an image of a particle is produced by observing a particle with an enhanced spin state which is located on the nucleus, you can observe two different spots on the image. The first spot is due to the interaction between the particle with higher spin and the radiated radiation on that particle. This interaction may bring a \"tipping\" of the particle with higher spin. The state of the particle with higher spin can be seen as a local interaction and can be used for explaining the interaction between two particles or the interferometer and its results. The state of the particle with lower spin will have no effect on the state of the particle with higher spin, so no \"tipping\" will come from this interaction. For this reason, the state of that particle with lower spin will be not produce visible spot on the interferometer's image due to the weak interaction between the two particles.

{"text": "archetypal analysis represents each individual member of a set of groups by the average of the means of the groups. So the average of the mean between A and B is a measure of the distance between the populations of A and B. In the study of European populations this distance is known as the k-th distance (the k here is a common, and rather arbitrary, designation). This distance can be understood as a measure of the genetic distance between two populations.\n\nTo the extent that there is genetic distance between two populations then they are genetically distinct (though there might not be very much genetic difference, or a good deal of gene flow, between them). This is the basis for the term \"population structure\". To the extent that the means of a group are the same from one generation to the next then they are genetically homogenous (although some groups show some amount of genetic drift). This is known as assortative mating (which in this context is taken to imply some amount of genetic differences between groups). But whatever the genetic nature of a set of populations then there are genetic relationships among them, and these can be measured.\n\nThe population structure of an entire European population is known as genetic continuity or genetic identity. It is this which is the topic of debate. Although the genetic continuity of the entire European population should be approximately the same as that of any single European, in practice the genetic continuity of all groups within an entire population is not the same. Many individuals in one population might be from a separate group, or even more than one group, while a number of individuals in another population might belong to the same group as those in the previous population. This means that the genetic continuity of a population can sometimes be as much a matter of local geography as of the average genetics within the population.\n\nTwo populations, each with two parents, two siblings, and two grandparents, form a population with two common grandparents. So the genetic continuity of the two populations must also be four (two shared grandparents plus two common grandparents). This is known as the nth degree of linkage, or n-th degree of linkage, (n- for a normal symbol, which is n + 1). (All links will be given the symbol n- for convenience, although this number is sometimes abbreviated as n, and also commonly known as linkage number.)\n\nWhat is the probability of two populations with just two grandparents, two parents, two siblings, and two grandparents coming from the same genetic background, and thus sharing a common heritage? The probability is just 1 in 4, or 1/4.\n\nIn fact that might not be very encouraging for a geneticist hoping to identify populations that do have common genetic inheritance. Since the average genetic distance between the two populations is only about 2/3 there is a decent chance that all the populations will have two common parents, two common siblings, and two common grandparents. Yet this probability is much larger than the chances of all of the populations being from the same parent population. In other words, there is only a 4/3 probability that two generations of two populations will share the same genetic background.\n\nOf course, we can have a bit more fun with this number. What if we had no more than two mothers, two fathers, two brothers, and so on (so six generations)? If we had eight generations, and the average distance between any two members of one generation was 2/3, then the genetic continuity of all pairs of population pairs would be 2/3, or 4/3. But given that each pair has six generations, this might not be such a bad bargain.\n\nNow let us consider another case: three or four grandparents (so fifteen generations). This yields a probability of 2/3 that any pair of descendant pairs will share the same genetic background, making the common genetic heritage of all pairs of descendants pairs 3/3. But of the two pairs with three or four grandparents, there has got to be one that will carry the common genetic heritage of all the remaining members, so that the common genetic foundation is at least 8/2 (3 plus 3 plus3, or 8). So the probability that all of the descendants will have exactly the same genetic background per generation, not given above, is 2/2, or 3/2.\n\nTwo things are clear from the figures. Even though each generation has a probability of only 1/4 that it will be from the same parent population, there is a 1/2 chance that all descendants will have identical genetic backgrounds (assuming that they are all cousins) over the course of the two generations they encounter. It looks as if there is no genetic continuity between any Europeans. There is no \"shared genetic heritage\". Instead, there is a shared linguistic ancestry.\n\n\nThe question is whether this linguistic heritage is a strong enough connection to warrant calling the entire European population a single, genetically identifiable whole. The answer is yes! The historical question \"what languages are spoken in Europe?\" was formulated by two 19th-century philosophers", "label": "gpt2"}

It argues that it did not have information from the plaintiff, even with its full request, even because it says it did not respond to the notice at risk deadline. Moreover, it says, if the plaintiffs had made the request, government lawyers would have been required to disclose the plaintiff's identity. The government has not indicated how it will respond to the plaintiffs' request for the plaintiff's identity.\n\nLast April, the Supreme Court allowed an employee in a California Department of Water Resources (DWR) contract dispute to withdraw her claim, saying that even if she did not respond to the notice at risk deadline and the DWR had a full answer to her complaint, it was required by law to identify her. That case was brought by a former DWR employee alleging discrimination based on religion, which violates the federal Civil Rights Act, and which the DWR was required to investigate. Although in that case the plaintiff could have removed her complaint for insufficient information, the court said that did not take the government's refusal to respond to the notice at risk deadline into account. \"The Government has stated that it responded to the notice at risk request for reasons of its own,\" it said. \"The Supreme Court noted: When a private party asserts a right of its own, it does not thereby waive its right to pursue the other party to compel it to provide that right. A party whose request is denied because of lack of information is not deemed to waive the right to obtain that information.\" The government should also release the information, at some point, because the plaintiffs are not the only ones that will see the information.\n\nIn 2014, then-U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr argued in federal court in Utah, that the Justice Department has a duty to name witnesses in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits, as well. \"Plaintiffs have not claimed that Defendants waived any statutory or constitutional privilege in releasing the requested information,\" he wrote, but \"Defendants will now have to respond to the plaintiffs' discovery requests and provide sufficient details relating to the circumstances in which and the reason for Defendants' initial refusal to provide information.\"\n\nAs a part of a FOIA lawsuit, the plaintiffs will most likely ask for a subpoena to compel the government to release the name of the contractor, a contract, and the identity of the person responsible for the complaint. But it would be good to hear at this point the government's legal rationale for why it is now refusing to provide the names. In the last few years it has been pretty clear that the government does not enjoy privacy and is not required to protect the identities of its contractors or employees.

{"text": "PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - The owners of a Portland-area bakery said on Wednesday they would go to trial over accusations they refused to sell a wedding cake to a lesbian couple in 2012, only to learn they had been slapped with a $135,000 fine by the state agency that oversees business licenses.\n\nSame-sex weddings are legal in Oregon and Washington state, but not in Utah or Georgia.\n\n\"We're in court and we're doing our best to have a defense,\" said the owners' attorney David Cortman.\n\nTiffany and Rachel Bowman-Cryer were thrilled when they found out in March 2013 that Portland bakery Sweet Cakes by Melissa would be denying them a $135,000 wedding cake in 2012 because they were gay.\n\nAs part of its effort to force the owners to sell, a state licensing board slapped the business with a $135,000 fine, accusing it of telling a customer in a letter not to order their cake - because they were gay.\n\nThe lesbian couple's attorneys argued that they were defrauded by the business and that in the end they paid more for their original cake than the $100,000 fine was worth.\n\n\"They gave them a cake. They never ordered a cake,\" Cortman told Reuters. \"They made a decision not to buy a cake.\"\n\nWhen the bakery owners learned of the fine, they contacted police to turn over a statement they had given to the state licensing board saying they would not sell to anyone because of a wedding-related reason and were told by an attorney that it would be impossible to collect it.\n\nBut the licensing board had never asked for the statement, and the letter was never reviewed, the Bowman-Cryers contended.\n\nThe state, which originally filed the claim against the bakery in 2011, has a $40,000-a-day deadline to pay or it could file an appeal, said Jack Thompson, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Justice.\n\nThe state was due to begin depositions in the case this fall but would now start in September, he said.\n\nCortman said he expected a hearing after the court case, possibly for a few weeks, adding that he was looking forward to cross-examining witnesses like the bakery's former human resources manager.\n\nThe bakers could get the money out of the penalty in three installments, Cortman said, to avoid the burden of going to trial.\n\nWhile most people are accustomed to buying cakes that are a few dollars, the Bowman-Cryers' cake cost $105,000, said Matthew Patisnook, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union Northern California.\n\nIf the state were to prevail at trial, the bakers could collect about $60,000, Patisnook said.\n\nAn attorney for the bakers could not be reached for comment.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "class  i methanol masers are believed to be produced only after the reaction is completed (Sang et al. 2011). The temperature of methanol molarity depends on the pH value (Sang et al. 2011; Deutscher et al. 2011). To explain the formation rate, heat produced from reactions above the range of pH will be needed to melt the surface of the polymer, which is produced in a relatively low temperature. The concentration of methane is very low in the air because of decomposition of organic matter, making the generation of methanol easier. At least one report indicates that at least 10–10 times more methane is generated by the reaction of methanol at 200 °C compared to the reaction at normal temperature (Dey et al. 2003, D. Deutscher and E. Bailis, unpublished data; Deutscher 2005, Sang et al. 2011). The heat production depends strongly on the pH value. At low pH values of 5.7–5.8, methanol melts at 725 °C under normal temperature conditions, but at pH 5.8 the reaction proceeds at 700 °C only (Sang et al. 2011). At a pH of 5.8–5.10, the resulting mixture will be composed of methanol and methanol (2:2), a mixture known as 1:1, which can withstand the reaction of methanol at 700 °C for almost one hour. At higher pH values it is possible to extend the time from 12 to 24 hours (Sang et al. 2011). In this regard, the temperature of reactions at lower pH values should be higher (Sang et al. 2011).\n\nThe chemical reaction of methanol is characterized by the formation of methanol and methanol 2:1 because of the difference in the number of carbons of the side chain of the 2-oxo-hydroxybenzene ring. In other words, it can be seen that the acid group at the head of the ester bonds of methanol is more acid than the acid at the tail. The resulting gas will be converted back to methanol by the hydroxylation of the carboxylic acid. Therefore, the gas mixture containing the methanol will be more acidic than it was before the reaction on its surface. Consequently, the gas mixture with methanol (1:1) will be oxidized by a sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) reaction (Larsen et al. 1995), producing water and carbon dioxide (see Figure 1).\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of a sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) reaction. The oxygen is given by the carbon atoms, which are not present in the solution (green) when the SO 2 is oxidized to the sulfuric acid by water molecules. (1) The sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) is given off.\n\nThe concentration of methanol at the surface is strongly dependent on the pH value. When the pH is lower (5.6–5.8), about 80–90% of the gas mixture is water (Wästner and Blomberg 2010). The methanol (1:1) generated has a low mass concentration and the gas mix contains small amounts of carbon dioxide, the major component of the gas with methanol. Above a pH of 6.5 the gases are mixed even more, with around 80% water with a lower concentration of methanol. The water with low mass concentration (3:4) is of low concentrations (0.02%) and contains mostly water, carbon dioxide, and sulfuric acid (Dey et al. 2003, D. Deutscher and E. Bailis, unpublished data).\n\nIt is possible to explain the generation of methanol by the hydrolysis of a water-containing solution of 2C-H with oxygen. The reaction will proceed due to the action of the oxygenated alcohol. However, in our experiment (Dey et al. 2003, D. Deutscher and E. Bailis, unpublished data) hydrogen is not reduced during the oxidation. Instead, the reactants of the reaction must be removed from the system to prevent the formation of methane. However, hydrogen is not removed from the system, since it has a higher temperature than the oxygen in the sample. Consequently, it may be that at low temperatures and low pressure the hydrogen is converted to water. The hydrolysis of the alcohol creates two products; methanol, a simple alcohol that will be converted to methanol 2:1 and water. The CO 2 formed is not as important in the generation of 2H-cis ethylene as in the case of hydrogen. This is due to the greater heat release (12–24 hours) on the reaction at low pressure.\n\nAlthough both H 2 O and", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "human and mouse skin accumulate senescent cells in both the skin and in many organs. The number of senescent cells increases as more senescent cells accumulate. Senescent cell-like cells accumulate and become clumps of cellular debris. These clumps then accumulate in the skin and in many liver, heart, and lung tissue types. In humans, the number of senescent cells can be an indication of age-related disease because they occur in most tissues and often form the majority of senescent cells in the aging and dying tissues of the body.\n\nSome areas of the brain show senescence, that is, cell death, because they are over-populated with cells that will be dead in less than 5 years. These include the thalamus in the brain, the striatum in the spinal cord, the anterior cingulate area of the brain, and the occipital or outer-ear area of the brain.\n\nThe degree of senescence in a particular part of the body is a measure of the overall health of that particular organ. Senescence is increased in the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidney, and respiratory tract. Liver senescence is usually caused by cirrhosis that can result from the accumulation of fatty and oxidized substances. Liver senescence may also be caused by the action of viral infections such as hepatitis and cystic fibrosis. Gastric cancer occurs most often in patients with cirrhosis. The degree of liver senescence is a measure of the amount of chronic inflammation in the liver. Senescent cells accumulate in the liver with inflammation of the liver cells. The degree of liver senescence also is a measure of the length of time a person has been on a low-fat diet or on a medication that suppresses tissue inflammation.\n\nRenal dysfunction may be caused by many causes, including viral infections and the action of certain medications. Renal, or kidney, tissue undergoes senescence over time, but in the longer term this is most often due to damage being done by a bacterium, such as the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, or from excess production of acid-base mediators in the kidney that cause dehydration and a loss of sodium from the blood. Senescent cells can also be caused by the action of certain drugs, such as methotrexate, which can trigger a chronic low-level inflammatory response.\n\nAlzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia and progressive dementia, involves senescent cells. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of a cellular protein called beta amyloid. This protein is abnormal because it becomes oxidized as it accumulates. This leads to the formation of senile plaques and, eventually, to the development of the progressive dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nSensitive Sensitivities", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "Starting in the late 1950s, American computer scientist Paul Baran established the Baran-Walter principle that there are two basic ways to determine whether or not a complex system is stable. The first is to observe every possible outcome, which is called sequence analysis. A second way to do this is to look at the patterns of events over time. The two approaches are related because they provide two different points of view that may not overlap at all. Sequence analysis begins with all possible outcomes, but this gives a very loose definition of stability. Any outcome a computer can recognize as successful has already happened, and the sequence analysis method simply doesn't try to observe it.\n\nSequence analysis can reveal a system's stability if and only if a sequence of events, as it grows in complexity, starts to develop characteristics and routines that prevent the system from ever getting out of control or crashing. In other words, it takes a sequence of outcomes, looks for the behaviors or routines they give rise to and looks for what prevents them from occurring again. It then looks for a pattern or pattern of cause and effect in the sequence of events that will prevent both those outcomes and the systems that can cause those outcomes from happening again. A system that seems stable must be stable by either sequence analysis or by an observation of the patterns that can prevent it from ever becoming unstable.\n\nWhen we look at computer programs, the simplest examples are linear time or sequential programs that have a fixed internal state and return only an integer number of output arguments, i.e., if the output argument is larger than zero, the program calculates the number and outputs an integer. (The Java programming language uses a similar principle.) In this simple model, you must either stop a program (either with a debugger or the end-of-program condition) or else return the input and count the number of exceptions. This system becomes more unstable with time. First, it's easy to forget that exceptions are exceptions and not good values for input. Second, once you've stopped a program, the order of the inputs and outputs is no longer fixed. For example, if that program stops for a loop, then it stops for a while, then stops again, then repeats with an argument of different length. Even if you can predict everything that will happen, the order of events is unpredictable. When they run out of input arguments, you cannot look up a count to return at the end. Without further analysis, a computer has no idea when it has reached the end of the sequence and crashed.\n\nIt has taken programmers over the years many years of research to discover that an even more interesting system exists. This is what we call a random number generator, or rng. rng is a kind of computer algorithm that produces some number from arbitrary numbers given a time series of inputs, each input representing some condition in the time-series. A rng starts out in a state called the start state, whose only requirement is that the input numbers all have the same magnitude and same distribution as each other. To learn more about rngs, I recommend reading the classic paper by W. T. Mitchell, Random Riddles of Life, Random Riddles of Nature by Peter D. L. Johnson, and Robert E. Howard, Jr. (in English and in Arabic), all published in 1966. The rng algorithm itself is much easier in practice. Even a modest program can create a sequence of outcomes after a fraction of a second if your machine has a fast processor. (I will be demonstrating the algorithm in a very simple case later and explain how to create this sequence.)\n\nIf you have any questions about this, please email me at rng.program@gmail.com.\n\nIf you are using any pre-existing code from this article, please contact me at rng.program@gmail.com.", "label": "gpt2"}

These are just some suggestions; I can't offer the same level of expertise as to your tinnitus symptoms because of the lack of knowledge about such a life-altering and fascinating condition.\nIt is a really great idea to always have a list of all your equipment and medical knowledge at your disposal.  It can help immensely if you are able to ask friends, family, co-workers or strangers for advice.    \nLastly, it is important to remember that you truly can't control what sounds you hear; the only thing you can control is what you look for when you hear annoying noises.\nThat said, the tinnitus symptom you are most likely to hear is the buzzing in your ears.  Once you learn how to differentiate between the two, things will be easier.  For your tinnitus headaches, it may go as long as you want. This is not a problem. \nThis is a real problem.\nHere is a list of places you can look if you are having problems with other annoying sounds: \nI hope this has helped shed some light on this really interesting condition.\nIf you have been having trouble believing this, consider that some of the largest institutions with advanced audiology programs have tinnitus symptoms, as do most private and community audiology clinics.\nIf you find that there are times you believe you would benefit from treatment on the tinnitus front, I recommend having your doctor put your case on the table, so you can get an honest answer from them.  This really can be a life-altering experience for someone with tinnitus.\nTinnitus is a real problem.\nI believe that this article does a marvelous job at providing information on both tinnitus and tinnitus treatment options.\nAgain, these are two great conditions, both associated with sound that can cause hearing damage.  Tinnitus is extremely troublesome, and has severe implications for the treatment of high-risk patients in general.    \nIt is also important to understand that the tinnitus symptoms you are experiencing do not necessarily relate directly to tinnitus.  You may experience some, but not all, of these symptoms, and if you are experiencing a lot of them, it might be a sign that you want to talk about tinnitus with a hearing health specialist.    It can be a complex condition.  \nLastly, it is also very important that you understand that tinn", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "two questions that naturally arise in @xmath0-body simulations of stellar interactions:\n\n1. Are the two stars in different orbits around the black hole?\n\n2. Which are moving faster or slower than the rest of the galaxy?\n\nI'll give myself an edge by working a bit more in the \"X-Physics\" area. I find the orbital distances of the two stars and their velocities for themselves relatively easy to calculate:\n\nStar X is a K-type star at the center of a binary system – not quite a K-type star (you might call it a H-type star). I'll go with a K-type star. The speed of the black hole at the center of the binary system is v ~ 2.2 times that of all other galaxies. (Or, in this case, v/0.3.) The velocity of X is g. g ≈ v g, so it goes fast enough to travel to Earth in about a day – or about ten thousand days. The combined mean speed of all other galaxies is v ~ 8.4X (where X is a K-type solar system).\n\nIn any case, I've got the two stars at rest on the surface of a galaxy. They're in one plane:\n\nIf the two stars on opposite sides of the galaxy have the same mass, velocity, angular speed or other properties, the two systems can and should be able to interact:\n\nIf both stars move at the same velocity, they can interact with each other – and if one star does so more frequently, the other does so more rarely.\n\nIn this case the two stars should collide and merge. In that case the two stars can collide with each other and then the two stars could collide with each other; and then the two stars could collide again.\n\nThe gravitational forces in this case are pretty powerful – so if either star were really tiny (~9 solar masses) and the other star was more massive, the black hole would destroy the smaller star, not the larger star. The merger and/or annihilation of the two stars would cause the collapse of the galaxy. Because these two stars are moving in opposite directions, we can't see that the merger has happened – in fact it's much more likely that the two stars have collided and simply bounced off each other.\n\nIn this case:\n\nI'll give myself an edge by working in the \"N-Physics\" area. I'll figure out how to simulate a pair of stars that are not moving at their own separate speeds. But I figure it out. How will I know? Oh, I'll figure it out. No, I really won't. It'll be hard – I'll have to work in a special way that simulates how stars interact based on the velocity between the stars, and I'll work in another special way that simulates not just the size of the stars (e.g. the mass), but the mass of them, the color of the stars, and so on.\n\n(Note: In the \"N-Physics\" area, I'm going to assume that the two stars travel in circles around a black hole. I'll only consider the case where they are moving at the same velocity, for simplicity. This will make it possible to keep the assumption of a spherical black hole – I'll even use the same mathematical technique to move the stars. Of course, it is also possible to ignore this assumption and think of a black hole as a ball with a point inside, like in the movies.)\n\nSo, I'll work the problem for stars moving around inside a black hole. I won't simulate the star, the interaction between stars inside a black hole, or any interaction outside of a black hole. Again, it has to be done in a clever way that I find in the \"X-Physics\" area. I'll give myself an edge by trying to find a nice equation that simulates stars in a black hole moving about the black hole.\n\nOf course, this is an almost trivial problem – if I find an equation that is correct for me that describes stars in a black hole, I'll know there is a problem. For example, the speed the black hole can have depends on the mass of the black hole – not the speed, the size.\n\nAlso of interest is that this problem can be used to simulate interactions between stars that don't involve the black hole and the stars will not be moving around the black hole alone:\n\nI'll give myself an edge by studying and working on the \"K-Physics\" area – this is where I'll work with stars that are moving around the entire galaxy! But I'll work in a special way, that we will define later. I'll also give myself an edge by writing small programs that I'll compile to code that I can run on some microcontroller as a demo – this will be useful in getting some feedback for the", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "because of their universal nature, fano fluctuations are expected to be less severe than those predicted by classical general relativity. This makes them an excellent reference frame for understanding the evolution of the Universe.\n\nIt was first found in 1829 by Galileo Galilei, while he was aboard the \"Sailing Ball\", an 18-magnitude comet in search of its origin. It was discovered when a small ball of iron passing in front of the comet was observed to be deflected significantly, at least 1 degree, in its direction from the comet. Although the initial finding was not published, some subsequent work published in the Astrophysical Journal eventually gave it its modern name. While there was no evidence of a magnetic influence in the comet, a subsequent attempt by the British scientist James Ramsay at a correlation between the deflections of metal spheres in front of comets and their orbits showed a significant correlation.\n\nIn general relativity, the deflections of light caused by an object's gravitational field are converted to velocities and referred to a \"gravito-electromagnetic potential (GEMP)\", which is defined as:\n\n$$V = \\sqrt{ \\frac{8\\pi G}{3\\pi r^2} - v\\sqrt3 } $$\n\nwhere $g = (0, 1)$ is the gravitational constant, $r = r_0/4$ is the rotation rate in radians per minute, and $v$ is the velocity in meters per second squared. The GEMP increases as the sphere experiences more and more acceleration in its path.\n\nThe GEMP also governs the gravitational fields, for example Newton's gravitational constant and the Doppler Doppler shift is controlled by the g-factor (or g-shift) of the gravitational field.\n\nOn the other hand, in quantum mechanics there are quantised values that we can express in terms of an object's position but the GEMP is not affected by these mathematical quantities.\n\nThe two quantities $V$ and $a$ are usually written as the quantum quantities that describe the gravitational field in a direction that is perpendicular with the vector $v$.\n\nIn physics, the relativistic value of $V$ is often called the \"v-vector\". It is often written in an abbreviation such as $\\rho$, $\\rho$, or $R$.\n\nNote: the relativity equations differ from the classical ones, in the interpretation of light and other quantities. The classical version of the equations state that the position of an observer does not actually change due to the action of gravity (since time is conserved). However, in the relativistic version, the apparent position changes during the duration of an acceleration that could be felt by the object.\n\nSince the relativistic version does not change the time it is useful as a reference frame: the term \"time\" when used in physics is always \"relativistic time\".", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "The CDC states that the condition is not caused by the measles virus but by a virus called \"Mumps\" or \"Rubella.\" Mumps is present in an average of 20 percent of infants within seven days of birth; this virus has been the source of outbreaks of disease in the majority of developing countries. Measles is transmitted through the breath or tears of an infected person. Rubella infection can also be contracted from close contact with an infected person. The virus is most often transmitted to an infant when an infected person blows his or her nose onto a breast or other mucous membrane. According to CDC, around 6 in 200 babies born to mothers who test positive for rubella in pregnancy (and who are not vaccinated or have not followed the recommended schedule of vaccines) will die before their first birthday, while between 6 in 100 babies born to mothers who test negative have no adverse effects from rubella.\n\nWhy It's important to vaccinate\n\nChildren who get vaccination for any of the following causes can contract deadly diseases which can be easily spread to others through contaminated water, food, etc:\n\nDiabetes\n\nPneumonia/Suffering from a severe disease such as malaria\n\nLeukema Virus\n\nLupus\n\nDiabetes and diabetes-related conditions such as high blood pressure, low birth weight and metabolic syndrome\n\nLupus is usually caused by a virus called Rokitansky's Arthritis and causes rashes and other symptoms during adolescence.

Most cases and complications of mumps occur in adults and children in low-income and developing countries, many of whom have difficulty obtaining medical treatment or have limited access to healthcare.\n\nCases of vaccine-preventable diseases may occur in vaccinated persons who may develop symptoms of the disease and are not vaccinated since only approximately 88 percent of pertussis vaccine is given at the time of any illness. The remainder of the vaccine is given as an adjunct to standard immunization schedules before and after illness.\n\nWhy it's important to know\n\nThe most infectious person can infect other people through kissing, coughing or other simple contact. Even people who are not showing symptoms may spread the disease in the form of droplets from infected nose secretions.\n\nIf you are caring for a newborn, it is essential to identify infectious diseases such as measles as a newborn can shed infectious viruses in urine, saliva, and feces to other people, many of whom may not be fully vaccinated.\n\nThe disease can be spread to a newborn for a variety of reasons.\n\nMothers tend to be the main carriers of measles since the virus is present in breast milk and has not yet been fully cleared from the bloodstream of the mother. The viruses stay in the bloodstream of the infant even if the mother is vaccinated.\n\nIf your infant is not fully vaccinated, then it's extremely important that you do all you can to prevent the infection.\n\nThe vaccine for measles was introduced into national vaccination schedules for children born in 1971 due to concerns about the development of autism syndrome.", "label": "gpt2"}

I'm going to make a rule in this article as to how these things are treated. I'm specifically going to warn against using \"the\" for people who have more than one nick. I also reserve the right to warn against the usage of \"the\" or some variant thereof as a first name or nickname for an individual when more than one person has that name. If there's only one person with that name, then \"the\" can always be used as a personal nickname or first name.

A man got on with a list, but it included \"mangrove\" for trees or vegetation, and the phrase \"mangroves\" appeared in the title. That sparked the usage of \"mondo\", as the Portuguese for \"mangroves\", after which \"mangrove\" developed as \"mondo mungo\", which in turn gave rise to \"mangrove\". The word is still being used for trees in the tropical regions of the world, and in the world of maritime travel, where \"mangroves\" has long been a common travel phrase in port cities, even if the ocean waters are miles away. It may also, however, be the case that people have been using the word for a variety of other things for thousands of years, although the usage of the word in reference to this particular region may be as old as the word \"mangrove\". However the use of the word by the \"sports radio\" host may have started the trend that has come to define the usage of the word. The same is true for the \"Pitch Perfect\" film character. I can't see anyone who was watching the film or not watching the movie using the name \"Indy,\" just by the fact that people knew that it was the name of the person who was seen singing at the end of the movie, so \"Indy\" was a natural and easy word to use.

{"text": "I wrote last week that the ACC is currently on track to lose 12-16 games for the first time since its 1999 national championship run. I believe this is a fair assessment. The league as a whole is ailing and in the midst of a complete rebuild that has to begin from scratch; with the league's flagship school, Virginia, set to become independent in 2017 it's no wonder the conference can't seem to turn a profit in any one year. What can't be ignored is how far off from a championship shot the ACC is right now.\n\nThe league's flagship school, Virginia, is set to become an independent in 2017.\n\nA handful of teams have made the postseason two years running, but the majority doesn't at all. The ACC has won just 10 of its 14 conference championships since 1996 and its worst football season in over a decade. It has not won a conference title since 2007, hasn't finished a single season under.500 since the 1990s, and now is in the midst of its first six-loss season in 21 years. This is where we start to see where the gap falls between the ACC and national champions.\n\nThe ACC's future is looking pretty bleak.\n\nThat's why it's no surprise the conference is planning a massive overhaul. More than a hundred conference schools are expected to join as part of an overall expansion of the program.\n\nThe ACC isn't getting any younger, either. It is projected to lose at least 300 students in its current 10 schools over the course of the coming decade. This isn't exactly a pretty future for any fan, especially one like me who grew up with the league on one end of a national broadcast, hoping the ACC could one day contend for a title again.\n\nThe ACC is losing the ability to field a championship team in the next decade to other Power 5 conferences and other major football conferences, which means the league will be reduced to teams like Clemson trying to catch up at a slower pace.\n\nThis is a devastating blow to the league's fans. The ACC's fans have watched the league's most prominent program slip in quality for years. They've endured countless ACC Network commercials, ridiculous television ad campaigns, poor conference marketing choices, and a slew of non-conference opponents that would seem far removed from a conference championship.\n\nIf anything it just makes the league's demise that much easier to take.\n\n\"The reason I care about the ACC is because of those rivalries,\" said Mike Bowers, who is responsible for recruiting several Power Five prospects with the Virginia Cavaliers. \"I feel like the ACC's programs have really gotten out of sync and the ACC has really fallen behind.\"\n\nBowers has played many Power 5 football games with Virginia recruits, including former ACC coaches in Frank Beamer and Jim Harbaugh. They both told him it was tough making it out to practice at times, which leads to questions about the league's future.\n\n\"I think there are kids that were just really disappointed at the end of the day,\" Bowers said. \"The football conference has been so dormant. You know, a couple of years ago they got that ACC media rights deal on the table. They went on the road a couple of years ago. They've been on TV a few times. There's nothing there for the players that are recruiting in the ACC to think 'Oh, we can play this rival anymore.'\"\n\nBowers mentioned Alabama as a team that's seen the deepest decline within the SEC.\n\n\"When you see somebody like Alabama who was able to break out before it got to that point in the SEC maybe because of that rivalry, that's something that's still lacking,\" Bowers said. \"It's something that makes all the rest of us miss how it used to be; where they had that big title game. Where was that five-year period? Where were they when LSU was coming and Florida State was coming? When is there going to be a championship run? I tell people we just really don't think the ACC can make it.\"\n\nBowers also believes some current ACC players like he and other top recruits don't understand the caliber of talent in the league or the impact it can have.\n\n\"You see kids go there who probably were on teams that were just on the bubble early on, and they are probably thinking of the college as a bigger opportunity, and, in some cases, they're probably right,\" Bowers said. \"But once they get to college they realize that there are people that are going great, that are going to get to the highest level. They just don't see that outside of the ACC. I don't think it's about that.\"\n\nWith the league's television contracts ending soon in many major markets the next couple of years and a significant number of schools moving outside of the conference for the first time, the ACC is looking at a possible exodus of top talent.\n\nThat leaves coaches like Bowers", "label": "gpt2"}

We're getting older so I'd love it if I'm there on a personal level when they select their senior side.\"\n\nO'Driscoll has never won anything with Leinster but is convinced an Ireland win in Cardiff would make great theatre and he is hoping he can play a part in it.\n\n\"I'm hoping it happens, we haven't played well as a team on the big occasions, but you want to play well in these big games and get a win,\" he says.\n\n\"If it happens I'd be delighted to play in it. This is my country and if I can help a team play well for as long as possible then I don't see why we can't go one better than what we've done before.\n\n\"It's not every day you get a chance to play abroad and make a big difference to somebody's career. It's not just about a six-week tour when you can come and do another 100-mile weekend.\"\n\nIn the World Cup, Ireland face England in Cardiff next month, with that game followed in the autumn by a home game against Wales and against Samoa. Leinster are top of the table and have beaten England and Wales.\n\n\"It's one of the biggest tournaments for our country and for Leinster, too,\" says O'Driscoll.\n\n\"Any time you play the best teams in the world then the goal is to win, and that's exactly what we want to do in Cardiff.\n\n\"The way we have been playing of late – especially in the home games we've been winning – means we've not been conceding many, probably against the run of play.\n\n\"Any time you're playing your best, the players you have around you are going to add their own influence to the game. We've got a fantastic squad and everybody wants to improve their own situation. We are well-stocked in the backline with the likes of Tadhg Furlong (captain). We have five backs that are top-quality and I've got two players on the wing: Tom Court from Ulster and Donnacha Ryan from Connacht.\"\n\nO'Driscoll is also involved in his native town's famous St Patrick's Day parade which is a great night with all the city's Irish pubs lining the route and he hopes his team can emulate the Dubliners, who set an Ulster Lions record last year of 21 tries in a season by beating the British and Irish Lions.\n\n\"It'll be great to get out and have a drink in Dublin,\" he insists.\n\n\"I don't fancy going to a bar after the game if we lose, which has happened before in England. They are going to have one of those pubs that are all full when the game starts.\" O'Driscoll has never tried a Guinness, but his friends in Dublin tell him they will be very, very hard to stomach.", "label": "gpt2"}

Although only four SMC exoplanet candidates are reported in the present study, the full catalog could easily contain hundreds of such candidate stars. The short-period ejecta from the SMC could be part of a new type of planetary impactor: a super-asteroid or a fragment of a white dwarf. In the present study, we also investigate the effects of the short-period ejecta on the evolution of stars, as well as the distribution of this material on the interstellar disk; that is, we also investigate whether the mass and/or the impact ejecta of super-injectors have a strong influence on the early evolution of their host stars.

Most commonly, it has been associated with a blood infection caused by tapeworms, the council says. People in their 20s and 30s have been most affected, with up to one in 10 adults being infected. The council recommends immunisation up to 20 months after becoming infected, with the age of adulthood as a starting point. \"There's no good evidence suggesting people become 'immune' to this infection because you are already susceptible,\" the council's Michael Gillett said. The council would like people over 30 to be vaccinated for H. histolytica infection.\n\nH. histolytica has been around for millions of years, so there's nothing to fear from its spread, Dr Gillett said. \"It's the age of the person and the number of infections that should be considered,\" he said. Health authorities say there's no specific treatment for the bug, but it can be controlled with antibiotics and immunisations. However, they warn pregnant women and people who are HIV-positive, as well as HIV-infected people, must be alert to the possibility of H. histolytica infection. There is no immunity to the infection and once the bacteria reaches a child, it can progress with only a few symptoms. Dr Gillett said a lack of information on \"what to do if you are exposed\" and a lack of awareness of the risk of the virus made people feel \"neglected and unwell or unsure whether they could get infected\".

{"text": "we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova ( sno-1617 ) to identify the spectral signature of a high temperature shock wave associated with the explosion. These findings are in agreement with the theoretical prediction of the shock waves. We observe the main shock, a high-temperature helium-vacancy (HV) shock, of Sno-1617 in which most of the gas energy becomes converted into kinetic energy at high velocities and high temperatures. We also report observations of the shock wave propagating around the star before the explosion, which have previously never been considered in similar studies. Such high speed shock evolution of the gas is unique for a Sn/L type supernova and may be a consequence of the fast expansion of the host galaxy, which is not observed in many other SNs. This work is significant for improving the predictions of the shock wave in the upper part of the shock volume before and after the collision with the host galaxy.\n\nDOI:https://doi.org/10/1063/1568547\n\n© 2016 American Institute of Physics", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "objective stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen that causes sepsis in hospitals and nursing homes. We describe the first description of an in vitro isolate that can cause sepsis in humans by inducing a multifocal necrotic lesion, which was characterized as a necrotic stroma, a necrotic cavity (not a necrotic lymphoedema), and a necrotic septum at both ends of the lesion. The necrotic stroma contained inflammatory cells, including myeloid cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells, as well as lymphocytes, platelets, and leukocytes. Nesciati et al. proposed two hypotheses to explain this pathogenesis in humans, including the hypothesis that the necrotic stroma resulted from necrotic cell death caused by interleukins released by the septic lesion and cytokines released in response to LPS (7). The investigators proposed that the necrotic lesion would likely be associated with a large necrotic ulcer for the treatment of which it is critical to identify and isolate the causative agent. We described this isolate, which resulted in severe sepsis and fatal intravascular coagulation (8). The investigators and all others who have reported this phenomenon have interpreted this finding in the context of other, similar isolates including the Klebsiella pneumoniae O157:H7 isolates that have caused intravascular coagulation and septic shock (9–13). However, the fact that necrotic septum has been described using cell culture and noninvasive methods such as culture of urine samples has not been described prior to our study.\n\nMaterials and Methods We performed culture using the modified Kiehl's broth medium to distinguish between the three main types of bacterium, the most closely related to Klebsiella pneumoniae O157:H7 (Streptomyces aeruginosa, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae O157:H7). We performed all PCR procedures that were performed in the laboratories of our co-authors. All isolates had been identified from patients in our own hospitals or in local hospitals associated with Kaiser Permanente and Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. One of our coauthors from the Kaiser Permanente medical center participated in all samples obtained; all samples were handled by another coauthor, a microbiologist (C. C. C. K. and L. K. H.). Samples with the same type of bacterium or similar clinical history were separated by a molecular identification method (13). A consensus pathogenicity signature was obtained in each of these isolates (13). The isolates from the San Francisco General Medical Center were used as controls. Briefly, for each of our study isolates, the culture supernatant or culture-negative smears and supernatants were incubated with anti-SMSP-1 (A821) or anti-SMSP-2 (B821) IgG and anti-SMSP-1 IgG (in duplicate) or with the same type of bacterial antigens as SmaI-IgG, SmcI-IgG, SmcI-IIgG, SmcII-IgG, SmcII-IIgG, SmcII-IIhG, SmcII-IgH, SmcII-, Smc-, or SmcIII-IgG (in duplicate) (12) in the range of 1:200 to 1:800 for 1 h at 37 °C in a Lactobacillus brevis growth broth culture (Becton Dickinson). Cells in the growth medium were then incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-SMSP-I (A821) and SmaI-IgG (R&D Systems) (12) in the range of 1:100 to 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature in a Lactobacillus brevis growth broth culture (Becton Dickinson). The same SmaI-IgG or SmcI-IgG (in duplicate) was used as SmaI-IgH, SmcI-IIgH, SmcII-IIgg, SmcIIhG, SmcII-IgH (in duplicate) against the smears from 2 different patients. Each individual cell was then used in a second culture as a negative control, and in each case the bacterial growth-negative smears were also used as the standard and were followed by two separate SmaI-IgE andSmcI-IIe staining (to remove any possible contamination).

They are generally composed of air bubbles that result from the rapid influx of blood into the lungs during respiration. Although these air spaces do not contribute to blood pressure elevation, they may have an impact on the distribution of venous pressure in the lung parenchyma and on pulmonary pressure measurements. The formation of the plaques is not associated with any clinical signs or symptoms of shock.\n\nPeritoneal Abscess\n\nThe peritoneal cavity contains some of the most common body fluids involved in the blood-flow regulation. There is some evidence that some of these body fluid constituents may contribute to the blood-flow regulation of the lungs. Peritoneal abscesses are the noninfectious development of an abscess in the peritoneal cavity. The infection may be due to systemic infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, and chagas disease.\n\nOccasionally, a patient with a pulmonary peritoneal abscess develops a clinical syndrome characterized by fever, nausea / vomiting, abdominal pain, and the production of high levels of bilirubin which may present with cyanosis, tachycardia, a decrease in cardiac output, and a decrease in perfusion of platelets in the coronary arteries (hypovolemic vasospasm) and the carotid arteries (ischemic vasospasm ). However, a large proportion of such patients with acute hemorrhage do not develop significant clinical symptoms with the exception of peripheral neuropathy. The primary cause of the abscess is the infection with a pulmonary microorganism. This type of infection is uncommon but may occur after the formation of a pulmonary arteritis.\n\nPulmonary Abscesses are seen primarily as subepithelial lesions, which may cause extensive scarring of the peritoneum, ulceration of the internal abdominal wall, or other peritoneal neoplasia.\n\nLobular Acute Abscess\n\nAs previously described, a small (a few millimeters across at most), intravascular collection of blood within the pulmonary lobes, from which a large amount of blood accumulates, and which develops into a blood-flow-regulating peritubular abscess. Larger hemorrhagic abscesses occur in acute pyelonephritis; there may also be a secondary (necrotic) process.\n\nPericardial Epidemic\n\nA pulmonary hemorrhage that is a result of a pericardial effusion. The pericardium and the pleural cavity are involved.\n\nPeritoneal Abscess\n\nA small (a few millimeters across at most) intravascular collection of blood within the lungs, from which a large amount of blood accumulates, and which develops into a peritoneal perforation.\n\nPericardial Inflammatory Disease\n\nA chronic inflammatory process on the pericardium as a result of pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium.\n\nPeritubular Intussusception\n\nIn some patients with pulmonary vascular disease, a peritubular accumulation of inflammatory cells occurs in peritoneal fluid. It is composed of blood clots and non-dissociated inflammatory cells (erythoid epithelial cells). These cells have become associated with fluid and may be associated with a decreased perfusion.\n\nPeritubular Intussusception is characterized by: (1) the presence of pleural fluid, which can be thin or thick; (2) an abnormally large number of these inflammatory cells present in the pleural fluid; and (3) a decreased volume of the pleural fluid (due to the increased pleural filling). These fluid-associated cells are seen throughout the peritoneal cavity and have high molecular weight as a result of the fact that the cells are poorly attached to the endothelial cells.\n\nPulmonary Embolism\n\nPulmonary emboli arise from the rupture of small vessel walls in the lungs, usually during surgery. When the walls rupture, the pulmonary blood flow is interrupted and the vessel rupture spreads to the adjacent heart.\n\nEvaluating a patient for pulmonary embolism is usually made by obtaining a bronchoscopic exam to examine for edema, pneumothorax, and pulmonary edema.

{"text": "we propose a mechanism for the origin of the galactic habitable zone. The first stages involve massive stars evolving into red giants, which then evolve to brown dwarfs (1). The last stage involves stars evolving into a white dwarf, which either survives collapse or becomes a galaxy black hole (2).\n\nThe formation of the habitable zones for all types of stars are governed by the time scales of 2–15 Gyr (Fig. 1). The present epoch is known as the \"Big Bang\". A period of cosmic time lasting 2 Gyr is considered the \"transitional\" phase of the history of the universe, between the Big Bang and the present epoch. The Big Bang formed a universe that consisted of a single point of matter, a very hot, dense state. The \"inflation\" of the quantum fluctuations was completed in less than a billionth of a second (i.e., 1% of the age of the universe) (3, 4).\n\nAs stars evolved to become red giants, most evolved only slowly on the Earth. Red giants burn with an intensity that is comparable to that of a terrestrial star (5). The habitable zones of terrestrial stars can be found as points in a curve that is called the \"habitable zone of the stellar surface\", where the temperature of the star remains relatively constant [° C ; ° K, as in ° K; ° K = −1.0 + 1.0 x10−14 W m−2 (6)]. The habitable zone of the hot stellar surface varies more with brightness than it does with temperature (5). Here the planet Earth resides on the most \"hot\" part of the spectrum, at about 550–650 K (° C ). Most terrestrial exoplanets are even temperate, or slightly cooler. Our nearest exoplanet, Proxima Centauri Bb, is a white dwarf (8), and would be within its habitable zone by about 10–75 K; whereas super-Earthlike planets are typically rocky planets orbiting inside of their host stars' habitable zones, often in the \"habitable zenith\" or \"habitable extreme edge\".\n\nFig. 1. Period of life on Earth estimated as 1 Gyr.\n\nThe first Earth-sized exoplanet found in a habitable zone by radial velocity observations was GJ 436b in 2005 (7), but it was not discovered until 2010 (8). A total of 30 terrestrial exoplanets were found to be in this habitable area in 2015, two of which are potentially habitable (9). About 200 more exoplanet candidates can be considered to have a 50–75% chance of being in a habitable zone (10).\n\nThe main challenges of finding habitable exoplanets is to define the time scale of habitable zones. This is done by measuring their orbital periods in solar-system units (SUs). In the context of habitable exoplanets, there are three SUs (11), for each type of star, which vary in length of day and in the orbital period of the planet. The main advantage of SUs is that they are relatively simple to compute and can be used as a general time scale of habitable exoplanet orbits (see below).\n\nA habitable exoplanet is considered \"habitable\" if its total mass is below 0.8 au and its radius does not deviate from zero. (The planet surface temperature is then, in this case, given by h; where h is the actual temperature.) The habitable zone for habitable exoplanets is then defined by the average distance between the planet and its host star [d = d_1 + d_2 + ….d_r ]2.\n\nOne problem with SUs is that the size of the earth itself differs within a few per cent as the result of tidal heating (12). In other words, for every day the earth is the same size, it will have different diameters according to the radius of the earth, which would also differ with the orbital period of the planet and the planetary orbital elements.\n\nA new method of determining the orbital periods of habitable exoplanets is based on the stellar parallax. The stellar parallax is defined as: h = ∫ σ e sin ⁡ [ X i, t ] ( X i ) = h d i = h ( X i + X t ). (13) The stellar parallax can be used to calculate the time scale of the planets, as long as the stellar host element can be determined.\n\nThe solar mass and the stellar radius are known for a relatively large number of stars at present. For example, in 1987, HST data on 36 stars were available for comparison (14). This allowed the evaluation of stellar parallax for 34 of them. In 1997, this number was increased to 81 stars.

Earlier this month, Hawking warned of the consequences of the discovery of these strange objects, claiming black holes may not actually exist\n\nThis image of a possible supernova (in red) that could have occurred after a massive explosion in the centre of the Milky Way is superimposed onto a rendering of the cosmic microwave background\n\nThe astrophysicist explained that the only way for these 'unknown objects to form is if they orbit each other extremely close to where they formed'.\n\n'However, there is no reason to expect that such orbits should occur in real life,' according to Nasa.\n\n'Instead, we would expect to find more-closer orbits, where a black hole is much nearer the center of the galaxy than might be expected.'\n\nIf that were the case, 'it seems likely that such objects can be as energetic or even more energetic than the black holes that form in the cores of galaxies like our own'.\n\nAt present, the best way to detect these mysteries is through the development of more powerful telescopes to look at very dim and distant objects.\n\nSince a black hole's gravity is so strong, the gravitational waves (ripples like raindrops on a pond) it emits are so tiny'most of them are undetected without advanced telescopes'.\n\nAs such, astronomers are now studying the properties of a new infrared background created by collisions between two neutron stars that occurred 14.5 billion years ago.\n\nThis light is actually the leftover glow of intense radiation given off by the two black holes.\n\nHawking believes his theory could uncover the mysteries of how black holes formed, how they are born and why they go through cycles that could last decades.\n\nHe said: 'Our observations of the gravitational radiation that superluminal objects emit may help to tell us the true nature of black holes.'", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "a gibbs operator @xmath0 for a 2d lattice system with 6 components (@xmath1) and @xmath2. (You can see it on this plot of the plane, for example).\n\nThe key feature is that these expressions become \"linear maps\" in the sense that when you apply the operator to a point on the plane, the result is a linear transformation of that space. This \"linearity\" property was first introduced by (at about the same time as) Gabor Szabo (and later discovered by the logistic operators Gabor H. Nader and John Tukey), and is generally known as \"linearity\". It is a property which is needed to be able to map an image to an original image, in much the same way as being able to map a graph to itself, a point to itself, or a polynomial to itself.\n\nAnd the linearity property allows you to map the space into space:\n\nThis image is a \"vector\" of \"points\" @n1, @n2, @n3.\n\nOf course this isn't exactly what this image is supposed to represent. After all, it's all points to which a dot product applied to a unit vector corresponds. But the point itself is a linear transformation of the space. A linear transformation in this sense is, on its own, just another vector, represented by the linear operator:\n\nThe point's vector is represented by the linear operator as a line segment through the point:\n\nAnd this line segment represents the original image in space (in this case, the space of unit vectors @n1, @n2, @n3).\n\nIt's easy to see that every other part of the network – its nodes (@n1, @n1) and its edges (@n2) and such – are also vectors.\n\nIn fact, any linear transformation of this space can be written in the form of a linear operator on the basis of this space. However, the linear operator will be a matrix of size 4×4, and its element (a 1d vector) will not simply add to its component (a 2d vector): It will carry a value of 1 and must be multiplied by @0 to get it.\n\nNow that we're all familar with \"linearity\" we can make use with this to describe our network. The key idea is that every line segment within the network can be modeled as a linear transformation of its components: A point's vector as a linear operator through the point and its edge @n1 as a linear operator through the edge and @n1 as a linear operator through itself.\n\nNow that we've defined a point–edge–linear operator, the rest is easy: We just want to be able to sum over a 2d space the line segments created by those operators, and define a 1d matrix of size 4×4 with the sum as the input to the operator.\n\nFor example:\n\nAs you can see, each line segment is represented by a matrix which equals one element in the matrix:\n\nAnd then its element has the same value as:\n\nAnd of course this matrix has the same shape as a vector in the 1d space – a 1d vector with a 1 as the value:\n\nSo we can now say that those lines are points. Any line segment which is represented by a 1d vector in the 1d space is also represented by a @n1 point.\n\nWhat is \"an image\", anyway?\n\nThe image shown above is the original image \"as seen\" in the network. However, it is not an image in the linear sense: Because we're actually performing the network itself as the input to our linearizers, the output of that equation is a 2d image of the network.\n\nThe image above is the same picture as before, but in the 2d space of the linearizer. That 2d image shows what the network is seeing, when in fact our 2d image is just a collection of points.\n\nIn other words, our network is not an image in the linear sense, because it is not an input to a linearizer, and it is not an output because it is something that is visible by itself.\n\nHow is the linearization applied?\n\nWe define a linearized formula of width 1 in the dimension space of the network's components. The input component to the linearizer is our 2d matrix, and the output is a 2d matrix.\n\nGiven the 2d matrix @y(x) in dimension space — which is just the matrix @x(1) + @y(10) — and a constant vector @x(1) and a point @y(x), we are now able to find a linearization formula, which we apply to the 2d input from", "label": "gpt2"}

You should get a hypothyroid test every year at least until you are 45 years (older women can get a test as early as 25).\n\nIn the US, more than 1 million women have hypothyroidism. Most of these women have atypical disease. In some cases, the hormone and parathyroid glands are not working properly.\n\nHypothyroidism is common in women whose periods stop. In some cases, hypothyroidism is a sign of cancer as these patients are over treated with thyroid hormone and not enough thyroid growth.\n\nAccording to the WHO, around 10 to 15 per cent of women have severe hypothyroidism. According to the International Association of Thyroid Associations, about 2 to 4 per cent of patients will develop some type of thyroid problem which will need treatment. And, half of these patients also will develop hypothyroidism after treatment. They usually develop it during the early pregnancy and during pregnancy.\n\nHow can be treated this disease?\n\nThe main treatments for hypothyroidism are thyroid hormone therapy.\n\nTreatment may help a patient's thyroid gland to work normally. Other treatments may include medication that will alter the thyroid hormone and/or parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the body.\n\nTreatment is difficult when the treatment is not effective.\n\nAccording to the British Thyroid Association, if you are diagnosed with thyroid malfunction, you can receive hormone replacement therapy as per the instructions of your doctor. You can get a hormone replacement therapy if your doctor says you need to treat a problem with thyroid function and/or the blood circulation is affected.\n\nYou can get hormone replacement therapy from the patient.\n\nHormones like thyroxine, T4 and T3 must be given. But, you need to follow the dosage guidelines set by your doctor.\n\nThe dosage for taking hormonal therapy includes the amount of thyroid hormone ( T4 ) and/or the amount of thyroid hormone hormone replacement (T3).\n\nIt is also necessary to take a supplement that will replace any thyroid hormone that are missing.\n\nYou may need to take a medication if you also have hypothyroidism.\n\nMost patients with hypothyroidism will become hypothyroid after about 6 months. After two years, most patients with hypothyroidism will take medication in place of the natural thyroid hormone. Some patients with hypothyroidism will need to take thyroid hormone hormone Replacement medication even during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n\nThis medication will help treat an underactive thyroid gland and maintain proper health of the thyroid gland.\n\nYou have to have a prescription from your doctor before using any medication. Many women with hypothyroidism in India take hormonal therapy and go for treatment regularly.\n\nYour hypothyroidism may also affect your blood pressure. So, your blood pressure is carefully checked with a blood pressure monitor before your treatment begins.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, you must be told to do a test called Thyrotropin Stimulator Test (TSST). TSH can also be tested.\n\nIf there should be any irregularity to your blood test, you should have a call-up for a visit to your doctor to discuss you treatment options and get an accurate diagnosis.\n\nHypothyroidism may cause side effects like weight loss, fatigue, depression, low energy and weight gain during pregnancy.\n\nIf thyroid hormone deficiency occurs in the middle age and older women, it may affect their ability to get pregnant.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "had him pitted against a lone enemy, usually handicapped in some way, it could become a long battle of attrition, for instance. A quick-firing gun would be good if one was in the right place, but very effective if left to fly by itself, like a missile. It had a large firing arc (180°) and a very wide turning circle (4 km). This provided it with a lot of flexibility, so it could be programmed to engage any target with any amount of armor and at any angle.\n\nIt weighed 2.8 tons with a crew of only one and could reach a maximum speed of 36 km/h, which was the standard cruising speed of most tank destroyers at that time. However, the vehicle did not have a good armament and did not boast of better firepower than a medium tank. The tank was intended to be a \"tactical walker,\" capable of crossing long distances in a few minutes.\n\nIn June and July, the USSR put a couple of them into service, mainly for testing purposes. By mid-August, it was clear they were still being used in limited numbers. The Soviets also got several of these models, including a few prototypes.\n\nKV-1 was introduced to the Soviet Union in October of 1943, and entered production by 1945. The tank was designed by A.N. Yevgenyev, later the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of the Soviet Union and a former designer for the S-300 air defense system. Yevgenyev was tasked to design a vehicle to penetrate the armor of the Tiger I tank and the Panther III, so that the latter could be knocked out.\n\nAfter the project started, however, the problem the designers wanted to address was that the Tiger I and Panther were armed with the same 76.2 mm (3 in) main gun, which could penetrate the KV-1's frontal armor at almost 300 meters. Not only that, the armor thickness on the rear side of the turret was also as thick as the front.\n\nSoviet tanks are very heavily armed compared to their French counterpart, because the Russian military felt it necessary to be prepared for all possible situations. For example, the KwK 43 L/46 gun could fire both armour piercing rounds (AP shells, HEAT, even armor-piercing shrapnel rounds) or incendiary rounds. However, despite the fact that the Soviet military did not foresee anything like the armor of the Tiger I and Panther, they also still managed to fit the gun onto KV-1 tanks.\n\nDue to the increased weight of the hull armor of the KV-1, and the fact that the gun could only fire these high-explosive rounds, the design of the armor system of the tank had to change. To increase the protection of the tank, which was being built for armored warfare, the turret of the KV-1 was replaced with the improved version of the T-44 (known as the \"T-44B\") tank mantlet, equipped with an enlarged track skirt (called \"skis\") and a new glacis plate (known as \"panels\"). In addition, the turret ring of the tank was enlarged, as the tank's hull was not heavy enough to support such heavy weaponry. Therefore, the tank's front hull was armored, but its sides were not armored, to keep the machine guns from bouncing off of this new \"protected\" appearance. The armor was also more robust, to protect against shrapnel and AP rounds, and more resistant to armor piercing weapons.\n\nAfter the vehicle entered service, the KV-1's hull armor was not improved, but was improved upon. At the end of its service life, the KV-1 was still well protected but was not particularly fast. Its maximum speed was about 25 kph (15 mph).\n\nBecause of the KV-1's inability to penetrate the armor of the Panther tank, and the fact it did not have an anti-tank guided missile, this vehicle was not particularly effective in armored warfare. As a result, despite of the fact it was introduced in the late-war and its production was not greatly affected by the Kursk incident, the KV-1 in its production form was phased out by the beginning of the Vietnam War, and its use as a regular tank destroyer ended. Due to its extremely large production run, the KV-1 was also used extensively after the event, but since the vehicle was not fast enough to make up for the deficiencies, and the tanks of the time that could defeat the KV-1 (such as the T-80, later, the T-90 and the T-72) were already being fielded, the KV-1 ended its reign as a tank destroyer.\n\nSome early KV-1 tanks are also armed with a coaxial 7.62 mm (0.3 in) machine gun.

{"text": "A truly muddled incomprehensible mess. Most things in the film are so vague that the audience is supposed to guess or guess and then see the results. It's the sort of film which you'd almost have to spend days studying the DVD for for clues as to what might be happening. The script is also vague about so many things – sometimes a character gives you a line to listen out for and you'll see a character on the screen – and then the line changes in a single frame and you suddenly realise that's what's going on. It just doesn't work at all. There seems to be no thought as to how they're going to get anything done and yet when you watch it you see every single thing that they've planned and execute being broken, half-cut and completely failed. You see the whole team's dedication to a job being wiped out in an instant – or so it seems.\n\nThe story itself is that we live in a time – somewhere between a few years in the future - where everything is controlled by computer programs called AIs. Well, to be more precise, everything is controlled and monitored by these very \"AI\" – but, in the movie, it's made to sound like the whole thing is controlled by a computer that only thinks like a human. We are told constantly that the AIs \"work\" for a man called M (Oscar Isaac) who is our protagonist. There is no mention of any real person in this storyline. No one has to be real or make sense. No one is important or significant in the story or the movies in general. M is completely disconnected from humanity and everyone else. This also makes him an attractive figure at first – he does not have to work, has no social life and only has a dream job of tracking down a fugitive called Dr. Z, who was taken from us by AIs. This is a great character development – but it fails because nobody in the world cares about this guy, he just spends the whole time trying to track down Dr Z and no one cares. And this is all to bring up that a guy called Dr. Z had a girlfriend named Laura (Ruth Negga) who just happens to turn out to be Dr. Z's ex-lover. She was taken away but then turns up all over the place. She runs the AIs.\n\nThe idea is this. M is called in to investigate Laura's disappearance and also an apparent alien abduction in Scotland. He finds his missing colleague (Kiefer Sutherland) and his boss (Liam Neeson). At first, they appear to be a team – but then they tell him to give up and walk away because they don't need him anymore. And then he discovers that this was all part of some scheme (we have not seen the end of it) and finds himself investigating things for himself, rather than being manipulated by the government. He comes across an AIs \"headquarters\" in a mysterious place and there is a huge computer room with a bunch of computers – all of which are connected over the internet. All of this is controlled by Z. Then we finally meet Dr. Z and we see exactly what this all means in terms of the story. No-one is real, nobody is important, everyone is meaningless and is only going to get in the way or get what they want once the job is done. It's like a Disney movie with AIs and no one cares.\n\nThe movie spends a lot of time doing some kind of montage of different locations in between scenes that are just there to tell us everything is in motion, going on or running at the same time. There seems to be a purpose behind this – sometimes it's to show some kind of message for the audience but for some it might only seem like \"look at us, we're so busy on the internet we have forgotten to do anything at all\". But it does no more than that. The cinematography is amazing yet so lacking in style, creating a kind of boring film noir-like look. The music is equally as bad – at least it's not terrible – but there are some pretty terrible effects thrown into the mix that create a film that has no style to begin with.", "label": "gpt2"}

This is another optical effect, though; and can best be viewed by an observer positioned close to the pulsating field.\n\nThe rotation rate remains constant for a significant distance (more than ten miles) to the pulsating field. During this brief time it cannot be observed with conventional optical techniques.\n\nObservations\n\nThe field strength and rotation speed of the plasma can be measured either directly or by indirect techniques.\n\nBy direct means, the field strength and rotation speed of the plasma can be determined from observations of the pulsation of the plasma.\n\nThe direct determination of these parameters can be accomplished in the following manner:\n\n1. Set up a standard double-slit apparatus. A 1\" diameter by 4\" long Plexiglas tube, of uniform diameter as far as is practical, is to be placed in the center of the double-slit. In this apparatus, a bright (or pulsating) light tube may be used for the background. The tube may be placed in the center of the apparatus, or placed near one end and turned so that one end is pointing into the field of the pulsating plasma.\n\n2. At a time convenient to the experimenter, the distance to the pulsating field may be measured directly. When the distance to the field is measured, an observation must be made of the pulsing of the background light from within the tube.\n\nIt may be possible to determine the distance from the pulsating field using this method. However, this method should be used only if a very good background light is to be used.\n\n3. Observe the background light on an appropriate viewing screen; for example, a 60-inch flat screen will do. Measure the brightness of the luminance at the point of observation along a line of sight to the background light. The brightness of this luminance may then be directly compared with that in which the pulsing pulsed field intensity appears at the same place. The difference between the brightness measurements should appear constant over a length of the tube (or screen) of at least 1/2\".\n\nIf there is no pulsing, either the pulsing has no effect on the luminance at any place along the tube or the pulsing has been displaced from the tube.\n\n4. Calculate the value of the rotation speed\n\n5. Calculate the magnetic field strength at the moment of observation. This value must be known precisely\n\n6. Calculate the magnetization and radial magnetic field strength of pericyclic material with a minimum of instrument error.\n\n7. If this method is used, the value of magnetic field strength and rotation speed can now be determined.\n\n8. The magnetic field strength and rotation speed of the pericyclic material are proportional to the amount of magnetization in the plasma. Any rotation rate which results in a magnetic field magnitude less than the rotational velocity resulting from the rotational field density must be small.\n\nWhen rotating, the magnetic field intensity is directed to the center of the pericyclic material, where its field strength is diminished. There is a minimum of instrument error when the intensity of a pulsation is measured directly. This minimum error is approximately 2%.\n\nWhen rotating (or pulsing in the pericyclic material), the total rotation rate is equal to the rotation speed times the magnetization, and it is proportional to the magnetization. The total rotation rate is approximately twice the rotation speed, so the relative rotation speed also increases twice as the rotational velocity increases. The fraction of the total rotation rate due to magnetization therefore requires about half the total rotating speed to yield the ratio of the field strength to a certain specified value. This requirement is usually known or can be determined from observations of the pulsation or magnetization of the pericyclic material.\n\nIn the above experiments it is necessary to choose a size of tube of uniform diameter and thickness which will not be disturbed by", "label": "gpt2"}

Not only is it difficult to lose weight, but it can be incredibly difficult to gain it back.\n\nWhy is high-carb dieting dangerous?\n\nHigh-carb diets have been linked to the following conditions:\n\nMetabolic syndrome\n\nCardiometabolic syndrome -- a cluster of conditions that are linked with many other health conditions\n\nRisk of developing type II diabetes, an extremely serious and fatal disease; type II diabetes is an inability to make and use insulin properly\n\nLoss of bone mass, as well as a higher risk of fractures\n\nIncreased risk for cancer, including colon and breast cancer.\n\nIncreased risk for heart attack, stroke and stroke-related death\n\nLosing weight and losing weight fast has become another popular diet trend, but it is extremely difficult to follow for people who have high levels of carbohydrate in their diet.\n\nWhy shouldn't diabetes patients try a low-carb diet?\n\nEven though you would be doing yourself and your quality of life a favor by reducing your consumption of carbohydrates, dieting yourself back to a healthy body weight is almost impossible. High-carb diets can actually make you fatter, so you can see why some people believe they have to change their diet before they can lose more than a pound. They may think that you can get lean enough on a low-carb diet to be able to enjoy the benefits of weight loss without the risk of gaining weight back -- and so on. Unfortunately, low-carb diets are really no better than a \"normal\" diet of food packed full of the same carbohydrates in the same amounts. For that reason, patients with diabetes should not try to follow a \"low-carb diet\" unless they have a life-threatening condition like diabetes. It may be possible to lose weight on a low-carb diet with great success -- but only if you have already lost weight and are suffering serious complications.\n\nThe truth is, the only way to lose, get lean and stay healthy is to eat a variety of nutritious foods that are high in fat, fiber and protein, while avoiding the foods high in carbs.\n\nWhy low-carb diets don't work\n\nLow-carb diets have been associated with poor long-term results in studies by medical and nutritional scientists:\n\nPoor long-term results\n\nPeople who follow a low-carb diet lose weight slowly, but in the long term, they are more prone to developing diabetes and other complications. This is because a low-carb diet often contains foods high in carbs and low in unsaturated fat -- the type of fats that lower your risk of diabetes.\n\nPeople who follow a low-carb diet lose weight slowly, but in the long term, they are more prone to developing diabetes and other complications.

{"text": "In science, alumni include astronomers Carl Sagan, a prominent contributor to The Night Sky; Bill Nye, the well-known host \"Science Guy;\" and former Harvard president Larry Summers, who is now a senior fellow at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.\n\nThere is even a history within science to show that science is a very open and collaborative process. In his biography of Sagan, Lawrence Wright noted that Sagan and John von Neumann, another Nobel laureate in physics, went out for lunch in the late 1960s and \"discussed the possibility of co-operating on a series of landmark projects for humankind.\"\n\nIn the last few years of Sagan's life, he appeared onstage with Bill Nye \"the Science Guy\" in an ad for \"Science 2.0.\"\n\nBut as Science World noted in a 2014 article, The Scientific Consequences of 'Sagan's Death':\n\n\"After the death of his friend and mentor, Carl Sagan wrote Science 2.0, which was published in July 2015. The authors of the book had planned an anniversary event where John Gribbin – the co-author of Sagan's book Pale Blue Dot, and who co-authored Cosmos – would present \"Sagan the First\" lecture about a new, 20 to 30 minute version of the book, this time co-authored by Sagan and his daughter Ann Druyan.\"\n\nSagan also wrote an essay for the 2014 book, The Case for Mars:\n\n\"If my memory serves me well from my previous visits, we went into the dining room to discuss what might be the most important reason we should send humans to Mars – the preservation of our species.\"\n\nSagan also wrote a piece for Esquire in which he called the Apollo 11 moon landing \"a very powerful moment in history,\" and added its importance to a list of \"the greatest achievements in human history.\"\n\n\"There are many things about the moon that we know today because of Apollo, and yet, we have learned absolutely nothing about the origins of the solar system, or the origin of life – or the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe,\" wrote Sagan \"The most difficult thing about the Apollo mission was that it seemed to make no sense to anyone but us.\"\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Scientific American, Sagan described how, in his mind, the moon walked, \"and that it just stood there for weeks, and you just thought, This can't be … you have to have some kind of explanation for that. …\n\n\"And to me, the idea that it could have been made, by some sort of natural process, more than five decades ago, so long after the fact… It seemed preposterous to me.\"\n\nHe continued on the podcast the following year, discussing Apollo 11, \"that there were a tremendous number of questions left unanswered. … And with the loss of Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins [before the men set foot on the moon], [it] seemed to me perhaps we weren't going to have an answer. Neil had been such a tremendous hero – the greatest hero in my mind – even to someone like me, who'd been brought up as a science fiction kid. So when I heard that Neil Armstrong had died, I felt sick to my stomach.\"\n\nAccording to a 2014 Forbes piece on his retirement, Sagan \"didn't see his role as being an evangelist for science. He saw it as putting science into practice.\"\n\n\"The most interesting aspect of Carl Sagan's legacy,\" write Forbes, is that \"so many people don't realize he was so deeply invested in the cause; he worked on space programs in many countries; he served as NASA's director of planetary studies; and he wrote books devoted to space exploration.\"\n\n\"In the coming years, Sagan will likely be regarded as an icon of science but even before his passing, he was one of the greatest and most significant scientists of his generation,\" adds Forbes.\n\n\"Though we can't know how much he would have achieved had he lived, he was clearly passionate about science, its causes, and his role in its continued expansion,\" the article states.\n\nSagan was honored with an honorary doctorate of humanities from Princeton University in 2005.\n\n\"For the next decade or so, his memory will live in science, especially in those parts that were fortunate to benefit from his scientific gifts,\" according to the commencement speech the director of the Institute For Advanced Study gave in New York at the time.\n\nThough he left behind a massive body of work, many of his works have had value for decades to come. According to the website Encyclopedia Britannica, Sagan's two books on astronomy \"have a long literary history, as well as a continuing influence as teaching aids, and also serve as a valuable reference, and a great example of the use of graphic symbols in literature and media.", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "kaposi sarcoma ( ks ) is the most frequent aids in this diagnosis. But the disease also shows other effects, including the skin enlargement (bony spurring) and the enlargement and enlargement of the bones (called osteophytic osteosclerosis). These complications are known to occur with sarcoma metastasis, but rarely because it is often impossible to establish a direct path from the tumor to tissues. However, the disease often results in a condition called bone metastasis (bone metastasis) where the tumor has spread to the bone. In other words, the tumor has infiltrated the bone before spreading to adjacent tissues.\n\nIn sarcoma, the primary tumor forms in the soft tissue around the bone. These secondary diseases of the bones are referred to as osteochondritis dissecans (ODS) and soft tissue sarcoma (SSS). ODS is a disease of the bone that occurs when the bone contains a large amount of cancerous cells that can form many different sites throughout the body. Other characteristics of ODS are osteoarthritis, which causes pain or swelling of the joint when the pressure on the joint increases, or osteomyelitis which is inflammation of the bone tissue and has no pain. Most ODS patients that show weakness of the shoulder do not have pain or signs of bone tumors as an indicator of the disease.\n\nSSS happens when the bones of the arm or leg contain a group of small blood vessels. These vessels, when filled, cause the pain and swelling that many people experience in such joint conditions of the hand or foot. Some people may also experience stiffness in the arm or leg in addition to pain and swelling in these conditions.\n\nTo determine if you have the disease, it's important to know the location and extent of the disease. However, when a sarcoma is present in the bone, especially a soft tissue sarcoma, it's very possible to miss it without even looking for the disease. The best indicator of bone disease is when there is pain in various parts of the body when someone stretches the skin of the affected area. If this is difficult to accomplish or painful, that's a good indication of the disease.\n\nOnce this type of problem is diagnosed, the type of treatment chosen should be based primarily on the type of disease it is. If it's the primary tumor, the tumor needs to be removed, with pain control and possible surgical treatment given to relieve this pain. If it's a secondary disease of the bones, it needs to be treated if possible.\n\nWhen symptoms are constant, a condition called secondary osteomyelitis of the arm or leg may be diagnosed from observation. If the swelling is less and pain is less often, this may indicate a secondary osteomyelitis, where the tumor hasn't been removed and the symptoms are caused by the osteomyelitis, which might be a complication of the tumor.\n\nDepending on the type of tumor, different forms of treatment may be needed. Patients with ODS and/or SSS should be carefully monitored while the bone is being treated. It's important to monitor to make sure they don't develop another bone tumor, which is possible if the condition continues. The best way to avoid that is to get regular x-rays. And it is important to treat them as soon as possible to monitor and reduce the progression of the disease.", "label": "gpt2"}

It was not always like this, however. In the early days of the Cellino era, when the club was being run with a small, tight-knit squad of players, they developed a reputation for nurturing, developing and playing attractive football on the continent.\n\nUnfortunately for Parma fans, it has become apparent that a similar approach is not working now, with the lack of experienced talent being the biggest issue at the club and having been a factor in their relegation from Serie B in 2006/07 and the early exit from the Premiership the following season.\n\nWhilst there are many talented young players in the Parma academy, we're hoping that an astute recruitment drive can now turn towards bringing in some older, more distinguished, international stars who can contribute to the club continuing their good form and regain some of the national pride that they've lost in recent seasons.\n\nWe also hope that as a group, the fans are looking forward to seeing a club back to winning ways in 2016/17!\n\nSincerely,\n\nLiam Brady", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "as often stated, a class of @xmath0 gravity models which rely strongly on the underlying physics of subatomic particles, and their effects on the universe at large, that they are quite different in form from other physics models. These include M-theory-based or nonabelian gravitation models in which the quantum interactions between matter, energy, and gravity, and the quantum field theory of the atom are incorporated into their equations, or the supersymmetric models in which all of the laws of physics are combined to yield a new \"superpartner\", or the string theory models in which the fabric of space and time itself is warped to produce the effect of gravity. There is, of course, no single \"best\" model of the universal or fundamental forces; but in general, this is a class of gravity models that are well suited to describing the underlying physics of subatomic particles.\n\nNote that, even in general, the laws of physics are more than just mathematical constructs; they vary significantly from one discipline to another. In physics, the \"laws of physics\" are not laws of physics, rather they are abstractions or abstract mathematical structures. One might think of them as abstract principles, rather than as actual \"laws\", for example as the \"laws of gravitation\" or the \"laws of motion\" are not the actual physical laws of physics but rather as abstract mathematical structures that have been \"established\" as the physical laws for certain fields of study, or as in the case of the laws of thermodynamics, not the actual laws but rather as the axioms of a theory that, at present, there are no testable predictions for (even with the use of many different experiments).\n\nA strong analogy is of course the laws of logic, not being formally \"laws\", but a system of rules or predicates that can be understood and justified in terms of a higher level (or \"theory\"), similar in some ways to the laws of physics. (Also, unlike the laws of physics, those in logic are not always directly provable by observation or experimentation - for example in logic, we don't generally have a formal proof of \"x is a sentence\", which is only true until proof-taking is performed, and then it becomes less true). Another way to think of logic is, rather, as a deductive method (although in the case of logic, a deductive method is by nature more complex and sophisticated than the natural deductive process that underlies a similar natural language method, which is more primitive in its fundamental laws - for example in logic, the notion of a conjunction is more fundamental than that of a negation, and may be used more to interpret evidence than to form a new hypothesis about the underlying universe). Note that the laws of logic are simply rules and methods that can be applied to make a prediction about a piece of evidence which follows the rules (and the rules are themselves based on certain higher-level logical axioms, such as that all logical propositions may only be true when they are both true and false, etc.).\n\nGeneral relativity describes gravity as the curvature of space-time, and the cosmological constant is essentially the \"dynamical constant\" of the field of physics (the theory of the \"Habersham Durchmusterung\" or \"Higgs field\"), with more mathematical precision than the field of physics, where the field of physics is usually defined by a \"natural number\" - this is known as \"the fundamental field\". For example, if we divide the fundamental field into its \"weak force\" and \"strong force\" components, one will see that we get the field of motion which, in terms of fundamental physics, has two fundamental components - the electromagnetic force, which is a fundamental component of electromagnetism, and the gravitational force, which is a fundamental component of gravitation.\n\nGeneral relativity describes gravity as \"cosmological constant\", which has little or no physical significance beyond the idea that \"cosmological constant\" is a valid mathematical mathematical name which includes, for example, some \"real numbers\" of some kind, and that we can treat them like any other numbers. This idea had become mainstream in modern physics, although many modern physicists doubt whether it is valid for real-world parameters, for example the values of the other parameters in relativity theory. This concept of the \"cosmological constant\" is also used to characterize other parameters in relativity such as the speed of light in spacetime, or to compare them (for example, in relativity theory, the speed of light, a parameter that affects both motion and gravity, is different from the speed of a galaxy [see also A Note on General Relativity's Speed of Galaxies).\n\nFor more details about the cosmological constant, see Cosmology of the Cosmos or the Cosmology Wikipedia article.", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "If you liked William Hickey in \"\"Prizzi's Honor\"\", he resurrects his \"Big Show\" persona in \"\"The Big Show\"\". He has the same persona he had in \"\"Stuntman\",\" which is about the worst \"superhero\" ever produced. He can't actually dance and can't sing, but just tries to make up for it by being huge and musclebound and having all the same superpowers. The \"Big Show\" is just an imitation of Hulk Hogan, who is obviously a fan of these types over at the WWE. But Big Show doesn't even have the chops for that. This version of Big Show is just a big, weak weak guy who takes out anybody he can. When he does this it is always in a stupid comedy skit, like the \"The World Tour\". The episode does however have some real star power, with \"The Rock\" as his manager, \"Kanye West\" as his trainer and he does play a song by Michael Jackson (not the official music but a song from a Jackson songbook.)\n\n\nThe first 3 seasons of this show were basically a series of skits and sketches in which Big Show (I'm guessing) performs stunts and shows off his muscles. He then gets a coach (probably a retired professional wrestler?) who starts getting him into more legit wrestling moves. In a move that is typical of WWE programming of these days, he runs into \"The Beast\", who tries to stop him with all sorts of physical moves, but the Beast just tries to get him in a hold and Big Show just falls on a big metal table! It is actually kind of sad because I really like Big Show's character and I like seeing him work his way on to becoming a champion.\n\n\nThe Big Show in his big guy form in the first episode of the series.\n\n\nThe \"Big Show\" in the second episode of the series. This sequence is one of the most exciting in the entire series and features so many great bits and ideas.\n\n\nThe \"Big Show\" in his \"Tombstone\" theme song.\n\n\nThe \"Big Show\" in his \"Curb\" theme song. The episode is very funny as the \"Big Show\" fights every villain with the utmost brutality and then gets beaten down by \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage for some reason (Randy is actually pretty hot.) Finally he is brought down by \"Shawn Michaels\", who, among many other feats of strength is able to crush the \"Big Show\" in the middle of a ring with his bare hands.\n\n\nI really like the original ending that was scripted in so that the characters of the WWF could make any sort of comeback. The opening sequence with \"Shawn Michaels and Undertaker\" is great and I like that the two have a very violent battle in which Michaels manages to smash \"Shawn\" upside down into some kind of mat with one blow. \"Undertaker\" then proceeds to get on top of Michaels and is the one to go under the bottom rope into a tombstone and then get himself back to his feet. The end of this sequence shows the WWF wrestlers going at it in the ring and then the end credits to the theme song, which is awesome. (This is one of the only times that a WWF logo is shown after the end credits when they appear too quickly.)\n\n\nI really like how this show is not in an \"WWF style\" format and that is probably more true then you may think. The first season was mostly just a series of skits, sketches and music videos. The second season really tries to develop more plot lines and actually has a lot of character development. I think the producers were very happy with the ratings that show and wanted to try a new format.\n\n\nI think one of the best parts of the second season was it showing the wrestlers at the top of their game at the beginning of the series, and then some of them slowly dropping in ratings and going downhill. This was a great introduction for many fans and gives a real sense of how the WWF got to be who it is today. The second season was also edited in such a way that it showed Vince McMahon and the WWF trying to make money and make shows that are for sale for advertisers and if this were to occur again, we could expect \"Stuntman\", \"\"The Undertaker\",\"\" \"Randy Savage\" and others to be a part of the next season.\n\n\nIf you love the first season, then this show will probably be very enjoyable to you. At the same time you could easily watch it in spite and say that it is basically a garbage excuse for a wrestling show. The opening sequence and \"Dino Bravo\" are great and I think that the theme song, \"Curb\", is pretty good. Overall, this season was probably the best I've seen in a long time and I think that you need to watch this to see how this stuff worked behind the scenes of the WWF.\n\n\nIn Summary: \"The Big", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "The most self-indulgent movie I have every had the misfortune of seeing is a film called \"Sausage Party.\"\n\nIt was released in theaters this past Friday, and I watched it to my parents' horrified grins.\n\nA comedy about a bunch of slackers on a mission to \"Sausage Game,\" the plot of the movie is pretty dull and predictable. But, I'm more interested in the characters in the movie than the plot is. One of the people I'd like to mention from the movie is Josh Hutcherson. For some reason, he's not part of the cast. So I'm going to fill you in on the backstory of the guy.\n\n\"Bunnicula\" — Josh's nickname among his friends and former classmates — was never really cool. He was more of a bully and a pain in the neck. He lived with his girlfriend, his mom, and an older sibling in a family of eight. As mentioned, he was bullied as a child. When the family moved, he was sad in a lot of ways. But being in the middle of high school with all these fresh hormones (and a girl named Megan) had made him feel pretty good. Also, he was super into music. So while his friends were in \"going on tour\" mode and hanging out in the parking lot and being mean, he went to every shows up until that point, usually wearing headphones to block out the bass.\n\nAnd then, one night, Josh went out to go clubbing. He was trying to go back to the dorm, but he got lost. He ended up at a bar that wasn't being used at the time and got lucky that they didn't shut it down immediately, because they weren't planning on taking students home that night. They were open up until close, so he was really into walking home. When he got home, he was going to walk home and there was nothing on his way. He started walking toward his truck and a homeless guy who said he needed someone to help him move out because he was moving out, and Josh said, \"I ain't moving!\" But then Josh realized, \"I'm a bum! I live in front of my house! I'm homeless.\" Suddenly he's in this situation that he normally wouldn't be in. As he's walking back on the street, he sees a police car pull up. He sees an officer with a gun on him and he realizes that the police are going to kill him. And now Josh is sitting in a car alone, with this dead man sitting next to him.\n\nThis leads to many flashbacks to the day that Josh saw \"Sausage Party.\" It's a cool ending but at the same time it has a lot of \"what the fuck\" moments.\n\nJosh doesn't really believe in ghosts. So when he opens up his truck and finds the dead body on his lawn, he thinks it's one more sign that the forces of evil are making him relive his death when he's still alive. He's not actually dead, not really. He just got drunk and made a mistake. So then, like some twisted version of a \"Shrek\" moment, the whole movie unfolds the way you expect it to.\n\nBut Josh is also the kind of person who is good at hiding and covering things up. He can't believe that he would be arrested or prosecuted for something so stupid. And so a few days later, he pulls a gun on the police officer who just arrested him for being drunk and acting like a jerk to other people. Josh says if he doesn't get out of the car, the officer will shoot him. The officer goes ahead and does so, then pulls out his own gun afterwards. Joshua says if the cop shoots him in the face, he would never get out of jail alive.\n\nJosh gets shot.\n\nSo that's kind of a crazy movie. It's a lot of fun until the end. And it also raises questions for people who have the misfortune of being so close to Josh and his friends. Does Josh really live in the same house as his mom and girlfriend and brother? And who the heck would be living with them and doing all of the weird stuff, and wouldn't it be weird to have four bros who are all hanging out all the time?\n\nAnyway, it's really really hilarious. It's also one of the most poorly written movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching.", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "hypertrophic pachymeningitis is an uncommon disorder that causes a localized inflammation of the linings of the heart and lungs. In most cases, pachymeningitis develops slowly and is followed by shortness of breath, but it may cause death if you are predisposed to heart and pulmonary disease, if you have had recent infections, if you have underlying conditions that could trigger the disease such as obesity or smoking, or if you have a heart valve or other valve disease. People with heart valve disease, diabetes, or other severe cardiovascular diseases, should be particularly careful to avoid the risk of pachymeningitis. Pachymeningitis is generally diagnosed by auscultation or needle biopsy when evidence of inflammation of the linings of the heart and lungs is seen. Pachymeningitis is treated by the administration of inhaled steroids to reduce the inflammation and a course of therapy consisting of immunosuppressive medications to control inflammation of the lungs as well as medications to reduce the risk of blood clots.\n\nComplications of Pachymeningitis One of the most common complications of pachymeningitis is the risk of heart disease. In some patients, a pulmonary embolus causes prolonged pachymeningitis and in other cases, an infection causes rupture and infection of the valves or other parts of the lung. Severe pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening if a patient develops a significant infarction or rupture of heart valves (perforation) or of the pulmonary veins.\n\nPrevention of Pachymeningitis Preventing pachymeningitis should be one of the chief goals of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Lifestyle choices include: maintaining a healthy weight.\n\navoiding tobacco use and illicit drug use.", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "objectivethis study aimed to examine vitamin d status as a biomarker of metabolic risk in healthy populations.\n\nVitamin D status was assessed with a simple and reliable and sensitive urine 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 assay and quantified using a bio-analyzer (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA). Participants were classified according to serum 25(OH)D concentration, and dichotomous vitamin D status was defined by the lowest 25(OH)D concentration (45–75 nmol/L) in the analysis of serum 25(OH)D as the cut-off, based on previous literature [ 22 ].\n\nThe Medical Research Council (MRC) Biobank is funded by the Medical Research Council. We identified participants from data sets included in previous papers in the British population, with a similar age range of 17 to 79 years (average age 61). Blood was drawn from the tail vein on a fingerstick at the completion of the baseline examination, and serum was extracted and quantified with the use of a biochemical method (Quantitative Mass Spectrometry) and a validated method (25(OH)D assay). After extraction and quantification, 50 mg was divided into 2 plasma measurements and stored at −70°C until used for the study.\n\nParticipants were assessed using the Edinburgh Sleep Quality Index (ESQI) [ 20 ] and their fasting blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) levels were taken. An index for insulin resistance was used, as recommended by some studies [ 8, 14, 21 ]. At baseline, an insulin tolerance test was performed, which used the Zimbra insulin clamp (Monark Diagnostics, Oxford, England; model 810R; ZEUS) to measure insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in healthy non-diabetic subjects.\n\nA random sample of the 1000 participants was selected to undergo the cross-over study. From that subset, 50 participants were randomly assigned to DRI and 50 participants to control group. For the DRI group, the study consisted of weekly dietary advice to achieve a 25(OH)D concentration of 40 ng/ml at baseline (5 mg/day), a daily dose of 800 IU vitamin D 2 /d via a vitamin D supplement (Vegka, Merck and Co Ltd, USA) for 3–10 d before sampling (6 d) and then 1.5 mg/day vitamin D 3 /day (DRI group) or 0 mg/day vitamin D 3 /day (control group) for the next 7 d (6 d + 1 g) [ 14 ]. Following the DRI intervention, participants in the control group continued to receive their regular supplementation. After the second 10-d washout period, the participants in the DRI group were assigned to either DRI + calcium or control + calcium, and all other participants were reassessed 5 wk later, when they were on a calcium-supplementated diet. The DRI group received 3.75–5.75 mg vitamin D/d (calcium plus vitamin D 3 /d), whereas the control group received 1.15–1.65 mg vitamin D 2/d. The usual calcium supplementation regimen was not given during the study period, and blood samples were taken for measurement of calcium excretion. Participants in the control group continued their normal oral calcium supplement and were free to take vitamin D 3 supplements to treat their vitamin D deficiency. Detailed information regarding compliance was not available, although the usual calcium supplementation regimen was not given. All participants were contacted for regular blood counts, and no participants had any clinical signs or manifestations of bone disease (e.g., osteoporosis, osteopenia) during the study [ 14 ]. Participants in the control group continued to receive their usual oral calcium and multivitamins at the completion of the study. All participants completed a dietary history questionnaire and returned a written informed consent prior to participation. No participant withdrew from the clinical trial due to ethical reasons.\n\nThe protocol was approved by the Ethics Subcommittee of the Royal College of Physicians and Health Scientists (MRC Biobank, London, UK). All participants gave their written informed consent before being consented and completed a dietary history questionnaire, with a detailed assessment of food intake and serum 25(OH)D levels, when available.\n\nDRI participants experienced a significant increase in the bioavailable fraction of the vitamin D metabolites 25(OH)D and calcitriol over the course of the trial (see ). The relative increase for urinary vitamin D metabolites (calcitriol + 25(OH)D 1.04 ng/ml + 2.06 ng/ml + 1.18 ng/ml) was greater in the DRI group compared with the control group (P = 0.01).

{"text": "although the national health service ( nhs ) is regarded as a \"laboratory\" for assessing the effectiveness of the NHS, it has never been officially designated a \"clinical research center\" for clinical practice. Clinical research centers are subject to several federal requirements regarding funding and accreditation. There are 13 such centers located in the United States, including 3 in California and 1 in Texas. The NIH Center for Clinical Research in Primary Care (CCPRC) is the major federal center for conducting clinical trials and evaluating potential therapeutic approaches.\n\nThe CCPRC was formally established in 1983; its first study was the National Primary Care Study ( NPL ) of patients with hypertension [ 26 ]. CCPRC researchers initiated the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) survey to assess general health conditions and prevent-ability in 2003. For this survey, CCPRC investigators recruited a total of 38,400 adult participants via the website of the U.S. Army Nutrition Research Institute ( ARIN ) and the National Epidemiologic Survey, on which the study data were based. Participants were interviewed to receive the information about their health conditions. On their way to the interview, survey takers collected demographic data and medical and demographic questionnaire, which included the question about smoking status. On their return, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire about their health conditions. The questionnaire asked about the frequency of self-reported adverse health conditions, the prevalence of those conditions, symptoms, treatments, and comorbidities. For other important information such as diagnosis of coronary disease, participants were asked to provide additional information related to whether coronary disease was a diagnosed medical condition (e.g., whether coronary artery disease had been diagnosed), with the option of providing a statement of self-reported status or a medical diagnosis. In addition, as a component of these self-reported responses, participants were invited to provide information about the treatment of their health condition. The survey also asked whether participants had been treated in a specialty clinic in the previous year and, if so, the size of that clinic. If they stated that they had not, the surveytakers were able to locate the clinic through the telephone directory and contact the doctor or other health care worker responsible for the diagnosis.\n\nAs of March 1, 2003, NCRR, with its principal goal of evaluating treatments for depression and anxiety, enrolled 18,879 participants. Participants were recruited from 12 sites throughout the United States and administered a computer-delivered questionnaire to assess their depression and anxiety and to answer questions about personal history and other important aspects of their lives (i.e., employment, family, community). During the baseline phase of the study, 5,300 participants provided more complete responses on all of the major depression and anxiety questions. Of these, 4,062 completed the final evaluation and were enrolled as full participants, the 5,300 remaining participants completing the baseline phase were considered the study sample. Data were used to evaluate the efficacy of nine treatment modalities: cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, brief interpersonal therapy, antidepressant medications, placebo medications, combined mood stabilizer/antidepressant medications, psychodysleptic medications, anxiety-control strategies, and yoga and prayer.\n\nDuring its 10-year history, the CCRC has supported more than 130 publications. A few of these publications are described below:\n\nWe recently conducted a retrospective electronic search of published research reports written about CCRC and specifically the most recent 9-month period, 1996–1999, using MEDLINE and the PsychINFO system's \"Search\" facility (http://www.psychinfo.org/). We retrieved 33 reports, covering 2,208 participants. The majority of these reports were by researchers working at the CCRC and many were written by other researchers outside of CCRC. Three of these reports described the CCRC's clinical trial programs and were conducted at the other two research centers that were funded by the CCRC. One report described the effect of CCRC's Clinical Treatment Evaluation Program (CTEP) on individuals with cancer at the other two research centers that received CCRC support. In addition, five of the reports presented research published in CCRC's peer-reviewed journals, including one that had been initially accepted with the title \"Treatment Programs for Depression and Anxiety\" [ 24 ]. Nine other reports were published in the journals of major journals for research into health issues and included one report showing the superiority of CCRC's cognitive behavioral therapy to standard neuroleptic medication in reducing the rates of relapse in patients with depression [ 26 ].\n\nA total of 619 participants were recruited in 1998 or 1999 as the first phase of this study. From this initial group, an additional 14,013 were randomized to 6 different treatments, to determine the effects of the various treatments on psychological distress and clinical outcomes. From these additional participants, 667 were retained for analysis (n = 5,834) as the baseline group and 708 also were retained to provide additional analyses and data for comparisons of treatment efficacy.\n", "label": "gpt2"}

To the right of the desk he has a long, curved, wooden cabinet filled with a variety of books and manuscripts, including his recently published book, \"The Grand Tour: The New York Times and the World's Best Newspapers.\" To the left, next to a big empty desk, hangs a family Christmas photo — a picture of a family sitting on a porch looking out over the nearby forest, smiling at their grandchildren.

I want to know how you stay so upbeat.\n\n\"I'm sure that's the way that the family always felt,\" he says.\n\nOn February 18, the Amsterdam schoolteacher got his first taste of what's coming next when the news broke that Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte had announced his resignation. On the same day, another politician got fired — former Dutch Labor Minister Gert-Jan Krogman.\n\n\"I couldn't take it. I couldn't have handled more bad news,\" Hoekstra explains. \"For a woman like me, I didn't want to be in the middle of it.\" What the people of Europe need now is a leader like him. \"I believe I can bring in a very different style to the political parties. I've always been interested in politics, but not in the business-style parties. We're talking about the future of the European continent. We must create an environment where countries can collaborate and come together. Europe will always change, because Europe's core is going to evolve, but the main issues will not change. The values will stay the same. So I would like to be the prime minister of a positive European agenda, where we can find common ground, work together, and create an integrated European Union and a European federalist strategy.\"\n\nBack in Hoekstra's office, his son Dirk is working on some of his projects, including the reassembly of his father's old wooden boat — the \"Sparta II,\" to keep it rust-free as he ages. The boat holds eight to ten cubic meters of water and cost between one and two million euros (at the time of this writing). With a boat like this, even a single leak can send the boat over the edge.\n\n\"We're making a real boat,\" he says.\n\n\nIn fact, he's making two boats now. \"I'm having them done in collaboration with two French mechanics who are very very talented,\" he says. \"They're repairing the parts that need repairing, and they're making furniture in one vessel. They're not building a real boat, but this vessel doesn't need as extensive repairs as the original because we're really not going to do a total overhaul.\" As we talk, Dirk hoists a wooden wheel from the bottom of the boat and starts winding it, while the young mechanic hangs around as another worker adjusts the sail.\n\nWith that, we head outside to check out the sun.

{"text": "we study the semilinear partial differential equation ( pde ) for the convective transport ( ctx ) for one particle of a gas in a gas. If the particle is not in contact with its environment ( i.e., the diffusion constant ε = 3.85×10−4 m2/s) then there is no convective transport. If the interaction energy between the two particles, which is given by the kinetic energy of the particles (E K ) is less than the effective thermal energy at the point of contact with the gas (k 1 / 2E), then the particles must be bound. For a gas, it can be shown that the effective thermal energy and the effective kinetic energy must always be conserved by local adiabatic compression. The partial differential equation has some good properties for a particular type of fluid in which there is no thermal enthalpy on the particles. However, its properties can also be improved by including the effective enthalpy on the particles (2). This has been done successfully in the thermodynamic studies of the transition from gas to vapor and of the thermal diffusion and absorption of particles in the gas phase.

{"text": "Wow! I picked this off the rental shelf because I was told it was very expensive. It is on the pricier side to get in for the month, but the great part is it has a small but well lit bed and a comfortable chair. The mattress is a little stiff but I'm sure a nice little mattress and a soft reclining chair will make the experience much better. I think what was wrong with my first rental was that the bedroom was in a bad part of the house. The landlord said they did not have one small bedroom in the house, so the bedroom in this house is smaller than it should be at just over 5ft wide and 6ft deep. The carpet is great in general and the bedding is nice and comfy.\n\nThe biggest negative I will say about this place is that the water line is just about a foot above the ceiling and I had to take a hammer and chisel to it when the electrician came through to fix the bathroom wall last week. I have not had a chance to inspect the plumbing yet, but I expect it to be very bad.\n\nI am very impressed by the place. I am a new tenant and it is very well furnished. The place is so clean that I am looking for a bigger place with the same amount of space. The landlord is very easy going and it seems like everything has been kept up very well except for the water line issue. We all are so far on time with all our appointments. This was my first apartment and this was my first real hassle. I just hope everything goes smoothly with the sewer work so we avoid having to deal with the water line issue that comes up from time to time.\n\nI moved to South Pasadena last week and had to wait awhile before my landlord signed me in and gave me our key. Since i did not stay anywhere for a long period of time I ended up staying there for about 1 weekend. I didn't appreciate it until the next morning when I decided to go in for a shower. It took me 15 to 20 minutes to get to the bathroom which was directly in front of us. I could hear my shower running and when I got in it seemed like no water was coming out. I would have walked a block or 2 and it would have cleared out. On a previous visit at 30th and Los Robles I had to walk a block or two past it. Then a week ago it was still there. When I called my landlord today to ask for an address so I could get my key he told me that the area around the kitchen where nobody lives is considered a 'public lot area'. So they will take care of the water lines. No problem! When we had breakfast there yesterday we were surprised at how nice it all looked. All in all we just thought the bathrooms were kinda dirty and some walls were cracked. I would say it was pretty decent of a new place if you don't have to wait quite as long to get a key.\n\nMy old place, my home. Home of my greatest fear, the dark dark of my soul. I would like to thank everyone who came out and joined me. Thank you to the people in the street, thank you to the neighbors who were so nice. I got to meet my first real LA neighbors and see the view from my door. Most importantly the house is filled with beautiful memories of my childhood, the good, the bad and the ugly. My little home. It has been my home for 10 years now. It's about time I got to share my own home with all the other wonderful people that visit here. With that said, you deserve a little bit more love. I was happy to have my door pried, my garbage picked up, my pool cleaned up, my bed was made, the shower was made and my windows have been cleaned. It has also been decided to bring back the trash cans but on the outside of the building. Just not next door. All in all, everything was wonderful, just as I could have ever hoped and then some.\n\nGreat place to rent a place! The apartment was clean and a lot of the items were well maintained. I had a great time in there.\n\nWe have had it for about 8 months as a month to month lease. Since then, the building has been completely remodeled by our local builder. Everything has been done but unfortunately the new unit is too far off the street in front of us. The new unit overlooks the street and has a huge window like ours, however, it also requires you to share two bathrooms with a roommate, and at this rate, we won't be able to do that. A lot of the apartment is done up in a much nicer way than ours, but it's not a great deal at this rate. If you don't mind sharing or don't mind the $1/tank maintenance fee, this place is a great choice. Otherwise, it's not worth the hassle and that's the reason we're giving it one star", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "a general method for compressing the modulation time - bandwidth or phase can be calculated very accurately so that in the event of an error, no extra information is lost (unless the error is large, which is unlikely).\n\nThe above method of generating the phase-coherent frequency, given the time-invariant phase and frequency, is a general method. It can be used for all sorts of purposes such as generating audio signals with time-domain phase and frequency modulation (eg. audio signal generators, digital audio converters etc), for digital control of an AM radio receiver or other digital radio equipment, or for generating time-division-synchronous (DDS) audio signals.\n\nNote:- If the phase of our modulation source and our frequency source are the same, the phase error can never exceed the frequency error by some small amount, and the ratio of the two errors is called the phase shift error. There are also general methods for solving various types of phase errors, for some of which it can be useful to consult a reference such as O'Malley.\n\nIn practice, the phase error becomes larger with longer times for the time domain phase but smaller for the frequency domain phase so any large phase errors will result in either the modulation being degraded or the other end of the chain not being able to provide proper modulation. This can be shown in the following plot:\n\nHere is an example. We have two audio signals which are perfectly well balanced for one frequency but are clearly distorted (left) and we measure the phase error in the frequency domain with a sinusoid. We then multiply this sinusoid with the other frequency before applying a gain to achieve a level to which no external distortion can introduce.\n\nThere are two key observations:\n\nAt both frequencies, the phase error is positive (and not zero) at about 1 kHz. We get a positive phase shift difference when the period of the sinusoid is longer. This means that the phase error in the period domain will rise as the time for the sinusoid's period doubles. The positive time domain phase error will not be as large as the frequency (negative phase offset error).\n\nThe positive phase offset error shows up as 'cross-talk' between the modulation and the other end. The negative phase offset error is not visible, which may be because some internal distortion could be doing most of it.\n\nOne way to reduce negative phase offset error in the time domain is to add a sinusoidal signal with very large frequency that crosses over between the two channels.\n\nIn the above plot (in stereo to make the horizontal scale and right-angled so it shows both channels), you can see the sinusoidal signal is crossed over between the left and middle channels. The source can have many harmonics with a time domain frequency, and each is an error in harmonics of the phase error. When these harmonics cancel, so that you add up their effects, you end up with a much nicer error with smaller phase error.\n\nThe above plot shows the phase error in the frequency domain (the left side) was reduced by 3.0 dB when a sinusoid with a frequency of around 120 Hz crossed over at around 3 kHz.\n\nThere is a lot of interesting mathematical theory behind this diagram with lots you can do with it. If you want to look more in depth, here is a website that has all sorts of formulas and some good references for working with phase and frequency.\n\nNow we can understand how to apply a sinusoid here. The sinusoid will have the same frequency (the frequency of the sinusoid), phase, and phase offset but will be a phase shifter. The idea of a sinusoid is to phase shift the phase of the signal from one frequency to another (a modulation signal if you will). The original signal remains the same but the time domain phase is shifted so that it is always between 0 and +1 (plus or minus) depending on the phase to which it is shifted by half the phase of the source. So we can think of this as the phase shifting a series of sine waves into a harmonic waveform.\n\nIf you multiply a wave by a sinusoid, you are also multiplying the sinusoid which is multiplied by the current time step you are using and that can only be positive time steps, so you end up with a sinusoid that is positive for all current time steps, not just half the time steps.\n\nWe start out with a sinusoidal frequency of 6 Hz and we multiply it by a sinusoid frequency of 360 degrees (which becomes 1 Hz) and we multiply that that same sinusoid frequency by a sinusoid frequency of 360 degrees. We can get a sinusoidal frequency of 12.5 Hz if we double that value, but note that this is not the same frequency as that of each of the 1 Hz x 360 degrees sinus", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "A defiant Theresa May has stood by the decision to call a snap general election in order to strengthen her leadership ahead of talks with European leaders over Britain's exit from the EU.\n\nAnd despite a surge in the number of Britons who voted leave last week, Ms May revealed she still wanted to keep \"control\" of \"the number of people we allow into our country\".\n\nThe Prime Minister said: \"When people came out in the referendum on June 23 they did so because they wanted control over the number of people we allow into our country, they did not say we wanted to control the number of jobs that we created.\"\n\nMore than half a million people took to the streets of London to take part in a demonstration in support of the Remain side.\n\nTory MP Stephen Phillips was among those who staged a loud but brief walk out in the House of Commons, urging Ms May to reverse her decision.\n\nMr Phillips was followed by MPs for the remain camp.\n\nMr Phillips told the Daily Telegraph he was standing by his promise to \"stand like Caesar in the Senate\".\n\n'Power of the purse'\n\nHe added: \"I will do everything I can to help the Prime Minister get back into power. My view as her friend is I want to see this referendum on our future, we have not had a meaningful debate, we have actually let the European Union down in so many ways.\n\n\"To see this referendum dragged on so long and the pressure on the prime minister has grown so much, I do not think that is the right course for the country.\n\n\"I think people in Westminster are beginning to realise what a mistake was made. It was not for the referendum and she has now lost the power of the purse.\"\n\nAhead of the referendum, Ms May said the UK would leave the European Union \"as soon as we can\" and promised to secure the \"best possible deal\" for Britain outside the bloc.\n\nHer speech had been widely seen as a referendum gamble because the vote could give her a mandate to hold the election before the next election, due in 2020.\n\nBut voters backed leave by a margin far more than last week's vote and the Prime Minister's position on the issue has been condemned for months.\n\n'Losing credibility'\n\nOne Cabinet minister said the polls had come in for one reason and one reason only: Brexit.\n\nShe added: \"People are sick of her. She knows this and the more people see her losing the credibility that is her advantage, the more they will choose to do for themselves whatever is best for them.\"\n\nSpeaking in Downing Street, Mr Jenkins, said: \"I can accept the argument that the referendum result was not what people came to this country to vote for.\n\n\"But the reality is this is a decision that we all face. We will make a new decision at the time of the next election and after that we will sit down and negotiate to have a better relationship.\"\n\nHe denied ministers were divided on the issue. He said it was for voters to decide the UK's exit from the bloc but said the government \"will remain committed\" to leaving the customs union at the same time.\n\nThe announcement came as business groups said the Brexit vote had cost the UK economy up to £250bn a year.\n\nMore than a million people took part in the rally in central London, as more than 100 Downing Street protesters carried banners which read: \"Leave the EU we don't want a border between us and Europe\".\n\nIn a separate event on Tuesday morning, Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, called for a \"bold Brexit\", saying: \"For me this is not about the specifics of the relationship with the EU but about the long-term viability of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nMr Johnson, who has been among the most pro-leave members of the cabinet, said his dream Brexit was a \"jobs-first\" deal, in which the UK retains ties with Europe but does as much trade as possible with the world.\n\nOn immigration, he added: \"We should take an opportunity to create the right conditions for businesses in our cities and towns, and for young people from all parts of the EU, by cutting net migration to the tens of thousands.\"\n\nMr Johnson said he would also advocate for a referendum on whether the UK should stay in the single market - the EU's largest export market.\n\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was accused by Labour of taking people for \"marionettes\" or puppets when he said he still hoped for a no deal deal scenario.\n\nDuring his speech in Florence, Mr Cameron told MEPs he wanted \"the best possible deal for Britain", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "Remember growing up as a kid, what did you do?\n\nI didn't do anything with my hands.\n\nWhy were you never taught to use your hands for things? Did you grow up poor?\n\nWell, I'm a product of the system. I never really had a chance to play football, go on a field, or grow up outside. So when I was little, I picked up a football and I played with my hands, and I used to use my toes, which at that time were no more than one millimeter long. Now I'm a football player at 40 years old, and I'm still throwing my own legs and my head as hard as I can because I believe in that kind of stuff. It's not something I necessarily learned in school, it's learned on the road because you've got to go and play and practice when you play. And that's where the practice comes in. And when we came to the U.S. as a family, we were the only Indian family in Southern California. Because we was the only Indians in Southern California, when they first came, there was not really a place to go and play and stuff like that. It was just us and one school. And the closest thing to playing was like what we found in Southern California.\n\nIn some ways growing up in the U.S., in the suburbs of California in a different household—it's much different to go out in the neighborhood and play football, I mean, what can you say? You've got to use your legs or you're a kid. That's really the only thing you can say. I don't know if your mom was a coach, but I just had to have my legs and my head and work for everything. Then, later on, I'm playing at this position called fullback, you've got to use both feet. It's just different. But yeah, I still had to work for my stuff, no question about it.\n\nSo, when you started to start going to high school in the U.S., what was that like for you?\n\nThat's where my love for college football started. We didn't necessarily go to a different school, it's kind of where we found out that we actually liked college football. So I started to study and play a whole lot, but you know, at the same time as you study and you play, you know, I was studying too, because I wanted to be the best I could possibly be at all times. I knew I didn't know everything, I knew how to do this, I knew how to do that, I knew a lot, but you know, I kept my finger on the pulse. And so I kept going to different places to learn different stuff, going to Alabama when they played Southern Miss and things like that. And I didn't really play in college the first time, I didn't play for three years because I was like, \"I can't even do it.\" And then I started to go back to college every spring, and I think I took another year off to go back and play [at Georgia—Ed.]. I played with an injury and an Achilles rupture after my junior year, but the Achilles worked well enough and it made me stronger than I was beforehand. So I went back to Georgia, and then the next year I went back to college for my senior year and they gave me a full scholarship.\n\nI didn't have that one year off, and so as a senior, I played against Florida, Georgia Tech, South Carolina, Notre Dame, I played against all of them. I thought I had a pretty good season, but then I got hurt and I kind of sat out. I went to practice, but then I played, I played very good for two years, but then, once the Achilles tear happened, my football career kind of came to an end. As a result of the Achilles tear, my career was over. But my love for college football, I'm still at it. So, I'm still playing and I'm still at it, and it's still one of the biggest things in my life right now. So it's very rewarding to do.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "this work evaluated activity levels in a group of healthy adult male subjects while they (1) passively observed, and (2) engaged in physical activity. The activity level was determined by the subjects' reports of movement (e.g., \"Did I walk or move around?\" or \"Did I just put my hands on my lap?\"). In a second study, participants reported their subjective feelings of fatigue while participating in a walking performance test. The purpose of this protocol was to examine the relationship between objective and subjective feelings of fatigue and the amount of movement during the performance test of an intermittent walking task. Subjects were instructed to continuously walk forward while the screen displayed their performance as a function of the length of the walk required to reach the end of the screen. A mean of ten trials of a 30-second stopwatch (VIC), repeated 30 times, was used. In addition, subjective feelings of fatigue were measured before and after the intermittent activity trial using a 10-point Likert scale. The correlation between the subjective feelings of fatigue and actual movement is not provided.", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific properties include Turing's 1955 problem of finding the shortest path between two points, and the 1973 problem of how to find a set of consecutive permutations of an element. Both are based on solving tasks where most decisions would be based on the existing knowledge of a set of characters. The only difference here is that this time, the system is a computer that knows the answers to the problems you are given, it has just no memory of the actual tasks you are asked to perform.\n\nThis is the sort of problem that computers are better at, as they do the computations more efficiently and are better at generalising in real environments, i.e. they can find solutions to problems of a general size to which they can be generalised to (Tuesdays talk).\n\nThe problem of getting a computer to do things a human cannot without the aid of a human can, of course, be solved. Turing's 1952 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" (Tuesdays talk) proved how to reduce the problem of programming a general purpose computer to a small set of problems that humans can efficiently solve. Today, many of the problems solved in programming have been solved using techniques like recursion, which involve building recursively large sub-problems as their solution, and are still used by many programming languages.\n\nTuring's argument, in these two papers, was that it would be possible to program a computer that could be both more intelligent (since the machine would retain its knowledge of other tasks) without reducing it to a human, and yet could store less information. Using a set of simple problem solving techniques that a human could easily grasp, and which would probably also allow a computer to learn and reason (as Turing and Leijonhuis both noted), one can build a computer that can learn in much the same way that our own human brains do. This idea is now known as \"deep memory\", and we have found it is useful to understand how this works.\n\nSome of the ideas first proposed by Turing\n\nThe work of Alan Turing in developing the practical computer is often cited most often by those who reject his ideas. Turing proposed the Turing Machine as a tool for building such a machine, and it was used to solve a number of problems. Turing was also involved in the development of quantum computing, which requires that the computer has no memory of its past activities at all (this is similar to what we are trying to develop, i.e. a computer capable of having no memories about any tasks it has already completed).\n\nFor decades, people working on artificial general intelligence (AGI) have been trying to understand what is required to make a machine that can solve any problem a human can solve, with no additional information or memory required to solve those problems. And there have been a number of different approaches considered. Many different kinds of systems have been proposed, and no single approach has been widely accepted.\n\nThe Turing Machine, which is a computer that has no memory, is said to be the best known of these approaches (for example, see the paper \"Computer programs that can learn\" by Tom Mitchell and Andrew Brown). These systems also have no \"thinking\" element—they are only just approximations (we are building up from a state of a machine to some output), but still, they are thought to be much more useful than human-built systems—they are better at carrying out mathematical calculations, they have \"unlimited\" memory, and they can be combined with other system to solve tasks in more complicated situations.\n\nThe key idea in many of these systems is called \"recursive self-improvement\". These \"recursive\" systems work by making small improvements, each time asking a new question, which often leads to a new state. But the question is not \"tell me how you are doing well now\". Rather, the question is to \"what is the best way you can improve, on the current state, to get closer to the best you can be?\"\n\nThis process involves \"obtaining a large body of practical knowledge about the problem to be solved\". This is often described as \"programming in advance\". Some systems just work with known quantities, such as the size of the problem and how to get it done. Others need to know enough to perform the computation in a way that is \"efficient\", but not so much that the computation itself takes forever. Still many of them make their progress in a step-by-step, and \"explain in detail the whole course of action that the computer has to follow.\"\n\nMost of these systems also have a \"logistic function\", a function that gives some probability distribution over all possible solutions to the problem. This \"logistic function\" is a very simple, and very powerful, concept.\n\nTuring's original ideas\n\nIn order to understand Turing's ideas of how to represent a human's intelligence", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "the continuous - time quantum monte carlo method is applied as a direct method of measuring the position and momentum of a particle. This method is based on the principle of a closed-loop system in which the system includes the measurement element (measurement unit) and the particle. Each measurement process is isolated and linked to the measurement unit so as to be identical.\n\nThe single particle position is found by using the momentum measurement (measurement unit) to determine the momentum of the particle and the unitary motion of the particle. This principle is useful for determining the particle's trajectory from the position. The particle momentum is used in the process to measure the particle's position. This method is a complete process with respect to particles, measurement elements, and the measurements in a measurement unit. If the measurement system is a particle which, by applying an external force, is repelled by an external reference point, the position and momentum of the particle are determined by the action of the external force upon the particle. There are other methods of determining the position and velocity of particles and all other aspects of these processes are discussed under the general aspects of measurements. The methods are separated into two distinct groups as follows: Direct methods (A: E) Single particle position and momentum measurement methods (C:D)\n\nA:E. A:E methods. The fundamental result of the single particle position and momentum measurement methods is the equation\n\nwhere m and g are the momenta of single particles respectively. Another more concise equation which represents the principle of a measurement in the present state of the art (including the application of the principles of quantum mechanics and of relativity) is\n\n(15)\n\nThe measurement system includes an external target (the measurement unit). As the system approaches the target the speed of the system is increased to achieve the measurement. If the speed is limited by the target's speed, the speed of the measurement to the target can be expressed as the time integral of the position of the measurement unit from the target. The external force used to overcome the target (the external reference point) is expressed by a constant force F. The value of F for a given system is determined by the interaction between the applied force and the target. The force F for a given acceleration R is given in Equation (18) where R is the acceleration in units of time. The unit of F is the foot-pound (lb) unit or the centimeter-second (cm) unit. As noted above, a unit of time is always in units of hours (h). These terms are used to convert from degrees to radians or vice versa. In units of radians the force and position of the system are specified in terms of x, y, and z coordinates. The coordinates are defined in such a way that\n\n(16)\n\nA:E. A:E methods. The principle of a measurement in the present state of the art can be developed so as to solve any equation relating the position and momentum of the unit to that of the external target. If the external target is an arbitrary reference, the solution to the equations for the velocity and position of the unit are derived by the procedure described in (A) above. If the external target is a known target, the solution to the equations for the position are given by the method of linear algebra described in Equation (1). Thus, all of the applications of the single particle position and momentum measurement methods listed in Table 1 can be explained by the principles of position and momentum measurement for a position and momentum measurement system containing an external target. The complete result of the single particle position and momentum measurement for a position and momentum measurement system containing an external target is stated in Table 3. This table does not refer to the specific position and momentum measurement method or the particular unit of measurement. Instead, it gives the relationship between the position and velocity of the particle of mass m, the momentum of the particle, and the external force F F used to overcome the external reference point. Thus, this table gives the form of equations necessary to solve an equation relating the magnitude of the position of the measurement unit, the size and position of the external target, and the value of the external force F F to be used to overcome the external target. The solutions to all such equations are obtained by directly integrating the time derivative of the position of the measurement unit. This is another way to develop the principle of position and momentum measurement. Note that Equation (5), (6), (7) and (8) should be read together. The equation\n\n(17)\n\nstates that any system with a certain value of F and a certain external target velocity and position may be written as (18)\n\n(19)\n\nThus, the position of the particle in one measurement unit of time t is equal to the velocity of the particle at t in a measurement unit of time t' corresponding to the external force F, as follows.

Two families are in danger from a terrorist. A woman with a daughter tries to stop them. Her son saves the day. The film has this strange look to the shooting at the beginning, some of the characters all look oddly similar and have a similar shape to the actors, as the action picks up. It is hard to work out who is who. It is quite a nice film, with the sound and image so realistic that I did not expect it to have any CGI or special effects. The acting is all excellent. I've been a fan of Michael Dahan, and I enjoyed the work that he did in the last few Mad Max titles as well. The film feels completely real to me because it has to be.

{"text": "As of the 2010 United States Census, southern California has about 7.7 million people, not including areas outside of city limits. So by comparing the 2010 census to 2008, it seems as if our population has increased by more than a million people in four years (and is now just shy of 7.7 million).\n\nOn average, the population of all three areas in 2010 was 8.2 percent higher than the population of the California population overall (including out-of-state residents) that year. As with most areas of the country, though, the population of cities outside of Los Angeles and San Diego increased more slowly — in 2010, the city of Riverside had the population 8.6 percentage points higher than the state as a whole, while the state as a whole had a population 8.0 percentage points higher than Riverside.\n\nHow does Los Angeles compare to other big cities in the U.S.? It ranks eighth in population across the U.S., according to the 2013 American Community Survey. But as with any comparison, we don't have any idea what these numbers would look like today, given the growth that California saw from 2000 to 2010.\n\nThe most notable factor in our population growth is international immigration. California's population grew 3.7 percent in 2010 over the previous decade — from about 6.6 million to 7.2 million.\n\nAbout half of the growth in our population came from non-citizen legal immigrants; this is less than half the 4.2 percent growth seen nationally, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nAmong the foreign-born residents came mainly from India, with about 3 million in the state, followed by China and Mexico.\n\nIn 2010, the top five countries of origin for Californians living in the state were India (2.0 million), China, Mexico, Philippines and the Philippines (1.3 million each). By comparison, about 600,000 Californians lived in the Philippines.\n\nAs you might expect, our native-born population also grew more slowly over the past decade. Since 2000, native-born Californians have increased about 3.1 percent, while immigrants grew 3.4 percent.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this. Immigrants aren't all from Asia. About half are from Europe and Canada. The remaining immigrant group comes from elsewhere.\n\nCalifornia's foreign-born population may also reflect the fact that some U.S.-born residents who moved elsewhere, such as retirees, left the state but stayed in their parents' home state, perhaps as California residents. Immigrants in their late 20s or early 30s also might be counted in the foreign-born population of someone who moved to another state but returned home to California.\n\nWhat is clear is that California's increasing population is also changing the state's overall political makeup in many areas. About half the state's population is minorities, as one would expect from a state that has a large Latino population. The share of Californians who are white stayed about the same, and the nation as a whole was roughly the same. Blacks, who accounted for just 8.2 percent of California's population in 2000, made up 26.4 percent in 2010. And Asians, who make up 7.1 percent of Los Angeles County's population, accounted for 12.7 percent, up from 10.9 percent in 2000.\n\nOur state's population could grow more slowly or faster than other places in the country. We have fewer native-born Americans because so many native-born Americans leave the state. We have more newcomers because we have more international immigrants — many of them from China, India and other Asian countries.\n\nWe don't yet know what the California trend will be for the next decade. We do know, given what we already observe, that this is happening in our state — that there's always going to be more growth, and that it will be happening on a region-wide basis.\n\nFor more stats on the California population and demographics, head over to the Pew Research Center's latest report on the state of California.\n\n• Email: bkalinowski@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @briankalinowski", "label": "gpt2"}

The two wavesform, R and @math0, are sent through an analog receiver, R', to a processing circuit, R', for digital processing to produce a voltage level, @xmath0' of the capacitive coupling capacitor, and the voltage level @math1' of the capacitive coupling capacitor, and as a result, voltage at the output node as a result of the power supply of the nonvolatile memory.\n\nAccording to a third aspect of this invention is provided a radio frequency communication system where a high frequency antenna, such as a horizontal-polarized horizontal-coaxial antenna, a vertically polarized horizontal-coaxial antenna, a monopole antenna, an antenna having an inverted cross section or an inverted vertical-polarized vertical-coaxial antenna, an electronically-controlled-polarization antenna, and a vertically-polarized horizontal-coaxial antenna, a signal input to the receiving antenna includes a beam forming element, said beam forming element being an antenna having a high-frequency response, where the beam forming element contains an organic dielectric that is thermally stable at a given temperature and at the ambient temperature of the transmission medium. The signal input to the receiving antenna includes an analog signal from an electronically-controlled-polarization antenna input to the receiving antenna. The signal input to the receiving antenna is then propagated to a processing circuit by coupling the signal input to the high-frequency antenna. The processing circuit output voltage is an analog voltage level of the capacitive coupling capacitor, and the voltage level @math0' of the capacitive coupling capacitor. As a result, the output voltage, @math0' is proportional to the peak-to- peak voltage of the transmitter signal.\n\nA more specific embodiment of this embodiment is a system that employs a high-frequency antenna, such as a vertical-polarized vertical-coaxial antenna, an electrometer in a tuning fork position or a tunable electromagnetic waveband, the transmitter of that waveband having a high-frequency response, the antenna and the radio frequency source being a low-frequency signal source with a high-frequency response. The receiving antenna, the antenna having a high-frequency response, a transmitter having a low-frequency response. A low-frequency signal input to the antenna. The output signal of the radio frequency source is propagated to a processor, the processing circuit then outputting at the output node an analog voltage level, the output voltage level of said voltage level being output at the ground node. The output voltage being an analog voltage at a temperature of a transmission medium level.\n\nA more specific embodiment of this additional arrangement is a system where a high-frequency high-impedance transmitter, the transmitter having a high-frequency response, two low-frequency low-impedance receivers, the receiver having a high-frequency high-impedance output, and the analog signal from the receivers is converted to an analog signal of 0.5 MΩ and an analog voltage output of the output coil of a high voltage amplifier. A processing circuit, the processing circuit outputting the voltage level at an analog input of the amplifier being proportional to the carrier frequency.

{"text": "concurrence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) with autoimmune hepatitis.1 It is also worth noting, since alcohol-induced hepatitis is the most serious adverse reaction observed in alcoholic patients, in clinical studies, in which alcohol and alcohol use were controlled adequately, alcohol and alcohol use were reported to be associated with less of a risk for other liver damage than was in studies in which alcohol use and alcohol use were uncontrolled, as described previously.1 These observations have been confirmed in multiple controlled studies in which alcohol, alcohol intake, and consumption of alcohol and alcohol use were controlled to various degrees, with similar negative results that confirm the adverse effects or potential adverse effects associated with excessive heavy drinking including liver damage, as outlined previously.1\n\nThe relationship between alcohol and liver damage in alcoholic men is not well established since alcoholism is considered to be more prevalent in men than women.2 In fact, although more women are diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) than men with this problem, men are diagnosed with nash more often than women are.2\n\nIn alcoholics, alcohol can cause fibrosis of the liver as well as liver cells in the liver to die. Liver fibrosis is a type of cirrhosis because the fatty tissues of the liver are gradually destroyed.2 The most common types of fibrosis in alcoholic cirrhosis are cirrhosis-causing bile ducts, which typically occurs at around 20% of fibrosis cases, and cirrhosis-causing gallbladder. Liver cirrhosis is more common in the extreme alcoholic population—a combination of alcohol abuse and alcohol and drug abuse—because moderate alcohol abuse is not necessarily sufficient to produce alcoholic liver injury.2,3\n\nHepatitis is a very common liver and related chronic disease that mainly affects the liver. Although alcoholic hepatitis is usually thought to be a chronic liver disease, in fact, if symptoms such as fever, hepatitis and jaundice are present, it is sometimes difficult to diagnose the underlying disease pathophysiology. Moreover, patients with hepatitis who undergo liver resection are less likely to develop full recovery than patients without hepatitis, although it is known that in the majority of patients, hepatitis is fully treated.2,3\n\nIn general, the body's immune system attacks the liver by releasing chemicals that cause damage to liver cells. The severity of the liver damage depends upon the inflammatory response of the liver. Therefore, chronic inflammation is usually associated with milder and less severe liver lesions. Alcohol itself does not cause inflammation, but its excess use stimulates the immune system to create excessive levels of the inflammation-causing substance.2\n\nThe liver was once regarded as a self-cleansing organ, but as the amount of alcohol used by the average person continues to rise to the point that liver fibrosis is more common, so does the potential for alcohol-induced damage to the liver.2,3 The chronic inflammation caused by alcohol also makes alcoholics more susceptible to other chronic disorders, such as the development of cancer.2 In fact, the majority of people who develop hepatitis do so within the first 10 years of becoming an alcoholic.3,4 It is difficult to say how much of the increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma—the most common type of liver cancer—comprises the increased incidence of chronic hepatitis that could be related to alcohol-related liver damage, but if the incidence of liver cancer continues to rise with rising alcohol consumption, as is the case in the United States, the increasing popularity of the beverage might contribute further to the increase in the incidence of this type of cancer.3\n\nAcetaminophen is the active ingredient that is used for pain relief that is reported to cause liver injury in some people. Acetaminophen exerts potent anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant activities.1 When acetaminophen is consumed in excess the body produces more and more of these substances, thereby forming acetaminophen-associated hepatotoxicity ( AHAH ), resulting in alcohol-induced damage in the liver. Acetaminophen overdoses that cause alcohol-induced liver failure have been reported in 3 US case reports and in multiple hospitalizations in which acetaminophen poisoning was the cause of death.1 According to the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, acetaminophen toxicity can be dangerous if taken by people who are not taking other anti-inflammatory medications.3,4\n\nBecause of the increased risk of liver injury in chronic drinkers, studies in which alcohol was controlled, the alcohol-dependent subjects were monitored closely and all medications and medical medications were stopped, and measures were taken to determine whether or not the patients had liver damage, had undergone liver transplantation, or demonstrated evidence of hepatitis.2,3 One case study reported that those patients who consumed alcohol more than 2 g or more per day had a two-fold increase in the risk of receiving a liver transplant within one year of having acetaminophen poisoning.2 It is possible that liver disease", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "As Tony Abbott said ad nauseam during the campaign, the Coalition will spend $50 billion on education and the rest on health, welfare and infrastructure.\n\nAs we have seen this year in government, that is not all that's planned for spending, as the Coalition released a detailed plan this morning to pay for the cost of its education and health policies.\n\nThe plan, with its mix of tax hikes and spending cuts, says the Coalition will have saved the budget $36 billion by 2015-16, \"with no additional tax increases\" and \"without significant welfare or health spending cuts\". If that is true, Australia's debt and deficit should both increase to $250 billion in 2015-16, instead of the $125 billion we've been seeing so far.\n\nSo where do we get the other $50 billion from? We begin the answer to that question with another question: Do the Coalition's plans add up? There is not a lot of evidence to support them and, even if they did, that would not explain where the savings are coming from.\n\nThe Budget Papers reveal there is only one tax the Coalition hasn't said will be abolished: the 3 per cent Medicare levy. \"We will get rid of that,\" Mr Pyne said Thursday of the current 3 per cent Medicare levy, which Labor argues must be scrapped. It is a charge the Coalition can't really say it's cutting, since it hasn't even mentioned it when it is considering its spending targets.\n\nThe Coalition's \"savings\" are not even all tax. A further $17.4 billion is to be found in savings from an array of measures proposed for universities, but not yet determined. The Coalition also plans to slash funding for the Australian Commission of Audit, and use the savings from that to reduce the funding of the Australian Human Rights Commission.\n\nThe government still plans an extra $6 billion in funding for the Australian Taxpayers' Alliance. It would be difficult for the government to reduce support for the tax-monitoring organisation while also reducing spending on other issues. If the government was saving money on \"social services\", it wouldn't have the money to pay for an extra AATC commissioner.\n\nThe budget papers indicate that the plan to eliminate the third of the four base-schools levy is more to do with revenue than \"savings\". Instead of eliminating the school levy and shifting the revenue to higher education, the budget paper proposes that \"a funding arrangement\" be worked out to \"avoid a return to the base-school structure\". It doesn't say what such an arrangement may be.\n\nNo plan for tax minimisation: Treasurer Read more\n\nWhat is clear is that a substantial amount of the savings to be found from the Coalition's various spending plans will be made without affecting other areas of the budget. The budget papers show $33.5 billion is saved from the tax break for business income. That is money that would come from reducing corporation tax, but it also has no affect on other spending priorities, from healthcare to education. Meanwhile, many of the $11 billion in savings for families from abolishing the second income tax bracket are already locked in as a result of changes the Abbott government made to marginal tax rates back in 2009.\n\nIn the context of a government that seems to be running in on spending every budget announcement it makes, it is not clear why the government would insist so adamantly that the cuts in its education and health measures will add to the economy. The budget papers indicate that there are no planned increases to pension, family support or the hospital dividend. The only \"savings\" mentioned are $10 billion to spend on improving the infrastructure. That's not savings but merely \"investments\" and neither are they the kind that have been made by previous governments. That's because these are only \"priority investments\" – those which are needed to \"address shortfalls in infrastructure and funding\".\n\nThe budget papers do suggest that the Coalition's policy of introducing \"income management\" for families, including child care, is being designed to protect spending while protecting people's rights to fair treatment, but that doesn't account for any reductions in payments to families, including allowances.\n\nTo see the policy as \"savings\" without paying for it by reducing social services spending is an utterly incomprehensible position. The plan to reduce subsidies on fuel and electricity is one of the most unpopular policies in Australian history, but that has not stopped the government from implementing plans that have the most disastrous implications for health and education.\n\nThis has become a matter of serious public debate in recent weeks. On the one hand, the government has consistently refused to answer basic questions. On the other, the prime minister and other members of the government have talked about savings while talking up the benefits to families from this budget. It is both irresponsible and morally offensive. There is no need to \"spend like you saved\", especially when that \"saving\" does not include addressing other areas of government spending.\n\nThe government promised an election promise", "label": "gpt2"}

She said that before she could find out if it was serious, she had been kidnapped and taken to the police headquarters.\n\n\"I was crying and shouting for help and they told me that if I cried I'd get beaten.

When she called the police station for an update she was told to go there. Within an hour the police arrived and she was again taken away.\n\nThe story, which Farkhunda repeats verbatim, gives a picture of how the police in China operate.\n\nIt is not unheard of for relatives (unusually from among China's ethnic Han majority, which accounts for 70% of the population) of victims of crime to protest against what they perceive to be government excess - or to call for the release of their loved ones. But the way the police behave during the events is entirely unprecedented, says David Coleman, a researcher who studies ethnic relations at Lancaster University.\n\n\"The reaction taken by the police - the use of force and the detentions - is unprecedented,\" he explains. \"The police here just don't seem to know what to do next. They're just going to keep trying to do this until it's over, and they have no idea where to go after this.\"\n\nHe says the authorities have been trying to pin the blame for the unrest on the protesters by suggesting it was a plot, but Farkhunda, who has no children and a husband who is ill, says it was not a conspiracy.\n\nFarkhunda is still not sure why she was detained, or when exactly that happened. But it seems clear that a number of people were imprisoned, and were released late on Sunday night after several hours, or that they had their days in prison extended for more than a day, depending on the source.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption There were numerous protesters during the mass protests\n\nAmong those being seen by relatives as having been arrested was the well-known actor Li Bingbing.

She said that in recent days she had gone shopping in the town.\n\n\"The shopping plaza had been completely blocked off - no traffic, no pedestrians, shops shut.

{"text": "Your baby is soaking six to eight cloth diapers or other disposable diapers every day! She and her baby will soon have about 5-6 cloth diapers a day — and it is not unusual for a healthy baby to have as many as 12 cloth diapers a day, although the number may be less after she finishes breast-feeding. (See A Baby's Guide to Clean, Dry Cloth Diapers for more details)\n\nTo keep her clean and dry, don't let her sleep in a place with only one or two beds, or anywhere with lots of hard surfaces.\n\nMake sure she stays away from bedding that is more than 4\" thick. Cloth diapers should be no thicker than 3/4 to an inch or so. This will not only keep her clean overnight but also keep her from getting chaffed or smelly poop and poop that is hard and crusty due to bacteria build up. She is not designed to walk well on fabric this thick! She may also want to avoid wool bedding, but it is OK for most babies. You can buy \"baby-friendly\" cloth diapers with very thin cotton threads such as the Klean Kanteen Cloth Dried Cans. Many of these are made for babies ages 4-8 months and are very inexpensive. If she will not wear them, you can make your own and wash 'em. If you don't mind getting your hands dirty with cloth diapers, you are well on your way to keeping a healthy baby safe from infection!\n\nWhen he is ready to begin wearing his diapers, start by doing a quick clean and roll-out every few hours, especially in the morning. Your baby will definitely be tired after the day's activities (and if you can avoid it, go out in the fresh air after the baby has slept). Make sure he gets his fluids and some love before you start getting him ready for cloth diapers. The next time you are ready, just do some quick roll-outs and keep those cloth diapers in good shape.\n\nTips for Helping Your Baby Cloth Diaper Diaper Trouble\n\nSo, what's the most important thing you can do to help your baby wear his cloth diapers well?\n\nDon't be concerned if your baby has a \"diaper rash,\" or any skin reaction to the pads on his diapers. For most babies, these reactions may be mild and go away with time. If your baby's reactions are more severe, or if he has trouble wearing the diapers or feels very uncomfortable in them, and you notice his skin is becoming red, shiny, itchy, and dry, you may want to bring your baby to the doctor to discuss this.\n\nIf your baby is wearing his disposable diapers with the diapers being wetted out with a wet wipe and a warm wet cloth (called a \"wet napkin\" on some cloth diapers or a \"tote\" on others), he should be dry, shiny, and clean before you wash them!\n\nThis isn't a medical condition called \"allergen cross-reactivity,\" where one baby will easily get sick from a protein from another baby's diaper! This is more like the skin reactivity to a chemical that is on all those other disposable diapers you were so worried about! So bring your baby to the doctor if any of these reactions occur:\n\nReddened, pink, irritated, or tender skin\n\nIrritated, red, itchy, or sore eyes\n\nSwelling and redness of the skin on the buttocks or underarm area\n\nSevere itching\n\nBloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain\n\nNot eating\n\nA general sense of ill- health\n\nIf the reaction is severe or lasts for a long time, and you suspect that your baby is more or less allergic to one or more substances in cloth diapers, he should get checked out by a doctor. This is especially true if you are having trouble with him wearing disposable diapers!\n\nIt's very important to use an allergen-reactive wipes and spray when you are washing baby diapers. These can't be cleaned with the soap recommended on the wipes, so it is important for you to be sure they contain a specific allergen that is safe to put in cloth diapers!", "label": "gpt2"}

Go on into the sunset, my good man.\" We got the hell out of there first thing and went to the airport to catch the next flight home to New York.\n\nBut the next night, at about 11 pm, a plane filled with us met some other travelers at JFK, because nobody could believe that it was one of the great rock bands ever. The band was called the Band and they were a big hit with tourists around town. They got all the men out of their seats on the plane, but one woman said, \"Cann't these guys sing? These guys should be famous.\" She was quite right and the band did indeed become famous.\n\nThen another passenger, who wanted to be known as \"Johnny Rotten,\" gave them a lift to our hotel and drove them home that same night.\n\n\nI'm sure nobody will mind my referring to all this as \"Guru's trip.\" (I say that to illustrate the fact that, while I was there, in my case, it was the first such trip that anyone had taken by a group.) I should point out that, in all my years, I have traveled in a group only twice. Only at the age of 9, I was traveling by myself during a period when I was more interested in being a traveling salesman than a traveler. At the age of 17 in the summer of 1944, as an apprentice driver for a trucking company, I had traveled all over Europe and by that time I was somewhat of a traveling salesman because the road between New York and England was a real trip and the only way I could make the trip was by driving my friends, who were all traveling salesmen, around the country. It took me several weeks to learn the map of West Coast roads and a few weeks more to start driving. I would be driving from town to town and talking about a business trip.\n\nIf you've done any traveling and kept abreast of what's going on with the news, you know that in the spring of 1940, the news from Europe was pretty dire and all of Europe was going to Nazi concentration camps, except for Germany. Some things would appear different — for example, in Britain the Blitz was going to last a much longer time than it did from June until November, 1941, and Germany would be able to put up an offensive that would be almost as devastating as Pearl Harbor.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that at this time, and especially in 1942, a time of great conflict in Europe, the popular traveling salesman in North America was always called \"Guru.\"\n\nIt was, apparently, a tradition of a large number of traveling salespeople that people who could not travel in an emergency, either as a result of their military service or during World War II, would call upon one of their number to come along on trips. After World War II, the travel sales business of North America suffered a big blow — salespeople no longer had a traveling partner, even though all the companies operating in the United States had salesmen in all 50 American states and in several other countries. I had been doing long-distance selling for a few years before I became involved in the travelling sales of a large mail order retailer — the first such business in North America, as far as I know. I took over the traveling business of my friend's business and started selling travel over the telephone.\n\nGuru's first trip in the spring of 1943 was, indeed, on behalf of a member of my traveling sales network, who was in the service. By this time I knew a great deal about aircraft (I was the first airplane mechanic in the Western world to have his aircraft repaired), I was a very good listener, I knew many people, and I had already written one book. I also had a good idea of how to make travel entertaining. This was the first trip Guru ever took, and as I had been taking most of his business in the mail, I arranged to have Guru speak in the local radio station of New York- New Jersey area on Sunday, May 20, 1943. Guru also arranged to do an interview with a radio broadcast in New Jersey on May 29, 1943.\n\nGuru and I had been traveling to various towns in our network over a telephone connection we had made which I had not had time to use up to here on the road. On this Saturday morning, during his interview in New Jersey, Guru announced the fact that he was flying to Los Angeles to talk to an English paper's reporter about an article he had just written about a trip he had made to Canada. I have never been able to remember from whom Guru had written the article, but he told the reporter, who is now deceased, that he came to Canada in 1934 and was a salesman in Edmonton for a considerable length of time.

{"text": "To the east is the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River, which meanders northeast from the Gulf of Mexico to run east to the Pacific Ocean. This area has experienced relatively warm and dry periods at the beginning of the Holocene, leading the researchers to believe that a high-fat diet could have played a role in enhancing plant growth and productivity.\n\nBut before we start gobbling up carrots, cabbage and turnips, there's a key thing to understand: the study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nIt's a great paper! But is it completely relevant, relevant scientifically?\n\nDr. Peter Hogg, a professor at the University of Bath (along with Dr. P.F.W. Tielmann, I think) has been a leader in understanding what dietary impacts would have had on our evolution. When he looks at our primate relatives, Homo sapiens, he's fascinated by the changes they seem to have undergone when they gained a higher caloric intake after the advent of agriculture. The key difference between these animals and us is how many calories they are consuming.\n\nIn the case of chimps, we're getting a hefty 20 to 25 percent of our calorie needs from plant resources; monkeys, our closest living relative, are consuming less than 3%. And it appears that the dietary changes we've made to ourselves have a disproportionate and unintended effect on our health than our fellow apes: it's not enough that we've become larger; we're becoming sick; and we are far more susceptible to coronary heart disease and cancer than our primate forebears.\n\nIt's no surprise that a diet lower in calorie density also seems to lead to obesity. When researchers looked at populations around the world they found that, globally, over the past 20 years or so, about a third of all adults are obese. In the U.S. that number stands at about a fifth, according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n\nAnd it's possible, it really is conceivable, that if the average person in a modern industrialized Western country were eating less calories, they'd be not only fitter and more energetic, but be perhaps healthier as well.\n\nAs these experts point out, though, it's crucial to remember that there's a lot of data available on the effects of diet on health, from humans, animals and plants alike. There's much about our lives that don't have anything to do with fat or calorie density. Our hormones, digestion, reproduction and evolution are all governed by complex, interacting processes that likely evolved because they make us stronger, more energetic and longer-living. A diet that doesn't necessarily lead to better health simply because it's low in calorie density simply isn't an answer that's relevant enough for research to take place.\n\nAs of yet Dr. Hogg's study has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, so it's difficult to say whether the findings are relevant to our time or not. But, I think that this kind of diet-induced physiological response is just one of the many opportunities that could open up to us when we understand the biology of our own species.\n\nThe potential for a great understanding of this biological reality is really exciting.\n\nWhat has your experience been in going into the lab with the goal of figuring out this mystery?\n\nWell I do work with the lab at the University of Bristol, which has quite an interesting background. It was founded by a guy named David Sinclair in 1947 to look at the effects of different diets on different mammals in different environments. So they study a lot of carnivores in the Arctic, and they work with the great apes to study for example, their metabolism.\n\nI sort of got lucky in that I was able to join an experiment as early as 1984, which was the study on fruit and vegetable consumption in primates. So, we were interested in what was going on physiologically in our primate counterparts, at the base of the food chain, when it comes to their diet. What did they eat? How does it affect metabolism in the body and their metabolic processes? Our study on fruit and vegetable intake in primates was really interesting. We found that even though there was a lot of variation between species in terms of what sort of fruit and vegetables were consumed, the commonalities remained. This led to us hypothesizing that the fruit and vegetable we ate probably had a similar effect on metabolism in this study group versus primates that were fed different diets. The most interesting thing that's occurred since then is that people have since become interested in this in a broader sense, including other food groups and other mammals, for example the baboons, the bonobos and monkeys.\n\nIt's been suggested that there are some health markers in fruit and vegetable consumption as well.\n\nMaybe. I can't be certain though, because it's something that hasn't ever been studied before. I'm sure that that'll become available some day.\n\nThe other thing that", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "we present a theoretical analysis of the propagation of light, focusing on its dispersion effect (light dispersal), light emission (radiation), and transmission [1] where as we discuss the effect a small, distant object (e.g., the moon, which is relatively bright) can have on the illumination of a distant light source (such as a light bulb connected to a wall) [2]. The following description of the fundamental physics involved is based on the authors' book Physics of the Moon, including all mathematical aspects [3]. The theory is also based on Newtonian mechanics [4.1].\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a vacuum, the vacuum state has a definite wavelength and zero phase. But in various objects, if there is an external source of light (e.g., a light bulb; see Figure 1) and it emits light (e.g., through a tube or window), the light will scatter (or, more appropriately, be scattered by particles scattered from the source and absorbed by the surface of the object itself; e.g., light bulbs are made of many thousands of thin layers of material that absorb and reemit light), either in the same direction as the light, or in all directions, depending on the incident angle of the light.\n\nThis scattering will cause the light to lose frequency, which is a quantity expressed in the form of a spectrum, which represents the combination of all frequencies in a given electromagnetic wave. An arbitrary object or surface emits and absorbs light (e.g., the moon). However, if that light is scattered by other objects (e,g., the objects are large and the moon is small, as in Figure 1), a signal, or interference pattern becomes visible and the objects will form an interference pattern (i.e., an energy pattern), which is a continuous, unbroken wave. The wave cannot have the same two different frequencies if there is not strong scattering, because such a pattern would be difficult to detect by a human eye. In addition, if the light from the source is attenuated in the distance (as is typical of the case of a light bulb) and then reemitted, this pattern would be \"flattened\" out.\n\nAn example of an interference pattern is that which is seen in the Moon, where the moon appears to have a slightly darker, circular shadow on the surface, while the background Earth surface is illuminated by the sun (the surface of the moon is the background to the Sun). In this example, the pattern is due to the scattering of the reflected illumination by the dust on the surface of the moon. A similar effect can be seen on the Earth. The Earth's surface appears to have a similar pattern to that of the Moon as a result of interference between the sky and the sun.\n\nThe spectrum of light emitted by the earth is characterized by a spectrum that is composed of a broad band of the frequency range around 860 nanometer. The sky in the sky is brighter than the Earth, and the spectrum does not extend over the entire sky, but is restricted to a few selected areas. There are two bands, one being around 650 nanometer and the other around 680 nanometer. This spectrum is also reflected from the surface of the Earth and the Moon (this reflected signal is known as the refracted light). The first band, 650 nanometer is light in the red and orange portion of the spectrum, whereas the second band, 680 nanometer is light in the yellow, green, and blue frequencies. The wavelengths range from around 450 nanometer to 700 nanometer. Therefore, light in the 650 nanometer, 680 nanometer range reaches the Earth in around 600 nanometer by refraction and around 1000 nanometer by atmospheric scattering and is not transmitted efficiently by the atmosphere.\n\nIf the sky is dark, the spectrum can be seen on the surface of the moon, but as light in the violet and green (near-infrared) portion of the spectrum falls on the upper part of the lunar surface and is not reflected, the spectrum is reduced and does not reach the atmosphere, even though the light of the sun still reaches the Earth. In addition, if the sky is high (as can result from heavy clouds, such as cirrus) and the spectrum is concentrated into a region and the atmosphere does not scatter and the atmosphere is less efficient at scattering, the spectrum is reduced with only the violet portion reaching the atmosphere. If the sky is very diffuse and the sky is low, the light from the sun can reach the Earth at high wavelengths.\n\nLight is known to be non-uniform in its wavelength, thus an object, e.g., the moon, emits or absorbs light of different bands depending on how the object is viewed or viewed from another view point, e.g., the surface of the moon reflected by the Earth or the surface of the moon reflecting sunlight. Thus, the moon, which is very bright, will see light that is the yellow band more than the blue, which", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "a new kind of quantum indeterminacy of transverse position is observed in which an interference pattern of three different directions is observed at a distance of 3 mm from the source. This object is a single photon [13], and can be defined by assuming it to be a single quantum system and measuring its position. We find that its position is in fact determined by two quantum states and that quantum position in light-matter interaction depends on the nature of these interacting objects.\n\nA key issue in quantum mechanics is that the quantum-mechanical state of the system can be affected and even the behavior of the underlying system can depend on the state of the quantum system. For example, the two photons in Fig. 2 can be in different states, and they can be entangled [14] to influence the individual positions of the other two photons within the same experiment. The photons are entangled with an external photon-positron pair, such as the radioactive positron and ion, via a CPT of the experimenter in Fig. 1. The fact that their individual position relies on the other photons and not of the experimenter, and that the state of each individual photon depends on the combination of the photons it encounters, have been experimentally observed by a variety of experimentalists [15–17].\n\nA fundamental assumption in quantum mechanics is that no matter can appear and disappear in a quantum state instantaneously [18] (Fig. 5). Therefore, in order to measure the individual positions of two particles simultaneously, the two photons cannot be sent ahead of each other to the experiment. In this case, the source-observer system has to wait until the photons are sent asynchronously. For a quantum system, such instantaneous measurement would mean that each particle is simultaneously measured in its own state. This would be an incoherent state [19] and a contradiction to the theory described in the previous section.\n\nIn fact, the laws of quantum mechanics imply that the two photons are in the same state at the start of the experiment because they are simultaneously measured while the measurement device records their individual positions [19–22]. However, a number of measurement devices, such as interferometers, detectors, measurement beams and quantum detectors, can measure particles of different states simultaneously. As the photons that appear in both the detectors are measured simultaneously, their individual positions at the start of the experiment are independent. However, in a measurement device in which the particles could be placed in space, the position of the photons that appear in the one detector would always be at least partially dependent on the position of the particles that will appear in the other detector because, as we will see later, they are bound by the CPT that defines the state of the two photons. If we consider the particle-antiparticle interaction as a special case, if we consider the particles to be entangled with each other, only a measurement of the state of an interacting particle will determine its state at a later time. Therefore, in this situation, the state of the entangled particle depends on the values of the two particles at the start, which in some cases is very small [23, 24].\n\nIt is possible to overcome this limitation by replacing each observer with a second observer and making the entangled state of one superposition state, as shown in Fig. 6. In this case, the CPT can be extended to superposition states by adding \"coupling\" between pairs of observers [23].\n\nThe CPT of a set of quantum states may be described by two states that are identical to each other, one for each observer at the start of the experiment. The two states are called \"state 1\" of a set of quantum states and \"state 2\" of a superposition of quantum states of the two observers respectively. An example is given in Fig. 4. The two states of a set of quantum states (which will be called 1, 2 in Fig. 6) are superposition states because no observer can ever be in both states at the same time. The state 1 and 2 states can be found by calculating the probabilities of the states 1 and 2 for each possible measurement event, and then performing a probabilistic measurement to see if the measurement event resulted in a measurement at 1 or 2, respectively (Fig. 6). The probability that a measurement event at 1 would result in a measurement at 2 is 1 - 1/2; the probability that a measurement event at 2 would result in the measurement at 1 is 1 - 1/2. If the probability that a measurement at 1 would result in both measurements at 2 (i.e. state 1 of a set of quantum states), the state 1 and 2 corresponding to the probability of the set is the same (1/2). The probabilities of the superposition is therefore the same for any observer. Therefore, the states 1, 2 can be considered as superposition states of the quantum state 1, respectively. These superposition states are referred to as 1, 2 superposition states of the set 1. Since the", "label": "gpt2"}

Ben notes an incident in the local newspaper that tells him of the fanfic that started the World War I. Ben decides to research fanfic's and find out who started the events that brought down the Wehrmacht and led to the end of the war. This leads to them finding the real war. What follows is a story of friendship, honor, and the horrors of war, combined with a young adult story with magic. It is an epic adventure that will have you saying \"I want more!\"This novel has everything! We have characters, action, action scenes, romance (in a nonsexual way). We have humor, but it's a more adult-rated version of humour. There are two endings. At the end of this book you can decide a few things and have some fun, or you can let it end and get the ending you really want.This review has no images!If you've come to this review in search of a spoiler-free preview of War of the Fanboys then you might just be in luck. Since it's a YA novel, you'll not see any descriptions or images that might spoil any plot points. This is an enjoyable YA fantasy adventure that will appeal to fans of YA fantasy adventure books and readers of Ben Bova's short fiction (see my review of the first book of this series).My Rating: 4 out of 5 starsI reviewed War of the Fanboys because I wanted to get something out of a book I thought I'd never read. I never read YA fantasy novels and I had heard such a dreadful lot about them. I figured all the reviews were either from people who'd never read a book like this or people who'd heard of the book and didn't want to leave. On the day of release Ben contacted me and said the book was not a typical YA fantasy. \"It's more like Young Adult,\" he said. I was a bit skeptical and decided to read it alone. Once I started to read it I fell in love with it. I went back and read some of Ben's other fiction after reading this one and found more than an equal amount of entertainment. It was definitely a different experience reading War of the Fanboys than reading any of his other fiction. It's fun, engaging, and, if you're a YA reader, you won't be disappointed with it. I rate this 4 out of 5 stars.So what are you waiting for? Grab a copy the War of the Fanboys and start reading!!!", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer/songwriter Karen Carpenter, the woman who has devoted her singing life to making people laugh in the most unlikely places.\n\nAt the end of \"Barely Legal,\" the song on Carpenter's self-titled debut album about living as the opposite sex as many other people, the singer and songwriter gives a glimpse into the real world she is trying to create. Her friends tell her that they believe in her. They support her; their support lets her know that most people do. She's heard a ton of weird stories and jokes at bars, in locker rooms, and even at weddings. They tell her things that were once unthinkable in their community. Now, her friends see her as the same person they saw her before she changed her name, changed her body, and began to feel trapped.\n\nSome people have different opinions about the name change — some people find the name change offensive; some people find it liberating. For us, we see it not as liberating at all, but as threatening. Why is it so hard to let people make these transitions? If everyone who felt comfortable with their transition was able to do so, this would reduce the discrimination many transgender people face in everyday settings. Why can't we just change our name? Why couldn't Karen call herself Megan and nobody care?\n\nKaren Carpenter grew up in a small town in Texas called Mansfield, a suburb of Houston known as a hub for oil exploration. She was born into a close-knit family, the son of a well-respected Methodist preacher. Her father taught Karen to sing at church. The family lived in the small town that was known for its small-town ideals.\n\nHer father said Karen's father used to look at his son with disdain and tell him, \"you don't have a body, you have what I have.\" When Karen was young, her father was a very religious and strict man. He once stood up to Karen on a trip to the store. He was furious a local barber had cut the daughter's hair short. He said, \"This little twerp cut a girl short!\" Karen remembers the man telling her that his daughter couldn't ever cut her hair short again. Eventually, Karen grew more comfortable with her body, but she rarely spoke about it with others as this happened.\n\n\"There is a sense of shame, where if you want someone's attention for your own reasons, it is easier to be quiet and not talk about it,\" Carpenter said.\n\nShe said this is a very common thing she feels. She says it has kept her in the closet to this day; she doesn't know any transgender girl whose father doesn't say the same thing.\n\nKaren moved to Dallas to attend UT before she was ready to transition. She found a job as a makeup artist, but her boss was in a relationship with another woman and didn't know that Karen was a lesbian. It wasn't so much the work that bothered Karen, but the fact her boss thought differently about her than she ever had before.\n\nWhat Karen didn't realize at the time was that being a lesbian was the reason this situation was so awkward. She had always thought of herself as being attracted to men. She had been exposed to a gay community, watched them raise kids, and heard the stories of them. In fact, even as a child, Karen used to watch these kids at bars, and even in her teens used to go to bars to watch them get their nails done. It was an almost impossible scenario for her to ignore — having a man be attracted to her. To have to deny those deeply personal emotions was too much. In a desperate moment, she told her girlfriend she was a lesbian and never tried to hide it again. That was the beginning of Karen's first lesbian relationship.\n\n\"It was at that time, this realization, that I looked at my male privilege and said, 'how can I begin to fight for these things without taking things away from others as well?'\" Karen recalled. \"There are too many people who don't have things that I have.\"\n\nThis is why we have to take our privilege away, she said, because if we don't, they will never ever get it. That was what motivated the first song on her debut album, \"Barely Legal,\" which is about living her life on the outside looking in until she is ready to share her secret without fear of judgment.\n\nMany people who identify as transgender have found their way to Karen Carpenter's album \"Barely Legal\" over the years — when Karen sings \"brave\" she sings for a lot of others — because they know she has had to fight a lot in order to live her actual life. They know that she has struggled so much just to be herself in public (and even in her personal life, as an openly lesbian singer). She is a rarity.

These findings are corroborated by the high percentage of patients with either unilateral or bilateral cortical deformities. These findings suggest a complex relationship between cortical lesions and the perception of depth of field and may be a major contributor to the clinical picture of MS.\n\nThe importance of axial images in MS diagnosis can be understood in the context of the unique clinical presentation of this disease. The lesions found in the MS axial neuropathysm are not the cause for the clinical image. Instead, MS lesions can be caused by the pathological process of MS or by the physiological deterioration of one of its various stages that can be triggered by a range of pathological and environmental factors. It may be that an individual patient with an MS lesion is actually a hyperopic (or hyperopic-hypopic) patient. The axial brain images could be consistent with the clinical picture by making the distinction between an MS lesion (e.g., macular degeneration, meningioma, gliosis of the meninges) and a patient with another CNS tumor or disease (e.g., ALS). By using this criteria as a screening tool for MS, the findings from our study would potentially be more useful for MS diagnosing, and consequently, will be more likely to be found in MS patients.\n\nFigure 2.

It involves computing the expected intensity, which is calculated as follows:\n\nmax0 = mean(v0) / (abs(x-max0) + 2 * mean(v1) / (abs(x-max1) + 2 * mean(v2)))\n\nTo see a real example, see the CSPF paper. Notice, that the model uses DVP, DFT, KDT and DPV. For comparison, the -dipd and -dipm models work also for doublet problems, but the doublet model is much more complex.\n\nAll-Pairs Pairs (AP) models are the main algorithms in machine learning. They are more complex models in the sense that the alignment process is not used for all the pairs analyzed. The idea is to analyze multiple pairs and align the sequences correctly to all of them. The original motivation for AP models is to identify rare sequences. This can be done by using single-end sequencing or high-throughput sequencing techniques for detecting rare sequences in sequence databases. The original AP models can also be implemented for other alignments problem. A key feature of all-Pairs (AP) models is the fact that the alignment result is a collection of paired sequences, all of which have to be aligned correctly to each other. When comparing the alignment between two sequences, it can be helpful to examine the alignment between them for common pairs.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of AP models is that they align sequences without knowing the alignment structure (i.e. with just alignment information for one pairing). That is, all that needs to be done is to create a list of paired sequences (or other combinations of sequences); then, the AP models simply align all the pairs to that list. Of course, any number of different pairs can be used. The model can also be applied to N-pairs alignment (in which each pair needs to be analyzed independently).\n\nHere is an example for N-Pairs Pairs (NAPP) model and in which we align all pairs using single-end sequencing methods:\n\necho -n 'N:N P:T' >>./output/align_dipm_nAPp\n\nWhere N is the alignment depth\n\nP is (e.g.) the alignment length\n\nT is (e.g.) the number of shared boundaries (e.g., T1 and T2)\n\nWhen creating a -single-end -all-Pairs -all-pairs AP model, we first use a single-end alignment method, in which both sequence alignments are created at one sequence or several sequences. This corresponds to the standard AP alignment model; here are the steps:\n\ncreate pairs by aligning sequences using different single-end sequencing methods, without knowing the alignment structure; generate alignments, with shared boundaries between sequence pairs; create pair lists\n\nThis can be implemented in C by the function createpairlist(), that uses all of the standard function callbacks:\n\n#include <stdlib.h> #include <", "label": "gpt2"}

On the basis of his history, his physical examination, and the findings of the laboratory tests, he was sent for an EKG (normal), a CT scan (normal), a chest x-ray (normal), and a computed tomography (CT) scan (normal).\n\nTreatment for this patient was directed to rest, rest, and relaxation. He was instructed to stay off of all pharmaceuticals, to limit physical activity and vigorous exercise (further, he was told to wear a chest harness in order to avoid a pneumothorax). He was also told to wear a head collar to minimize the risk of aspiration of stomach contents and of swallowing fluids. He was given intravenous fluids. He was given a prescription for loperamide 50mg with instructions to take this medication at least twice a day to relieve his symptoms.\n\nA 48-year - old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency room with a 4-hour history of nausea, vomiting, lethargy, weakness, and fatigue. She was also experiencing acute abdominal pain, nausea, abdominal distention (pericardial effusion), and fatigue. On lab testing, she was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis due to a perforating ulcer and she was advised to continue with antibiotic treatment to control the inflammation. She was given intravenous fluids. A history of alcohol abuse, cocaine abuse, and marijuana abuse were also noted.\n\nHer physical examination revealed a head injury. On the basis of her physical examination, CT scan, and lab studies, she was instructed to rest, stay off of all pharmaceuticals and exercise and stop her sedentary behavior so that she could heal and remain free of the infection. A chest x-ray revealed a perforating ulcer in the inferior wall of her left chest, which had undergone subdural hematoma formation (a small air pocket between the soft tissue of the brain and the dural sheath of the skull). A CT scan revealed that the left hemoperitoneum had also been obliterated. She was then given acetaminophen for pain and nausea and was discharged home.\n\nA 52-year - old Hispanic woman presented to the emergency room with a 3-hour history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. She was given intravenous fluids for nausea and vomiting. She was also given an epinephrine autoinjector and was instructed to breathe normally on the medication. She had been experiencing fever and weight loss, and was instructed to follow the treatment instructions for her diabetes. She was also given an acetaminophen product for her pain and fever. A CT scan revealed a left hemoperitoneum obliterated and no heart or lung structures. Upon further evaluation, the patient had an acute pancreatitis with perforation of the left side of the pancreas and damage to the left pulmonary vein. Upon prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy, she was given oral meds and discharged home.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study was designed to characterize changes in the pancreas following perforation, specifically to evaluate whether the presence of a perforation was a contributing factor to the onset of disease or if other causes were involved in development and progression of disease.\n\nThe primary finding of this study was the significant change in the pancreas following the subdural hematoma perforation. In the present study, perforation alone was not associated with the onset of any significant clinical signs.\n\nIn a previous study, Corder et al [6] found increased pancreatic levels of FGF21 and increased insulin levels following perforation of the pancreas. These elevated levels do not appear in the present study to be indicative of pancreatitis.\n\nThe most significant finding in this study is that both the left and right hemoperitoneums were obliterated due to the perforation. The left and right hemoperitoneum are important in terms of the flow of nutrients and nutrients to the organs. Therefore, the loss of the left and right hemoperitoneum must be considered in addition to the significant deterioration of the pancreas postperforation.\n\nThe fact that the left and right hemoperitoneums showed only significant change following perforation further supports the concept that the left hemoperitoneum has some type of essential role in supplying nutrients to the pancreas after perforation and the right hemoperitoneum has some type of essential role in supplying nutrients to the pancreas after perforation. Therefore, the left and right hemoperitoneum are important not only as means of supplying nutrients to the pancreas during perforation but also to regulate flow of nutrients to and from the organs after perforation.", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "tuberculosis ( tb ) has been a disease affecting almost every human population in Europe since prehistoric times, particularly in the north and east, which has contributed a considerable portion to the rise of human populations in those areas. Its cause remains unknown. The last two infectious diseases (tuberculosis, pertussis, and small pox) were eliminated from European health systems in modern times with the advent of vaccinations. Most of the diseases that affected humans in the past have either been eliminated from our populations or have become relatively rare. In the past ten years, however, a significant number of diseases have reappeared.\n\nAs early as the Middle Ages, the use of opium, laudanum, mephitoxin, strychnine, and other drugs in medicine was widely publicized. The use of narcotics became widespread in Europe in the 16th century, and the use of narcotics in the U.S. since the 1890s probably predates that.1–3 From the 15th to the early 17th century the use of opium was a daily occurrence throughout Europe.4 It was also common in the Mediterranean region.5 The use of opium increased during medieval times and was associated with a significant rise in mortality rates.6 In the 17th century, the use of opium for pain and opium for \"indolence\"—analgesics for headache and backache—became widely recognized. The use of opium became widespread in Europe and spread to other continents by the early 1800s.7\n\nAlthough opium use was widely known and widely observed, its use continued until the 19th century. The first large-scale use for therapeutic reasons was noted in 1664,7 a time when opioids were used for a variety of disease symptoms. The first written record of the use of opium for therapeutic purposes in patients in London was in 1666. In 1676, John Wollaston, the physician to Queen Elizabeth, described the use of opium on children and said \"so great abuse of the drug in the treatment of the sick can hardly be imagined,\" while elsewhere his observations describe the use of opium to relieve the pain of spaying or castrating horses.8 In 1740 a London physician described a 16-year-old male patient in the hospital in which he worked who had been given morphine for post-operative pain.9 By 1840, there were some 400 papers in various medical journals that described the use of morphine for the treatment of various diseases.\n\nA remarkable change occurred about 1850 when the European nations began to use opium primarily for the treatment of chronic or terminal illnesses to relieve pain, as an anesthetic, for the relief of insomnia, and for the treatment of various opium withdrawal symptoms.10 In 1856 a Russian doctor, H.G. Myshkin, was one of the first to be trained in the medicinal use of opium and to publish a review on its use for pain, which received wide circulation in the medical literature. By 1860, there were about 30 thousand people receiving medical aid through opium.11\n\nIn 1870 French chemists were the first to develop the selective opium-precipitating solution ( POP) to treat many diseases. This was the first method of opium administration which worked effectively in the modern sense that it had the capability of controlling one's appetite to facilitate its delivery, without overdose. There were three basic steps: (1) the patient inhaled POP, (2) the POP precipitated in the lungs was excreted in urine or aqueous humor, and (3) the patient swallowed the urine or aqueous juice in order to release the POP in the mouth. Some patients became dependent on the POP-induced release of heroin from the tissue of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nDuring the 19th century, morphine obtained by chemical isolation was widely used as the agent of choice for its ability to produce analgesia. It was also considered the standard of care for its effectiveness in treating respiratory conditions and the pain and weakness of cancer patients. It was used, however, only occasionally for the treatment of the pain in cancer of the upper respiratory tract.\n\nIn 1879 Alexander Fleming discovered the structure of the analgesic analgesic. He named it morphine which in turn became the common name for all known analgesic molecules.\n\nToday, opium for drug use is administered by a variety of routes, from aerosol, topical solution, transdermal patches, or ointment to injection or injection into the muscle. Opiates are sometimes sold as prescription medication and may be dispensed over the counter (OTC) to the general public under a variety of names. Opiate overdose deaths have occurred rarely with the exception of an accidental overdose of codeine by four employees of the California Department of Health Services in 1985 that killed one additional employee and three hospital employees.12\n\nIn the United States in the mid-1990s, a new series of highly-addictive opioids has emerged.

{"text": "The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of the show, so I'll simply say it offers up a number of classic elements from film and television.\n\nA man, played by a man, and a woman, played by a woman, go undercover.\n\nYou don't have to know anything about the first element you watch in order to appreciate the second one, and neither do I, but what this show does well is give the viewer a feeling of immersion into what we're going to witness and how we'll experience it.\n\nFirst they meet, a new woman named Elsie Smith (the only woman in the film) and she's going undercover to find out about another organization using children as spies. While we see the action from her point of view, we're privy not only to her opinion of the man we're seeing, but also a bit about her history.\n\nThat man she's going to meet is Joe Keiser, one of the lead employees of Keiser Intelligence, so it's not like she's gonna have any sympathy for him. She's going on a mission to try to get information about the family that runs the organization, and Keiser is one of three men that she finds out about. She falls in love with him immediately.\n\nThis is a love scene between two people and it's one of the better parts of this film. You really get a feeling of how they're meant for each other from the second she arrives in the house until they kiss just a few lines later.\n\nThe other two men are played by the same man and the two men do have very different opinions of the other, which is a problem given that the two men have two very different paths in life with their two distinct personalities. What I appreciated most about these men was the fact that they're the only two characters to have an actual scene with them between both acts of the movie.\n\nAnother great part of the plot is the fact that you don't really get to see all of the kids on the set. It's very likely that you will find certain characters in the film with whom you'll know more about. The kids are given multiple moments of characterization and you're allowed to understand why a certain character has the reactions they have. There's a part where Keiser's young son goes out to play and comes home with a friend and they don't speak and that's only a few minutes in the film. This is one of the few films that does well portraying the growing pains of growing up.\n\nThe kids act like teenagers and it shows. When you see the two kids that don't quite fit in with those that do, it's difficult to imagine them as adults, but that's exactly what they are. They get caught in the middle of a political war between two sides, and you can guess what'll happen next.\n\nThis film was made for adults, but for the most part, it's a film that feels like a film meant for any age. The only thing older I'd ever even consider is The Matrix, and I don't give a shit if you want to point at that as a bad example. It's a great series for any age.\n\nOverall, this is a great film. I recommend it.\n\nThe film stars: Paul Giamatti\n\nRating: 7 as an adult, 10 as a teen\n\nI Am Legend (1990)\n\nIt doesn't matter if you think horror belongs in the \"genre\" category. Some films just do it better than others, and a lot of horror doesn't belong in the \"genre\" category.\n\nThere's no denying that IAmLegion is a classic horror film, because it's definitely a horror film. It's about a woman who is kidnapped by a group of people and she ends up being in their town. The way she's treated makes her feel as though she's being treated as a slave and a bitch for not doing what they want, which I can relate to to some degree as well. But we watch this film as a group and we see her being abused with every opportunity, and the group eventually decides to kill her instead.\n\nYou know, if you want to play the blame game, if you want to go onto YouTube to have a lecture about movies or whatever, blame IAmLegion! But then again, I also don't give a fucking shit who caused the genocide.\n\nNow, I can't help but feel that this remake is a very modern classic. It's almost like an updated version of some of the movies that you've probably seen on the Twilight Zone. That's not to say those movies aren't good films. They are. They just don't share a lot in common with the modern version of this film.\n\nThe film opens in a hospital, where a woman is being treated for a gunshot wound she got in a fight with her husband.

{"text": "With the windows down, I sang along to cheesy Mediterranean pop tunes on my iPod while looking through old pictures of my parents' trip. One picture showed a man, clearly not my dad, running after my mom through a field dressed like a soldier in camouflage. I knew this was my dad who, like my grandma, liked to take his clothes off in public because it was his way of being different, of being an outsider. It was not the same as my dad's choice, which was to be more humble and more of a \"normal\" middle-class guy. I felt as if I wanted to run, too, to be part of this family and participate in this weird show.\n\nIn the next photo, I saw my dad with my mom's friend. I knew the picture wasn't me, but I still wanted to see who he was with — an \"other.\" I ran over to him and began to tell him I was sorry. My father didn't want to hear it. He stood up and walked toward the bushes, turned toward me and told me if he saw how happy I looked that night I would go to prison for a long time and he would have to protect me. In my father's eyes, an invisible child had turned on a mirror, just as my mother always told me to do when I was angry. She'd warned me that the adult world would treat me accordingly. She'd told me that I needed to learn to act nice and behave like a \"grown-up.\" But I was not a grown-up, he said as he walked away. I was supposed to be this girl who didn't know she was a girl, who wore pink lipstick and played in her mother's makeup bag. I was supposed to want to dress up like a \"man\" in adult situations, so that I wouldn't be attacked by the grown-ups, the strangers everywhere.\n\nAfter making that statement of rejection, my father and I walked out into the parking lot and watched that van on the side of the road. The sky was blue, and it was so quiet. We sat in our car together and watched the news, then we stopped at a gas station to get fuel for whatever it was that I was about to do that night.\n\n* * *\n\nA few days later, I took my dad to a baseball game. I told him how nervous I was. He laughed because he knew how much I liked baseball and that I loved being out there with all those people, especially my dad. We saw the Mets play the Dodgers on Sunday, and then we went to a pizza place nearby. I told him that I needed to be alone, alone with my thoughts — that something needed to happen right then, but I was determined to think about something else. I put my glasses back on my face and looked at my dad, then looked at the sky. My father told me that I never needed to be alone and that even when I was alone, with my thoughts, I was still happy. He said that I was a great daughter, that I did everything right. He told me that he was proud of me because I didn't take this decision lightly. All of these things made me happy. That, he said, was the only way I was ever meant to be.\n\nHis words made me feel relieved. I didn't need to tell him about my boyfriend at work. I could give my father some peace. But as I was leaving the store with him, I thought back to some words he had written in my notebook. Before he left for the game with my friends, he had written something different. He wrote the words of a parent of an eight-year-old girl who is transgender.\n\nIn my notebook, I had written: \"I was born with a male body and I have always wanted to be that girl. Now I am. I am so happy.\"\n\nI remember looking around at everyone as they went to the ballpark and I looked at myself, my face completely covered with makeup. I felt embarrassed. I wanted to keep looking in the mirror, but instead I walked away from the store with the rest of my family. I had to look her in the eyes, but I wanted to look away. I wanted to avoid the stares.\n\n* * *\n\nMy dad was not alone — people were with him. People who had the same dream to be that girl. People who also made the same promise to protect me. People who didn't just watch the game with him and his friends, but also the rest of his family and even his neighbors. People who showed me the signs that were in my journal that read: \"You can be happy.\" Others were like old family members. They shared the same dreams as my dad, and people were with them. When I looked back, I recognized many of these people — my cousins, aunts and uncles, my mother's friends. Each and every one", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "PhotosYou've seen them on TV. They're the better—and often the more—quality images. What you might not have seen is the work that goes into capturing one of these gorgeous photos. I'll explain how the Canon 1DX Mark II's 18.0 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor works, along with a few tips and tricks. You'll receive over 10 hours of continuous on-camera time to see how well the Canon 1DX Mark II captures these stunning images.\n\nWant more video from the Canon 1DX Mark II? Here's a quick run-down that will show you how it all works. If you're a hobbyist, there's more.\n\nImage Files I had a question about some images. I know the image is a little blurry, but why is it blurry? The answer to my questions is pretty simple. The image file was captured using the Raw image format by the Canon 1DX Mark II. Raw files, which can be shot to any of Canon's cameras, give you full dynamic range where possible and retain the resolution of the original film or digital media. (Some cameras have a special RAW mode which can be used with other raw formats to achieve even more incredible results.)\n\nThe following video show you one of the first images you'll get from the Canon 1DX Mark II's 18.0 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor.\n\nRaw files are the best way to shoot the Canon 1DX Mark II, since the sensor is better than anything else on the market. This is in large part because of the ability of the 1DX Mark II's 18.0 megapixel CMOS sensor to capture images at all ISO settings, even up to 6500.\n\nCanon 1DX Mark II vs. the Canon 1DX\n\nAlthough you might be under the impression that an APS-C sensor is better at low-light photography, the Canon 1DX Mark II gets there without a doubt. This is in part because of the sensor's excellent dynamic range and low contrast. In addition, a sensor like the 1DX Mark II's can capture colors you've never seen before (e.g., the purple in \"Rainbows Before and After,\" below).\n\nCanon 1DX Mark II vs. the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS STM Lens\n\nThe 1DX Mark II's image quality is impressive, but it was a little surprising to see how much better the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS STM Lens performs compared to the Canon 1DX Mark II. With the 14-bit RAW format available on the Canon 1DX Mark II, it makes using an all-around standard lens like this one a more economical choice, although still not ideal when you're shooting in HDR mode and need a wide angle zoom to do the job.\n\nThe camera's great, but it needs to be optimized for its features — more on that in a little bit!\n\n1DX Mark II's Optical Built-in Lenses\n\nI'm a fan of Canon's wide-angle zooms, but I knew this would be a good focal length if my primary purpose was to use it on the 1DX Mark II. After reading about how great the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS II USM Lens was for the Canon 1DX Mark II, I didn't hesitate to order a copy of that lens.\n\nWhen it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. For its price and size, the 70-200mm lens really delivers!\n\nCanon EF 70-200mm f/4 L IS II USM Lens\n\nCanon EF 70-200mm f/4 IS USM Lens\n\nHere, you can see the Canon 70-200mm IS has a nice size of just under an inch long and a weight near a pound, making it one of the more lightweight lenses I have in my own collection. For more information on the Canon 1DX Mark II's 17-55mm IS, you can read my full Canon EF 70-200mm f/4 IS USM Lens analysis to learn more.\n\nNikon 1DX Mark II vs. Canon 1DX versus Nikon D7000, Nikon D40, Nikon D70\n\nWhen I first started shooting with my Nikon 1DX Mark II (review), I was surprised by how well these lenses performed. I'd never shot a zoom lens with no lens hood and always had my lens hood with me, since I wanted to protect my eyes from the lens. Not anymore!\n\nNot much difference between the 1DX Mark II and the 1DX, but when shooting with 1DX images, you will see a very slight increase in dynamic range in the shadows.

The children then get to spend their holidays with the gang members, who make money by selling the children to men in the capital.\n\nThe report published on July 11 by Spain's National Assembly Commission on Children showed that the gang, members of which are under police and judicial watch since 2013, operate in several countries, including Russia, Serbia, Romania and the United Kingdom—an indication that the practice has also been active in the United States.\n\n\"Children are kidnapped and sold to criminals … to continue the cycle of kidnapping,\" the commission head Jordi Rosendo said of the report, published on the website of Spain's Ministry of Justice.\n\n\"We see the existence of networks, in which children are recruited by people who try to persuade them in the name of pleasure or their own advantage,\" Rosendo said.\n\n\"The worst thing is the willingness of the girls to do the best that they can to please the men they are meeting on the streets,\" he said according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.\n\n'Traffickers are making more money than they did five years ago'\n\n\"Traffickers are making more money than they did five years ago,\" said Rosendo, adding that traffickers are taking advantage of the fact that traffickers working in Russia face higher taxes and that the new European Union-Russia Association Agreement is creating new opportunities for business.\n\n\"We've always lived with criminality, with drugs, extortion, kidnapping and extortion, there were always gangsters present, you know—bad guys.

{"text": "the involvement of reactive oxygen species in various diseases has been shown. This review summarizes the knowledge regarding ROS in brain injury using various experimental approaches. ROS are potentially harmful as they are emitted from cells damaged by injury and damage causes cellular degeneration. ROS are usually produced in the brain during various pathological phenomena including arechemic brain cell damage and ischemia, microvascular or oxidative damages, hypoxic brain injury and oxidative stress, inflammatory brain injury, cerebral ischemia and micro- or nanostructural brain injury. Thus, ROS are responsible for a variety of biological events in tissues and cells. ROS are activated in various pathological conditions through a number of pathways including reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by antioxidants, apoptotic mechanisms, and direct damage from free radicals, particularly reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS in brain have been described and are primarily responsible for metabolic, metabolic and pathophysiological cell death. ROS can act through the generation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species by oxidants, including ozone, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide and H 2 O 2 and are also involved in the activation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in various pathways involved in the pathophysiological states including neuronal plastic, neuronal death, protein phosphatase activation, apoptosis, cytokine generation and cell cycle arrest. There are a variety of ROS in the brain and a great variety of cellular mechanisms involved. Furthermore, the role of ROS in brain injury is very complex, considering the many ways in which ROS can lead cell death.\n\nBrain injury is a clinical and research field of great importance with different approaches and strategies used to deal with brain injury. In addition to the extensive literature on the role of ROS and the cellular damage following brain injury and the potential role of antioxidants in brain injury, a variety of experimental approaches have been developed in order to detect and quantify ROS and to identify ROS-specific proteins. An abundance of experimental models have been developed to investigate various neurodegenerative processes after brain injury including ischemia, cellular death, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. It will be described here that various mechanisms of oxidative damage and ROS generation after brain injury have been examined in the laboratory and in vivo in various models. Such experimental approaches, if validated, can provide a very good basis for the treatment and understanding of brain injury, particularly in neurological patients.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical object. However, if we think of the class P to be an array of integers, then the class is in fact a higher order operator, similar to a function. In fact, the operators are also called infix operators because the operator is applied directly after the arguments. Also, some operators have the class precedence. For example, == is not in the list of infix operators.\n\nTo be able to recognize the arguments to a function you need to call it with the arguments you have. Moreover, to understand how the argument is passed as a list, you need to understand the structure which allows you to see all the arguments at once. In other words, there are several different structures which allows you to make the arguments as a list.\n\nThis post will discuss the structure of the functions from the following list:\n\n+. +, and -.\n\n., and. -. and %.\n\nand. *, %1, %2,....\n\n, %1, %2,.... /,. /, and /^.\n\nThe next post will discuss the structure of the arguments to the functions from the list:\n\n&, |, <<, >>, ^. and ^^.\n\nand Finally, we will discuss the structure of the data types used by the functions and their relation with the functions.\n\nData types\n\nLet's first go through the structure of the structures we mentioned in the previous post.\n\nHere are the structures of the data types we mentioned:\n\n{ x : Type; y : Type }\n\n{ x : Type; y : Type }\n\n{ x : Type; y : Type; s : Type; s : [T]; s : [[T]] }\n\n{x: Type;y:Type}\n\n\nIn a regular function, each of these structures is the actual argument of the function. In contrast, for functions which are overloaded, we provide a structure for each argument. The structure specifies what type of arguments the function can take. In other words, \"I want to do this, so I have a structure called s\".\n\nThese data types are sometimes called data-structures. Here are some examples:\n\nMap is a list of strings.\n\nis a list of strings. Set is a set that includes elements of different types.\n\nis a set that includes elements of different types. Dictionary is a list of key/value pairs.\n\nis a list of key/value pairs. List is a sequence of functions.\n\nis a sequence of functions. Array is a list of arrays.\n\nis a list of arrays. Seq is a sequence of numbers.\n\nA data-structures contains these elements. Here are some examples:\n\nThe List data-structures contains an array of Strings which is equal to the string (1) and an array of Booleans which is equal to the boolean (false), that is, {x:false}.\n\nstructures contains an array of Strings which is equal to the string and an array of Booleans which is equal to the boolean which is, that is, {x:false}. The Array data-structures contains an array of Strings which is equal to the Strings of the StringList, so it could be equal to {s:1,s:2,...,s:n,s:m,s:f}. (That is, {s:1,s:2,...,s:n,s:m,s:f} = {1}, {2,3,4,5,...,q}, so each argument is an arbitrary number of Strings or Booleans.)\n\ndata-structures contains an array of Strings which is equal to the Strings of the StringList, so it could be equal to {s:1,s:2,...,s:n,s:m,s:f}.

{"text": "Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but with an unproven hypothesis being tested, further testing is recommended. This test compares and contrasts the results from the current model compared with the model of the unknown. The similarity of two models should be the same if the class with both classes are identical in the class matrix. Thus two models should look roughly the same if they have the same number of unknowns from both the current model and one of the proposed unknown classes. It will be hard to get a more precise idea by comparing the relative sizes of two unknown classes, but it will be good enough, as any difference less than about 40%, will be acceptable.\n\nIt is usually difficult to figure out which class is right, and hence, a good strategy for using our proposed test is to use the proposed class as-is and to check that there are no differences that would require a new test. As an example, suppose for instance, that the Class 1 with a large number of unknowns is the same as the Class 2 model, but the Class 3 with small unknowns is different from the two classes, and the two classes are still of the same kind, i.e., two similar-sized classes. Assuming that most of the class variance will come from the Class 1 in our test, this is a good indication that this class is the correct one.\n\nIf tests are to be performed on large numbers of classes, this method is likely to be not sufficient, especially if some classes are well-understood when compared to the proposed class. In the end, a test where we identify classes without testing them will be very wasteful. The proposed class test does not guarantee that the test will be applied. Rather, it is intended to help determine whether our proposed class is the class of interest. If the proposed class is not significant, yet does not rule out others, then the test should still be run.\n\nAnother reason to not use the class test is that it does not take the number of classes into consideration. For example, consider a class of 20 classes, each with a size of 10 or 15. Let us be conservative and estimate the probability for all classes to have non-missing data. We will then use the method of bootstrapping (described below) to estimate a range for the probability value. We find that the class is not significant in about 14% of the sample. We could estimate a new probability for all of the classes and call it P = P(P(t|t |t)) for any value of t. Thus we have no way to know (with certainty) what the probability value is for a random class. We have no way to determine whether this is a true probability value.\n\nSome problems that could arise are noted below.\n\nClassifier based on some known classes (as proposed here) can have certain strengths and weaknesses. We have discussed several below. For instance, the problem that the proposed method cannot easily adapt to data from different domains is problematic, as a classifier should be developed to cope with the changing domain. Similarly, the fact that the test is not trivial is considered by some to be problematic. There is a wide variation in the complexity classes and their distribution in nature\n\nOther than this issue discussed previously, there are also some weaknesses associated with classifier-based classifier approaches, described below.\n\nThese weaknesses, however, are not specific to any single proposed solution that is used in this paper. As above, there are several other proposed classifier based methods (such as the random forest method) that share many of the weaknesses described in the paper.\n\nAnother proposed classifier-based method is to use a classifier based on the clustering function in [9]. This function can be used for clustering an ensemble of classes. Using clustering function based on classification task and k -fold cross-validation, we can create a single classifier, like the ones suggested in the paper (see S2 Table) and which can be tested on both known and unknown data (see above). Of course, the function used in this paper is specifically a clustering function, it does not scale well for example across data types.\n\nAlthough this method can result in a more flexible classifier, it is not as suitable as the ones mentioned above. It is possible to improve its flexibility by using multi-class clustering, clustering the classes by their distribution rather than on the number of classes.\n\nAnother proposed classifier-based test is similar to the ones used in the paper. However, the proposed method in [4] uses an arbitrary decision tree, whereas in [3] the proposed method used asymptotic method which are used by most existing classifiers. If a test like that proposed in [3] can be done reasonably well, even on known and unknown data sets, how much improvement can be achieved if instead, a decision tree is used which will be better suited for unknowns?

I was able to use it pretty much as I did before the Xbox and the Xbox 360. All of my old games work on the old Xbox. I play most of my games with a keyboard and mouse from Halo 1 to Halo 3.\n\nConclusion\n\nXbox One is a great game console for those who like the play more games and enjoy video games but it also has its issues such as not having the same quality of graphics from its predecessor that it has now or having the same graphical flaw that will not cause a problem for those who have an older display in their house (720p or lower resolution). Its not the game console for all gamers. For some it will be a better gaming device that is much more affordable and will fit in their budget.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy playing games on my Xbox 360 and enjoy watching videos on Hulu. I am also enjoying the Xbox 360 games I've bought over on eBay. When I do my research for the best game consoles for sale, most of my picks are Xbox and I've found the Xbox 360 to be more affordable as well.\n\nTo any of the Xbox fans who want to go back to Xbox 360 and buy a game console for the first time. Here are some things to consider\n\nThis is the Xbox 360 version of the console. It is the same game console that was released in November of 2008 but now it runs for 10 years. In regards of memory, the Xbox 360 has 512MB of memory compared to the Xbox One's 2GB memory memory, with Xbox 360 games being on average 6 GB in size. For that reason, Xbox 360 console games are more expensive.\n\nI believe most Xbox One gamers will also upgrade to an Xbox One S if they are going to install the game console on their new console. They will also know that they will save money if they get their game console from Amazon for around $200 and the Xbox 360 sold for only $130 before.\n\nIf you are not a gamer then you can go back to an Xbox 360 and buy a $60 Xbox One at Amazon and if you are able to save more than $60.

{"text": "In regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in 2004 that the term \"company\" may include a group of a single person and, if so - a \"co-operative association\" (G.Z. v. P., 2004, 11 EHRR 1).\n\nWhile the courts in Switzerland do not seem to define these entities in relation to the other two categories, they do hold that the existence of a company does not necessarily confer rights arising from ownership and/or the use of property. Furthermore, in the event that one of these entities does acquire a number of shares, only those shares that the group members are obligated to use - and not all of them - may be given away.\n\nWhen does the term \"group\" mean the group of several persons, i.e. an independent association, or a group of organizations (as in the case of a bank)?\n\nIn such cases, all the members of the group are considered to be members of the group regardless of whether in the context of the entire association or of some of its parts. This concept is referred to as the \"general rule\" or \"common rule\" of the law of associations (Articles 1.1 and 4.3 of the Swiss Constitution).\n\nHow are associations dissolved?\n\nA number of ways are available to entities that wish to dissolve, including dissolution through dissolution proceedings (see the Swiss Administrative Code, article 46), termination of existence (see Art. 28 of the Swiss Civil Code and Art. 15 of the Associations (Bundeskriminaliteitsdienst) Ordinance), or expropriation (see Art. 41 of the Swiss Civil Code and Art. 21 of the Swiss Administrative Code).\n\nHow are corporations incorporated?\n\nThere may be several ways to incorporate an association. The most common way is through a pre-legalization authorization (article 12.3 \"Pre-legalization\"). This can be accomplished by an amendment to the existing association's bylaws containing a provision that the current association, should it exist, is dissolved in accordance with the regulations of the Federal Government (this requirement is only effective if the Federal Government approves the amendment).\n\n\nAn alternative method is to incorporate an association together with another entity on the basis of an international association agreement or, even more frequently, an international association charter. In this case, the pre-legalization authorization requirement is removed and there are no further requirements to ensure the continuity of the associations' activities, other than the requirement to conduct meetings on a particular date.\n\n\nA second alternative can be enacted in the event of certain circumstances that constitute an impairment of a company's independence. In this case, the Swiss Administrative Code applies. There is a requirement where an association is incorporated in a foreign country that it may be subjected to \"foreign takeover\" or \"foreign takeover\" actions and where, in the event of the merger or acquisition of a competitor, it cannot act unilaterally. However, other considerations, such as the need for the new entity to be able to fulfil it's role as an economic entity, must determine such actions when both of these are considered to be relevant to the success of the merger or acquisition. Additionally, the law of Swiss administrative law also provides that an established association is exempted from paying the corporate tax.\n\n\nWhen does an association change ownership?\n\nWith the acquisition of a part of the group's assets, the remaining members of the group may, in certain circumstances, also change ownership. Such cases are addressed in the chapters below.\n\nWhat is the difference between an association and an independent association?\n\nThe basic concept here is similar and even closely related. On the one hand, an association is a legal entity that has come into being as a result of the combination of a single person and/or the other members of the association. It may also include other types of legal entities (collectives), such as companies or partnerships, that are used exclusively by the members of both the same- and separate-associations. An independent association is a legal entity with a separate status and which has not been a member of any association, or with only one person as a member. It may operate as a private company or a public corporation; it cannot be combined with other legal entities in any way so as to form a new entity.\n\n\nIs an association required to apply a minimum shareholding requirement?\n\nYes. A minimum shareholding requirement of 10% must always be applied. It is also obligatory for an association to appoint a corporate financial officer.\n\n\nThe association is a legal entity with a separate status, not the same as a private company. It cannot be combined with other legal entities in any way.\n\nWhat restrictions are imposed on the activities of independent associations in Switzerland?\n\nIn certain circumstances, the rules laid down in the Swiss Administrative Code (Articles 1.1 and 4.3) apply to independent associations. The law of associations provides similar restrictions to those applied to business firms.\n\n", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "paradoxes in the impact dynamics of rigid bodies are known, and the impact time-dependence of the velocity is often determined with respect to the inertia component and the impact force. A major problem in the interpretation of these studies is the difference in body mass and in the impact force used in relation to the impact velocity. In the previous discussion it was shown that the mass of a rigid body acting on the Earth, from the point of view of its momentum, is the square of the impact velocity. In general, the impact effects on the body depend on both the mass and the impact distance. Therefore, some authors have tried to use the mass when they analyze the impact effects on the body and others have used the impact velocity. In this respect, Newton's second law may be used. The impact force, according to Newton's second law, is equal to the product of the mass multiplied by the impact velocity. The mass of the solid body, the impactor, depends only on the mass but also on its impact velocity. In order to calculate the impact force, it is necessary to determine the impact velocity as a function of the contact and impact distance. Also, it may be found that the mass of the rigid body acts as a constraint in order to obtain the collision velocity in the free fall condition.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, and want to know who invented it. In the Middle Ages it was a typical term - it was in the Bible after all, and it made quite a bit of sense and was clearly used in various contexts in the Middle Ages. But in recent decades a number of authors have claimed that the word dates back to the 9th or 10th century in Arabic or Greek, and it's only recently that historians have found a precise date for the first usage - a date that is far older than the Latin root. This has led to a number of \"Avenir\" accounts that claim that the word originates with the Islamic word arf or araf or arafr, and that the first use in French dates back to the time of the Prophet Mohammad or even much earlier, although it's generally agreed that the word was coined in the early 13th century. But it's not quite that simple.\n\nFirst, arf is not the direct translation of the Hebrew word \"arif\", but rather refers to a group of birds (the genus Cercopithecinae) native to the Near East. In Arabic, the word arf was an early form of the word \"arf\" or ar-f (\"for the sky\"). In the Quran, for example, the Quran has an interesting reference to the arf in this verse [Quran 9:26] as well as several other passages: \"The face of your Lord is above the highest heaven-heaven.\" And \"But they refuse, in order that thou shouldest say to them \"You ask a lie.\" Say: verily Allah hath created you from dust\" (the arf refers to the earth and heaven and is used as a plural form).\n\nThe Arabic root of arf is rahf, a word that had previously been used in an unrelated context in the same connection: the Arabic word is related to that used in the noun form of \"rajf\", an Arabian term which refers to the first two letters of the Hebrew word (with the suffix zaf) and means \"prince\", \"ruler\", \"lord\". So it was not difficult to understand how the Arabic word arf (which meant the sky, etc) from the Arabic word rahf (which meant \"prince\") could become a term with the same meaning.\n\nIndeed, several words with the same meaning have already been used in Arabic before the Arabic word arf ever entered the lexicon. For instance \"rahfah\" - \"prince\" or \"ruler\" (which has also been used in Egyptian to denote a kind of deity) refers to the Arabic king Abu Jahfar. Another Arabic word with the same meaning (which is related to the Hebrew word arf) is al-Rasool, which has been used in Arabic since the 7th century for the Arabic word for \"king\". Indeed, the same root has been extended to English, as \"araf\" or \"arr\" (which also means \"prince\") has been used to designate the ruler of Egypt from the 9th century, to the Roman emperor Vespasian, to the Greek and Roman emperors Vespasian, Vespasian I, Titus (both of whom were the most powerful kings of antiquity) and the later Byzantines who took Constantinople. So there's every reason to believe that the word arf in this context was already in common use long before the 14th century.\n\nBut other linguistic arguments can be raised, too, which make the idea that the Arabic arf was actually translated from Hebrew into French seem less likely. There is no clear evidence that the Hebrew arf referred to a bird or something else non-bird. A number of theories can be devised on this subject (and a bit of research will reveal there is at least one other theory), but there is nothing so compelling to suggest that \"referring to the sky\" is an example of a homonym that could easily be used in languages with different root words. At least none of the arguments seem to be based on the idea that the two words are mutually intelligible to begin with, as there are several languages that have both words and no word that translates to \"the sky\" in the English language.\n\nFor example, Spanish has a word that means \"the sky\" (luna), which has a meaning related to the Hebrew word arf, and also has its own origin of Latin arbo, related to the Greek word arbos. But there are other words used for \"the sky\" in Spanish, such as \"el rolo\", which is essentially the same thing as German Reisen, Latin rei and Greek kyrios (a common word in ancient Greek that means \"sky\"). Spanish already had one word on the lexicon that referred to the sky, which could be interpreted as something close to the Arabic arf, but it was not", "label": "gpt2"}

Starbucks says the new system is faster and requires less user interaction than the one it replaced in 1995.\n\n\"Starbucks is always looking to build new ways to make our customers' lives easier,\" said Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. \"The first steps toward that goal for us were the introduction of Tap & Go at our stores in the fall of 2015. Our goal is to continue evolving using new ways of thinking and using real-world application in our stores to make shopping through our service more convenient and entertaining than ever.\"\n\nThis new system allows for easier order processing and faster return service, while at the same time simplifying customer use by reducing unnecessary steps and complexity, and simplifying how items are displayed on the screen for ease of use.\n\nThe new system is rolled out this week in three new markets and expands to 13 other cities by the end of the year.\n\nThe new system also includes features that allow customers to quickly scan barcodes on their smartphones using the smartphone tap-and-pay feature. In the future, these features will allow customers to scan barcodes that are automatically uploaded to Starbucks's mobile app, as well.\n\n\"Tap & Go adds more than a little bit of magic,\" Schultz said. \"Tap & Go is not something new. Our customers are already familiar with scanning a barcode with a mobile device. For them, this new feature just adds an even smoother shopping experience. There is no additional equipment being used and there is no separate app needed on their phone.\"\n\nThe new platform will offer improved customer service, Schultz said, along with new and improved products and services.\n\nFaster service\n\nTap & Go allows customers to save orders to their phone, rather than having to pull out their wallet or purse, giving them the chance to have them ready on top of a drink, and be ready to eat shortly after.\n\nAfter customers place an order at a Starbucks store, they can select the option to save their order for later. When an order for a drink is completed, it can then be instantly scanned at any Starbucks store. Customers don't even have to leave the store to save their order.\n\nTap & Go also creates a more exciting shopping experience by offering new merchandise options. Today, customers can place orders with any selected product as a gift for some one in the house.\n\nThe new service brings together Starbucks customers who are regulars who take advantage of the company's Tap & Go offer on a daily basis, and also those who only make purchases once or twice a year. In total, Starbucks estimates that there are more than 800,000 mobile order-receiving accounts, according to CEO Schultz.\n\nOrder-receiving orders can provide a better shopping experience as it gives customers the experience of ordering things in the place they like, but not the place they need. Starbucks Tap & Go makes this experience possible for all customers, regardless of age and location.\n\nStarbucks hopes the new digital ordering system will be a more pleasant one for everyone, Schultz said.\n\nA faster shopping experience\n\nTap & Go will also help Starbucks offer a superior shopping experience to its customers. Customers will receive a prompt when a new product is available and their orders are delivered to them the moment they need them. This will make shopping for a gift more convenient and allow staff to get back in the queue faster.\n\nThe new digital ordering process will be used in all U.S. and Canadian stores. Starbucks employees will be on hand to guide customers through the new interface that Starbucks plans to unveil in the coming months. Schultz said store managers are \"pretty excited\" to work with Starbucks to deliver customer experience enhancements to the customer.\n\nThe new system will continue being rolled out in many other countries around the world throughout 2016.\n\n\"Our new mobile ordering system will mean we offer better customer service around the world. We have been able to expand our digital and mobile services and products to more than 800,000 people every day. As we roll these out, we hope that our customers will have a greater sense of ownership and ownership of our brand,\" Schultz said.\n\nStarbucks says it has already begun working with customers to make Tap & Go even faster. When it was introduced in retail stores last fall, it was implemented using a mobile ordering app on a smartphone and mobile checkout (through the Starbucks mobile app). The new electronic system is being rolled out to Starbucks locations throughout the world using a mobile app.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian (the word is Chilian) who turns to crime. His mother dies of a cerebral hemorrhage, and his father hires an Italian man (Paul Sorvino) to impersonate his mother and arrange an anonymous sale of the property they share. His father gets his way, but before long there's trouble when his son is kidnapped by the mob. The resulting spaghetti Western has a number of familiar elements, but if you compare it to most movies about the same subject -- such as the original version of \"The King of Comedy,\" one of the most beloved movies of the '20s -- the differences are even more pronounced. The plot doesn't revolve around a high-powered hitman who can kill three men in four seconds; the character of the hitman is just to be used as a plot device. What follows are five hours of a group of characters who spend the main two thirds of the film being chased by various bad guys. But even so, \"The King of Comedy\" is a much better movie than \"The Godfather.\" The acting is much improved. There's no way John F. Kennedy could have played Uncle Sam or the mobsters. Still, the main difference between the movies is how they deal with a family relationship that has become a major part of American pop culture. The \"Godfather Saga\" and \"The Godfather Part II\" are filled with betrayals, fights, betrayals, fights, and yet they somehow become more gripping with each new act. \"King of Comedy\" is something else again. There's no reason for these people to be evil. They are just trying to protect their family in their own way. The movie also shows how important the family is at both its worst and its best. The death of a child or sibling is as big a trauma as the birth of a child. It's hard to deal with those situations when you never know if you will ever see your own child again. The story in \"King of Comedy\" shows the lengths to which parents will go to protect their children -- even when that means putting themselves in danger. It's an emotional story that should appeal to anyone who has had their family torn apart; for most people, having a child hurt or killed is something they can never forget. The best way to think of the movie is as a form of psychotherapy. Watching it puts you in the mindset of the people from the middle of the movie, as they go through the process without really knowing why. The ending suggests a kind of happy ending in which the family survives. The point of viewing it, then, is for you to discover what that happy ending might look like for your own family. That would probably be something much worse -- a sad ending.", "label": "gpt2"}

We consider a set S that contains only 1,000 values of α β and C 1a/B 1b L 1. We then consider a set Y consisting of these distributions Φ, and a subset S′ that is composed of S, all pairs of distributions described between the other two sets. We then perform the following generalization of the simplex method: Let L 1, L 2, … correspond, respectively, to L 0, L 1, L 1, L 2, … L 3, … L 5, … of S. We define a sample of μ, μ′, μ' and μ′′ to be the subset U (U′, μ') and U′′ (U′′, μ) respectively, in all of the subsets S′ (S) in Φ, μ′, μ′′, μ′′′, and μ′′′. We then define a set of samples given by the pair of Φ, μ', and μ′′, and also by the pair of μ′, and μ′′. This set is (U, μ, μ′, μ′′, μ′′′, …), that is to say, a simplex of all of the samples.

The first five subgroups are all of the form ψ 0 ψ ψ 1. With just this sample, the set of samples is (2,4), (3,6), (4,0), (5,0), (0,2), which would correspond to a simplex of all the samples. In contrast, the sample of ψ 1 ψ 0 ψ ψ 1 is in fact an empty set. This is because we have generated a set ψ ψ′ with 0 elements (the empty set).

{"text": "If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this makes sense. The past was a chaotic and disordered place where the law was often out of step with what it meant to the people who lived there. The present is a law-governed place, where the rules of the game are clearer, and the old rules haven't disappeared.\n\nBut in the early 1900s, this changed dramatically. During the first decade of the 20th century, the United States was going through a period that we now refer to as the Progressive Era. At this time, there was a concerted effort to make the legal system more functional and civilized.\n\nThese changes didn't happen all at the same pace. Progressive reformers had been writing laws on the topic of crime for centuries. However, while they were writing these laws in the early decades of the 20th century, many of them were written while crimes were still happening. This was because people were still feeling angry and fearful about crimes of the past, and so they couldn't let their frustration become a reality—or they wanted to maintain a certain level of fear—by being honest about the actual risk they faced.\n\nOne law, the crime and punishment section of the 1896 Omnibus Crime Bill, did just that. It made the public more aware of the threat that criminals posed.\n\nTo quote Slate, \"In the 1890s, the public had largely come to accept the idea that crime, not a lack of social opportunities, led to social ills. The 1893 \"Popular Science Monthly\" explained that \"the causes of crime will be found in the social condition of men; and the cause of reform will be found in their social condition.\" Many people wanted to believe that all people were made unequal by circumstances and bad upbringing. They might not have realized in the 1890s just how unequally they were made—\"as the public understanding of the cause of crime grew,\" the paper noted in 1898, \"there grew the desire to provide for relief.\" In other words, people began to feel that they needed to do something about the crime problem and get back to a better social position, which was a pretty radical thought in 1893.\n\nTo help them with this goal, the bill created \"The Chicago Crime Commission\" to address crime. It was tasked with researching and determining which crimes actually occurred in the city. (In most parts of the country, statistics on crime were compiled by local authorities, which meant that crime statistics could change drastically from year to year.)\n\nThe commission went about gathering this data. As the report says, many of the problems that people identified with crime were already present in many parts of the country. For example, in many parts of the country, people had witnessed violent deaths at the hands of police. As a result, many were convinced that police were the cause of police crime. As the report states: \"The commission is of the opinion that criminal justice as now practiced in the United States is essentially a police matter.\"\n\nWhile the commission was investigating police crimes, it also investigated the crimes that happened on the other side of police officers. So for example, it discovered that during the period of 1893-1897, a great many people in Chicago were the victims of \"vagrancy,\" which it categorized as \"unlawful and immoral conduct in the home.\" During this period, they were arrested without actually being given a hearing and then sent to jail. They had to pay fine to be released, which they had to pay in cash or credit. On a positive note, people were allowed to have food and shelter in their homes.\n\nOf course, in other parts of the country, police were responsible for the criminal justice system. So while the commission was investigating a particular type of crime, it was also investigating how the people themselves were being punished.\n\nThis was one of the most significant aspects of the story: how the federal government, with the help of local communities, were using the tools of the law to create order. It was also a kind of \"backlash\" against the \"new social order.\" Just as those opposed to the New Deal were using the \"old order\" to attack the New Deal, those in support of reform were using modern technology to battle a new social order. Technology was used to solve problems that had plagued the people for centuries and created an urgency to create new order.\n\nWhile the \"popular understanding\" of crime of the first decade of the 20th century might sound pretty simple to most people, it really wasn't. There were many \"law and order\" campaigns taking place at the time. In other words, they were advocating for a way of life that wasn't quite what most Americans wanted.\n\nThe phrase \"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\" wasn't coined in 1893, but it actually comes up quite often during these discussions of social order. These campaigns were based on things like a desire to clean up the streets and create more law and order. In fact, the", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "background : assessing educational environment is vital in determining the likelihood of student success at college. With this in mind, we tested the theory that the quality of educational environments is a major predictor of student outcomes. To test we examine six individual-specific measures of instructional quality in college institutions. This study also explores the relative importance of factors important to students' academic success. We find significant differences by race, gender, and socioeconomic differences among students who attended the same college institutions. We also find that college teachers may have powerful policy implications for how students are educated in the United States. Our findings suggest that our current approach to educational equality may not be optimal.\n\nThe findings reported in this paper are based on aggregated data derived from a nationally representative sample of 8,500 students enrolled at more than 1,300 college institutions across the U.S. We tested a theory that the quality of educational environments is a major predictor of student outcomes.\n\nThe literature on student motivation and performance suggests that a weak sense of belonging in school is correlated with negative academic outcomes.4 Students' sense of belonging is strongly related to whether they feel a sense of personal investment in being academically successful. Students enrolled in academic programs with low teacher quality are less satisfied with their academic achievements, and more likely to engage in substance use.\n\nIn previous work, we have found evidence for the connection of teachers' motivation to student outcomes.5 Further work is needed to define the effects of teachers' motivation on student outcomes. The question we address in this study is whether the motivational effects of teachers on student achievement are important for students' educational success.\n\nHow does teachers' motivation affect students' academic performance? We have long been aware of the relationship of student achievement with teacher motivation,6 and there is evidence from past research that increases in teacher motivation increase academic achievement, but also that higher levels of teacher motivation have an adverse effect on academic achievement by increasing nonacademic achievement (such as emotional competence).7 There is evidence across disciplines8 that a higher level of educator motivation is associated with high student achievement.\n\nThe importance of motivated teachers is also supported in recent research on educational outcomes.9,10 However, there is debate about whether the link between teacher motivation and achievement is causal. Some scholars argue that the connection between teacher motivation and students' achievement can be the result of students' achievement, rather than their motivation.11 Others, however, contend that the link between teacher motivation and student achievement is important. A recent review of this literature and a subsequent study (Dixon and Rimer 2013) found little evidence of the link between teacher motivation and student achievement. However, research using measures of teacher motivation to assess student achievement12 supports the notion that teachers with high levels of motivation are better teachers.\n\nThe role of motivation and other factors relevant to student achievement is often overlooked in research on educational disparities. Many researchers have examined whether race/ethnicity is a major factor in factors important to student achievement,13 but have often overlooked the importance of student motivation.14 Because many researchers have found that achievement measures (such as standardized test scores) can be correlated with other factors important to students' educational outcomes—e.g., family income, family composition—it is important to investigate the role of student motivation as an important factor for students' academic outcomes. Given the importance of teachers' motivation in shaping student achievement, we have proposed that teacher motivation should be a key variable to measure in order to identify which areas of the educational environment affect student achievement.\n\nOur findings are based on aggregated data of individual-specific indicators of educational environment that were collected at eight participating colleges or universities in 2003, 2008, and 2011. We tested a hypothesis that the quality of educational environments is a major predictor of student outcomes. We were interested in the predictive power of six individual-specific indicators of educational environment: (1) student discipline referrals, (2) student absenteeism, (3) student persistence, (4) student academic effort, (5) student emotional competence, and (6) student academic self-efficacy.\n\nWe examined student outcomes on the basis of four measures: student academic achievement outcomes, student well-being outcomes from a widely used measure of personal well-being, student absenteeism outcomes, and student persistence measures. Student achievements at any given college are expected to be correlated with student outcomes from similar colleges; accordingly, we expected to find correlations with student achievement on these four measures. If teacher motivation had an important effect on students, those students who had more motivation (i.e., higher levels of teacher motivation) should have higher achievement outcomes than those who did not.\n\nHow much of the student achievement difference among students is the result of motivation? We asked students whether their overall academic achievement improved or worsened on the final exam for their honors English course as a function of having been told by a teacher that \"Teachers who do a better job and teach more effectively are likely to work harder and score higher on the final exam\" (Table 1", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "a prime objective of welfare state activities is to take care of the poor. But the government's own census estimates show that poverty has become worse, not better, since 1980. The proportion of urban Indians who are below the poverty line has more than doubled in the last 20 years. Even a cursory glance at the census reveals the extent to which the poor have been made to suffer. As a result, the poor have become less and less willing to cooperate with the state. \"The poor will always want more and more and we have to give it to them,\" says a top bureaucrat, who did not want to be identified. It is a view shared by Narendra Modi, the new Prime Minister, who has made all his economic speeches off the cuff. \"The poor have a hunger for jobs, an appetite for education and a thirst for better health services,\" he has said. But there can be no such hunger, at least not if the new government is going to do its job properly. A more fundamental aim of the NDA government appears to be not to help those in most need, but to help the upper middle class. The government is likely to continue pushing for the universalization of education; it will take a lot less of the poor's money to spend on them than on the poor. There is little evidence that India's economic growth has been powered by the poor. Instead, the poor have had their jobs, or been helped out of poverty by the government. And for the middle classes, the growth has been far more subtle. As we saw, the government has been using its financial muscle to offer rich people a deal: if you let the government use up your tax-exempt status on your houses or businesses for a set period of time, you can invest more in India. It is the \"grand bargain\". \"The poor will always want more and more and we have to give it to them,\" says a top bureaucrat. His words, however, are hollow if he actually believes that the poor will put more money in his pockets, and not the tax-exempt house he will be able to buy. And even if he were right, this would only make things worse. The rich are not exactly starving; they are only suffering from the government's failure to provide them with affordable housing. A report published by Credit Suisse estimates that housing across the country is worth $1.1 trillion and it is this that will drive the growth of India's economy in the years ahead. Given that the rich have so much money at stake, what are the priorities of the government for making sure that the poor are helped the most?\n\nIndia's economic growth has been driven by the expansion of private housing.\n\nIt is also easy to see why India has seen such strong growth without the government's help. The government has spent over $300 billion (Rs 6.3 trillion) on infrastructure – roads, power plants, hospitals and so on. This was a lot of money when housing, education and health were relatively simple undertakings that could be paid for through cash transfers with a decent return to the recipients. Most of this capital investment does not look so impressive on paper but the benefits that it brings over the long term, such as cheaper food, cleaner air and cleaner water, are inestimable. In the last decade or so, however, the costs of this infrastructure spending have been mounting (see chart 1). The government could also have invested far more in public infrastructure. In the private sector, this means building new factories, roads and airports. But in India, the government has spent only a fraction of what it could have. Private companies that have used public projects as a pretext to shift factories abroad have been rewarded handsomely with easy tax exemptions. Even with low-cost borrowing, firms are only able to finance one private sector project in India at a time. The result is that even with government help, private companies can't invest much more. And the result is that the country has struggled with the very real problem of high levels of unemployment. In the past decades, the government paid huge subsidies to encourage manufacturing in India but this has proven to be a massive blunder. The cost of capital that was used in India has soared above the cost of production. Because of this, Indian manufacturing suffers from underinvestment. In 2014, for example, companies in the auto sector employed 8.8 million workers. But that is still only 16% of India's workforce. In a country as large as India, however, where is the government's incentive to encourage the creation of jobs? The answer may be that it has long been dead. The World Bank is, again, right in its assessment of India's development model. It says that India has the largest number of people in the world earning over $1.25 a day, a figure that has remained largely static over the past five years. And it is the lowest number of people in Asia which has also remained virtually unchanged over the past five years. India's gross domestic", "label": "gpt2"}

In this case, there was good preservation of brain stem function, but there is also evidence that myocardial ischemia contributed to the patient's cardiac arrest. In an age of high-intensity cardiac output with a small window of survival, it is critically important to determine the extent of the contribution of myocardial ischemia to this patient's recovery.\n\nOBJECTIVE To determine if prehospital rescue from cardiac arrest is possible in patients with asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or other heart failure and whether rescue can occur while the patient is using cardiac monitors.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-three patients (median age 75 ± 10 years, age range 22 ± 1 to 92 ± 13 years) with nonfatal acute cardiac arrest who were in general cardiac arrest (n = 39) and whose prehospital recovery status was categorized as cardiopulmonary failure, ischemia, ventricular fibrillation, or ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (n = 18) were included in this study. After a history and physical examination and a cardiac loop defibrillator or ventricular assist device were administered in one of three classes, patients were immediately resuscitated with the use of a coronary angiogram before any further monitoring. The cardiac monitors were maintained as the patients were moved to the operating room.\n\nRESULTS Of these 39 patients, nine were classified as being in the class of cardiopulmonary failure. Cardiopulmonary failure was defined as the absence of pulmonary artery dilation after 3 minutes of peak ventricular ejection fraction. It was defined by the presence of a positive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or electrocardiogram result. Of the 13 identified as having ventricular fibrillation, two (22%) were classified as being in the class of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia. Two patients (9%) in the class of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia survived to hospital discharge, and all patients had functional status. Survival to hospital discharge ranged from 3±5 minutes in the class of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia and 1.7±1.6 minutes in the class of ventricular fibrillation.", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "In 1854 at Ballarat there was an armed rebellion against the government – one of a series of them in the following years and culminating in a rebellion in 1858 or '59 which brought about the overthrow of the British Raj. This led directly to the Indian Act of 1860 which was so controversial that, though Parliament later repealed it, in 1861 the High Court of Appeal in Britain upheld it on the grounds that there was an 'imminent danger of the loss of life'.\n\nThe Indian Constitution\n\nOn 12 March 1857 this 'imminent danger of the loss of life' was realised when a mob stormed the office of the governor general and his wife and, at 3am, opened fire on what was left of the government before fleeing. This was the end of British rule in India. By March 1857 Indian armies had invaded parts of the old British Indian colonial power base, and, by mid-December the government in Delhi had been forced into making peace with the Sikhs at Amritsar – the only British surrender of its kind. By the time of his death on 1 March 1861 William Blake had written how Britain 'had lost her empire'. Yet no sooner had British rule ended that the Indian Union was formed in 1862 comprising the three British colonies of India, the Indian Protectorate of Punjab, and the British East India Company's Indian empire.\n\nThe Indian Union had a provisional government in the new Indian capital Calcutta (now Kolkata), but the main political bodies were controlled from Calcutta by the British East India Company, which retained its own seat at Lord's in London. The company itself was dissolved in 1894 and an independent Sikh state was formed, after its annexation of Punjab in 1921.\n\nIndian politicians, though not all Sikhs, considered the British Raj an unequal arrangement of unequal powers. For the British, though a far more powerful state, they were often viewed as little more than subjects under their rule. Sikhs, on the other hand, saw themselves as a distinct ethnic group and often considered themselves part of Hindu India (as were other smaller sub-groups such as the Tharu, the Brahmo, and others). The majority of non-British India was overwhelmingly Muslim but there were Sikh communities as well. The British had never been completely successful at assimilation, but they had found some way to make an agreement with India's most recent immigrants: the Sikhs. To gain their trust as a people the British allowed a substantial degree of personal liberty; but in return to the British the Sikhs were expected to contribute to the British empire and to abide by British law and regulations. They accepted that they would face discrimination and persecution by some of the more conservative elements of Indian society, but they believed that they could use their superior education and entrepreneurial skills to be a useful labour force. Though never a majority, they were at the forefront of the anti-Indian Upheaval and the movement by which British-backed politicians sought to overturn the Indian Raj by removing the Hindu emperor and his Hindu family.\n\nThe British Empire during the Sikh Rebellion\n\nThe British had, however, been unable to provide political prosperity in the new Indian Union on their own – a series of internal crises eventually forced their hand and the empire was ended in 1869 as the Empire once again came into being.", "label": "gpt2"}

There's nothing else to it, I love golf (even though I've never golfed much). Anyway, the game starts off in the form of an introductory story and then the following 3 chapters are all based off some sort of golf course. We can tell they haven't really researched the game or the golf world.The second chapter features the player trying to find his way around some abandoned golf course by using his map to navigate and finding out about it. This is how it looks, it has no story behind it. They're just following the directions on the map like everyone else.The third chapter is also the game's story, this one takes place during a tournament and in it, we learn about how golf is actually played and it's based off of the basic concept of puttingt. This is how it looks, it's not even close to a story, I think this is where the name of this review comes from.In the final chapter, we learn about a certain guy and his past and it's basically an introduction for the world of the game, the last 4 chapters are actually some of my favorites in the entire story. In it, there are a lot of scenes that took me a little while to get in the right frame of mind to read the text, there's even a scene where a guy tries to tell the story of how he got his game golf license and how it works, I don't really understand it, but the whole thing is well done and interesting.The only problem I can see it having is if the player has no previous understanding of the game or of golf, the game will be too easy for him to follow. The chapter in the very first chapter, where you actually play the game, it is actually easier than the first chapter of the game, it may even be more enjoyable for beginners to play. You have 4 choices to win a tournament, every one has its own strategy, you could play by puttingts, you could play by puttingt & putting, or you can play by taking multiple shots into the hole until you hit them in order to stop them, at which stage it looks like this screenshot:That's all really about it, it doesn't have anything amazing about it and there's nothing really special about it.", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "in this note we present several recent results for the MSCI All Country World Index, with the weighting being based on market capitalization at the beginning of the year. It is important to note that the index uses an \"all stock\" price index, so it is appropriate to consider the value of the assets held by each of the companies, and the value of their liabilities held.\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, we are going to treat the \"average float\" value of the companies within the MSCI All Country World Index as equal to the sum of their current market capitalizations. Note that this excludes the MSCI's debt securities, because a company needs to earn at least 10% (to be included on the Index's \"real float\") on its net debt before it will be able to include the debt securities on the index, and so the real float is always lower than the average float value calculated with a 10% leverage.\n\nIn the charts below, we display the current market capitalization of companies in the MSCI All Country World Index, along with their current market cap, and their average float value. The size of the bubble at the beginning of each market cap is indicated by the size of the dot surrounding the dot (or larger for large stocks) and the extent of the bubble based on the extent of the bubble (or greater for large bubbles). The dots also correspond to the MSCI's index values. Companies will typically show negative and positive bubble sizes.\n\nThe MSCI All Country World Index (the blue dots) rose dramatically over the past two months, rising 22.25% compared to March 2nd. However, it is important to note that market capitalization data is subject to seasonal variation, and therefore market cap is a very imperfect measure of the health of these companies. To address that problem, we will also provide a monthly market cap chart of the index.\n\nThe MSCI All Country World Index shows a large price/earnings (P/E), dividend paid, and stock pay ratio bubble for the current month, with an index value of 7, with a bubble size of 21% (based on the entire market cap value, not just the current market cap).\n\nIn the case of MSCI, the dot color is based on the company's most recent stock price (which is very close to the average float value, and so the dot may not appear in a graph where the company's current float is not included).\n\nCompany Market Cap Float\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS 3,814,966 7,086,800\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF AMERICA 2,978,084 6,938,858\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF CANADA 2,935,636 6,944,967\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF GERMANY 2,639,040 6,856,039\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF JAPAN 2,931,906 7,078,851\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF FINLAND 2,929,521 6,892,967\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF SWITZERLAND 2,921,738 7,043,850\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF LUXEMBOURG 1,847,732 6,878,894\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF SPAIN 1,848,664 6,892,967\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF CZECH REPUBLIC 1,945,680 7,044,766\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF PORTUGAL 1,942,050 7,027,860\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF INDIA 1,886,930 5,995,086\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF IRELAND 1,884,240 7,045,074\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF UKRAINE 1,864,632 7,013,737\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF IRELAND AND CYPRUS 1,837,837 7,041,639\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF KOREA 1,834,829 6,863,883\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF UKRAINE 1,817,400 7,039,631\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF CHINA 1,812,740 6,898,944\n\nMUNICIPAL BANKS OF THE UNITED STATES 1,734", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "Oxygen, as a supposed mild euphoric, has a history of use that was based on anecdotal reports — not clinical research. The evidence is quite weak, which is a good reason for us to not allow the general media to make sweeping statements about \"pure\" or \"organic\" products.\n\nPesticides\n\nPesticides are often used in organic farming, and they are often also toxic. The main pesticides in organic farming are herbicides and fungicides (like organophosphates — a known neurotoxin). And they are often toxic to human beings who consume this organic food and produce.\n\nAnd here's another problem: The majority — perhaps 95% of the products that contain these and other pesticides, are simply labeled \"organic,\" but often they are not. This is a result of the failure in organic standards, whereby all of these chemicals are allowed to be in our food, without a comprehensive testing process for safety. But even if the regulations had existed, they still would not necessarily identify pesticides that pose a health or environmental hazard. They would just mean that it is safe and not harmful.\n\nHere's a link to more on the issue of pesticides in organic farming: http://www.ecologicalfoods.org/organic-farm-plants/chemicals/organic-pesticides-and-additives-dirt-pesticides.\n\nSo here are some other examples of pesticides that are found in some of the top rated organic products, in order of the amount of evidence in the evidence that pesticides are harmful to wildlife.\n\n1. Glyphosate\n\nMore than 160,000 pounds of glyphosate was sprayed on the crops on organic farms in the US in 2007, resulting in the massive increase of Roundup Ready genetically engineered corn and soybeans.\n\nThis chemical is a very powerful herbicide known to damage both plant and animal tissues. Studies indicate that Roundup Ready corn and soybeans are extremely resistant to glyphosate but resistant to others, like mirex, the most toxic of them all.\n\n2. Chlordane\n\nThe main chemical in the herbicide chlormethiazole is even more poisonous than glyphosate. It has a high LD50 (the dose that kills 50% of the test subjects), and is extremely toxic to aquatic animals, including fish, frogs and turtles. Chlorpyrifos is an herbicide which has been found in other organic foods as well, particularly with strawberries and blueberries. These plants are grown without the use of anything else except the herbicides, and are sprayed with chlorpyrifos — with chlorpyrifos being used as many as 2-3 times each growing season, or nearly daily. And I'm sure the USDA is also happy to spray these plants for free, so they could be used for the same goal — not to protect the environment, but to make our food taste that much better.\n\nChlorpyrifos also has an EPA category of \"Pesticide of Concern\", with residues of chlorpyrifos being found in a significant number of samples of fresh produce. This makes it a great pesticide to spray for pest control, and the USDA even says that \"its benefits outweigh its risks\" when it comes to controlling insects in gardens.\n\n3. Pyrethrum\n\nPyrethrum is a neurotoxin that is known to be dangerous for aquatic animals and humans who consume it in large doses. When it is sprayed and applied to our food and crops, it is also added to these pesticides for animal and human consumption. According to USDA, pyrethrum is used to \"control pests in animals (such as poultry) and to control insects in crops (hay, alfalfa). Pyrethroids are synthetic compounds containing natural products or pesticides. They were designed to provide higher concentrations than chemical pesticides. As a result, the natural part of the substance that was formerly naturally occurring, such as pyrethrum, is the predominant chemical in pyrethrum and in the products itself.\" So basically, just because we use this natural part of the natural product, does not make it safe.\n\n4. Gamma Oxides\n\nIn 2008, the EPA determined that there is concern regarding the potential adverse effects of gamma radiation on human health. Gamma radiation has been found in certain organic foods as well. While not listed as an organic pesticide on our labels, we are definitely eating these chemicals and we are probably also giving off some radiation from the food we eat, as the chemicals used are highly radioactive (and not organic, but it still hurts humans!).\n\n5. Pesticides Like Pesticides\n\nWe know that when certain pesticides are used, we can learn just enough about these products to begin to assume a harmful pattern. We know that genetically modified organism seeds are very beneficial to human health, yet, we use GMOs and they are widely labeled as organic, so you may never know they", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) is a dedicated telescope that is a perfect choice for astronomers. Built in the late 1970s by G. Stadelmann in his workshop, the instrument is a relatively simple but extremely useful instrument for both amateur and professional astronomers. As a G-ray telescope, imager has a focal length of 6.3 arcminutes, and its imaging resolution is about 0.7 Å. By contrast, for comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope can only cover 10 to 20 arcminutes at its aperture. With these impressive numbers and aperture, a gpi image is very sharp, which makes it possible to obtain the kind of images that other spectrographs need to show. G-ray telescopes have a large aperture, as the name implies, and this allows for a lower power (lower energy) output and reduces the amount of light required to be focused. That, in turn, enables an image resolution (or signal to noise ratio) of about 1 Å, which is much lower than what is typically possible with spectrographs. The resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope, for instance, can typically achieve about 1.5 Å, while a typical resolution of gpi of 0.5 to 1.5 Å is common. Of course, the Hubble Space Telescope has twice as much money available (about 7 billion dollars in 2009), and could probably devote four or five times as much of its time and resources to this task!\n\nThe gpi telescope is mounted on the ground, with the camera's mirrors held in an open position above the telescope's optics. But its images are obtained by pointing the telescope directly at the scene, and by using the optics' correction features to correct for the distorted shape of the earth's surface and the Earth's atmospheric refraction. To produce the gpi images, the telescope's pointing is calibrated against a ground-based reference for the position and azimuth (horizontal and vertical) of the Earth and the Sun. Each gpi image is then imaged with two different filters. One such filter provides red wavelengths and the other provides blue wavelengths (i.e. ultraviolet). These filters are typically made and distributed by the manufacturer and are then applied specifically to the telescope's telescope mirrors. Thus, by adjusting the correction optics on the telescope mirrors by using the calibration filter on the camera lens for the correct positioning, astronomers can produce a wide number of gpi images with different wavelengths. In addition to its use as a spectrograph and as a G-ray telescope, the gpi is also very popular for use as a photography camera because it can produce high ISO images using a single exposure. For example, the NASA-funded Project Skyfusion uses G-prisms with high-ISO (ISO) film, and can capture very detailed images, especially in the blue and red wavelengths.\n\nFigure 1.

The pelvis may be compared to that of extant birds, yet the ribcage is much smaller than that of a full-grown extant bird. Furthermore, a common feature is that the abdominal organs are much smaller then those of dinosaurs, thus a lack of abdominal cavities. Most dinosaurs were herbivores although plant eating forms are present on several of the groups. The small teeth are found in proportion to teeth in extant organisms. In addition, the teeth appear to be well adapted to the diet: they possess ridges on their surfaces for gripping plant material and the sharp corners are likely for cutting while in chewing motion. A number of the fossil specimens are preserved in articulation and some seem to be fossil mammals.\n\nThe bones of the pelvis and ribcage are of a different structure than those of living vertebrates. These bones were attached to other bones by ligaments or plates. These bones are well developed; for example, there are only four bones present in the pelvis that are at all similar to those in living vertebrates. However, the ribcage is shorter in both the cervical and thoracic vertebrae than it is in living vertebrates. These differences are also found in the foot bones. The forelimbs are very well developed; however, there are no digits, as the foot never formed the forelimb. The digits, at least, are present in both the feet; they are also found in most extant mammals (except perhaps fish). The hand bones are also relatively well developed, with digits at the tips. The ribs and forelimbs are not connected by ligaments as with living members of the Dinosauria, and therefore were highly adapted to survive harsh lifestyle and habitat changes.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "we searched a short - term radio variability in an abandoned industrial site on the outskirts of Salford. We did not expect such a big signal and were not sure why we were receiving it and what kind of signals could be generated by the station.The Salford site consists of a warehouse and a few small buildings. It's very far away from the urban area, more than 500m, and there have been some very strong solar activity bursts in the past few years but no radio detections.There have been a few attempts to listen for these, they are very rare indeed and have been known for some time to be random.\n\nWe have recorded lots of activity in the past on this frequency, most of it was due to solar flares and the bursts that were recorded in late 2014 and early 2015 were clearly solar flares.\n\nThe first burst was a very weak burst of light with a frequency around 1250kHz. It appeared from a distance of 3.5km away and for some reason we did not hear this burst again after the fact. At the moment we do not know why. At least we know from our previous work that an irregularity or \"sudden death\" has to be at least 500kHz and we have never seen such a sudden-death burst before. This could happen as a result of a sudden drop in an antenna's input or due to signal suppression by some artefact in the detector.\n\nBut the most interesting burst we've recorded is a strong radio burst - but again one we still do not understand. It arrived at the site at 1231 hrs but was too weak to be detected. It is almost definitely some kind of an echo, which is explained by the fact that the station has very strong signals in other frequencies. This means that even the lowest frequency is being transmitted through the earth's atmosphere.\n\nAfter this burst, we started trying to figure out whether there might be some kind of an acoustic wave that could be generated by the station from the same location. We investigated how the radio signals get to and from Salford from the site and discovered that the signal propagation from inside the old warehouse to the main building and back again takes some time. This means that in a situation where the station is still in use a few kilometres away there might be some kind of an acoustic signal coming out of it which is picked up by the satellite.\n\nWe now know that all these radio signals might be actually reflections of the signals that originate from the central tower of the old warehouse - and there should be lots of them. We're now trying to study the possible waveforms that these reflections might produce. One thing that seems quite clear now is that these signals are most likely coming from the central tower of the building.\n\nIt is known to radio enthusiasts that if a very strong radio signal travels at the speed of light then it will travel from the transmitter over distances greater than the speed of light - for example, the speed of light is nearly 186,000 miles per second. It might travel for billions of light-years or to within light-years of any point in the known universe.\n\n\nThis picture was taken on 20th October 2000 and shows a series of three bursts from Salford, which was last used by a very powerful radio power station (S2VUK Ltd, Salford, in 1996/97.)\n\n\nThe main building of the Salford Radio Station can be seen in the centre of the picture. This is the first photo to show the building in use and was shot on October 20th.\n\n\nWe have located a collection of interesting documents of various descriptions about the use of the building. The documents indicate that the site was put into operation in 1976. We see that the building was used to transmit from around 1986 and then abandoned after several years until 1995. The pictures show that a new tower was built and operating in 1997/8. An old sign appears to have been put on the wall next to the old building.\n\n\nAnother picture was taken on the roof - in the middle window it can be seen a blue sign, clearly showing that it was an antenna used to reach the new satellite base.\n\n\nA huge antenna covered with a thick green tarpaulin can be found next to the main entrance.\n\n\nThe building was fully occupied when Salford radio was last in production, but a new satellite base was added to it in 1997/8. The sign was taken down in 2003 after building work was done to a different satellite base. No further work ever took place on the building and it was declared surplus in 2007 by the company who owned it.\n\n\nThe station was still on the air in 2008 when an artist and videographer named Richard Jones was inside putting some camera's on the roof, when he discovered that this building was the main antenna to the satellite base and he filmed the view out over the site. He was then attacked again, taken from the roof and badly beaten. When Richard", "label": "gpt2"}
{"text": "Google Drive is getting more Chromecast integration thanks to a new update. A new tab in the Chrome Web Store lets you use an open YouTube video window as your Chromecast's home, while new features like offline playback give you full control over the experience.\n\nCheck out the Chrome Web Store announcement for the announcement of the update in-depth.\n\nChrome has long supported Chromecast, but until now, YouTube videos weren't directly available for playback on the TV. That's changing with the new update to Chromecast.\n\nThe YouTube app, on Chrome and with the help of Chromecast, will allow you to share your YouTube video with the TV. A new tab in the Chrome Store will allow you to play any YouTube video stored on the Chromecast. Click on the Chromecast icon to bring up the YouTube app, and navigate to video details. Here, you can add your Chromecast to your collection, or save a YouTube video for you to play on the TV with your television remote. If you've linked your Google account, YouTube will send you a notification.\n\nIf you want to play a YouTube video stored on Chrome on a computer, you'll still have to play the video on your own computer first to make sure that you've got the version that you're looking for. Of course, Google says you'll be able to watch YouTube videos on Chromecast even when they're not stored on the Chromecast (or another device).\n\nAnd you do get offline playback, too, just not for just downloaded videos. Chrome says you can play YouTube with its built-in music and video player or on a computer that you can't access from the Chromecast. Chrome can also stream YouTube videos hosted on Microsoft's own Video Vault platform to a computer and use the Chromecast to cast those videos to the TV. That's useful if someone sends you a video from someplace you can't play it (with the Xbox 360 for example), because all you have to do is load a video in Chrome and cast to the TV.\n\nFinally, if you've linked your Google account to the same account on both the Chromecast AND Chrome, you'll be able to add that account to the YouTube app so you have an updated video guide instead of just watching the YouTube app.\n\nThis is an official add-on in the Chrome Web Store, so when you install it, you don't have to wait to see an update icon on your browser before you can watch a YouTube video on Chromecast.", "label": "gpt2"}

{"text": "\"Your iron industry is dead, dead as mutton. Your coal mine is gone – that's all. The government has no need for your coal, no need for the iron ore, and no one needs your mining or iron ore. Everything is dead.\"\n\nSo, Mr. Harper is making his final stand.\n\nHe is still determined to continue the push for Keystone XL. It is still his top priority, even though it is already clear the project will not go ahead. He continues to oppose the Northern Gateway pipeline to the West Coast, even though it is still being finalized and TransCanada and Enbridge have agreed to drop the project with no further delay. He still believes the world will come to its senses before it is too late.\n\nThe final battle is already underway. The oil sands industry is bracing for two new federal laws in just over three months, both of which are being pushed by the Prime Minister's office. The first, a review into the approval process for liquefied natural gas, will be pushed forward by Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver. The second is the bill to speed up the review process for pipelines that could have both oil and natural gas in them.\n\n\"The Canadian business community is getting a bit nervous,\" says Mark Cameron of the Canadian Energy Research Institute. \"Our best guess is that they are seeing a real threat where there's really no threat.\"\n\nBut the pipeline lobbyists are not waiting. Industry groups are warning of the risk of the new laws to their business with oil and gas companies. They have also started to focus their attention on what remains of the Northern Gateway pipeline, which is still stuck in limbo.\n\nOn the eve of the Harper's first election, Peter Watson, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, made several highly publicized visits to Alberta, including attending a rally at which one participant made a sign that said \"Don't make Canada an oil exporting nation.\"\n\nWatson has made it clear the current situation with oilsands extraction and exporting is \"an unsustainable one,\" he says, and the Harper government must deal with it immediately.\n\nLast year, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers urged the federal government to abandon its plan to phase out coal-fired electricity, arguing it would cost the country $7.4 billion. Instead of focusing resources on the coal industry, it argued, the government should focus its efforts on renewable energy in order to help cut emissions and tackle climate change.\n\nBut oil-sands extraction and refining remains the primary industry in Canada, so environmental groups are calling for the government to act more swiftly to protect the environment.\n\nAs for the Keystone XL pipeline, some observers believe that the pipeline is already at death's door. The American oil and gas industry has already moved on. So, the pipeline could face delays even after it is approved for construction. The project has faced the usual threats from activists and even some of former Republican president George W. Bush's cabinet members.\n\nThe Harper government argues the pipeline will create thousands of jobs for people in Canada and that it will generate billions in revenue to the national treasury. Opponents have suggested as much as $16 billion would be lost annually if a leak were to occur.\n\nBut, in his speech, Harper noted these facts are easily disputed. He noted that construction on the oil pipeline project was already underway, and his government was already investing the money expected under the project proposal.\n\n\"Canada's decision about whether to proceed with this project is a decision for our government,\" Harper said. He noted the Conservative government still believes in the pipeline. \"Of course, when you do business with someone you expect to do things your way — and you do know that you need to pay attention to what's really happening in the world.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister's Speech is delivered at the legislature in Ottawa.
